ITEM 1 – BUSINESS 
OVERVIEW
We are a clinical-stage genomic medicine company committed to translating ground-breaking science into medicines that transform the lives of patients and families afflicted with serious diseases. We plan to deliver on this mission through development of our clinical and preclinical product candidates leveraging our novel science and our in-house manufacturing capabilities.
Our Product Candidates
Today, we are in the clinic with first-generation gene therapy and autologous cell therapy candidates. Our long-term development strategy is to focus on leveraging our optimized zinc finger, or ZF, technology, a differentiated tool that we are using to develop next-generation genomic medicines, including allogeneic cell therapies and in vivo genome engineering therapies.
Our current clinical-stage product candidates are:
•Isaralgagene civaparvovec, also known as ST-920, our wholly-owned gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of Fabry disease, is currently being evaluated in our Phase 1/2 STAAR clinical study, and we have initiated plans for a Phase 3 clinical trial;
•SAR445136, our zinc finger nuclease, or ZF nuclease, gene-edited cell therapy product candidate for the treatment of sickle cell disease, or SCD, is currently being evaluated in our Phase 1/2 PRECIZN-1 clinical study. We are developing SAR445136 with our collaborator Sanofi S.A., or Sanofi, through June 28, 2022, at which time SAR445136 will become a product candidate wholly-owned by Sangamo;
•TX200, our wholly-owned Chimeric Antigen Receptor, or CAR, engineered regulatory T cell, or CAR-Treg, cell therapy product candidate for the prevention of immune-mediated rejection in HLA-A2 mismatched kidney transplantation, is currently being evaluated in our Phase 1/2 STEADFAST clinical study; and
•Giroctocogene fitelparvovec, also known as SB-525, is a gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of moderately severe to severe hemophilia A and is the subject of the registrational Phase 3 AFFINE clinical trial. We are developing giroctocogene fitelparvovec with our collaborator Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer.
Our preclinical development is focused in two innovative priority areas: (i) CAR-Treg cell therapies for autoimmune disorders and (ii) genome engineering for neurological diseases. Indications for our preclinical programs include neurodevelopmental disorders, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, tauopathies and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, multiple sclerosis, or MS, and Huntington’s disease, some of which we are developing with our collaborators Biogen MA, Inc. and Biogen International GmbH, which we refer to together as Biogen, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc., or Novartis, Pfizer, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda.
Our multiple collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies bring us important financial and strategic benefits and reinforce the potential of our research and development efforts and our ZF technology platform. They leverage our collaborators’ therapeutic and clinical expertise and commercial resources with the goal to bring our medicines more rapidly to patients. We believe these collaborations reflect the value of our ZF technology platform and will potentially expand the addressable markets of our product candidates. To date, we have received approximately $815.0 million in upfront licensing fees, milestone payments and proceeds from sales of our common stock to collaborators and have the right to earn up to $6.7 billion in future milestone payments from our collaborations, in addition to potential product royalties.
Our Novel Science
We are a leader in the research and development of zinc finger proteins, or ZFPs, which are abundantly occurring human proteins that have evolved to regulate the genome through interactions with DNA and regulatory proteins. We have developed and optimized a proprietary synthetic ZF technology platform with potential clinical utility in (i) genome editing and genome regulation, which we refer to together as genome engineering, and (ii) gene-edited cell therapy, which we refer to as cell therapy.
Our strategy is to translate our differentiated and versatile ZF technology platform to product candidates with best- or first-in-class clinical potential. For example, ZFPs can be engineered to make ZF nucleases, which are proteins that can be used to edit genomes by specifically modifying DNA sequences by knocking in or knocking out select genes. ZFPs can also be engineered to make zinc finger protein transcription factors, or ZFP-TFs, which are proteins that can be used to regulate genomes by selectively increasing or decreasing gene expression.
In the process of developing these genome engineering technologies, we have additionally accrued significant scientific, manufacturing and development capabilities, as well as related know-how, that are broadly applicable to the field of gene therapy, which we have used to develop our gene therapy product candidates.
Finally, we have also leveraged our ZF technology platform and technologies obtained through acquisitions to become a leader in researching and developing CAR-Treg product candidates for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in broad patient populations, including kidney transplant rejection, MS and IBD. CAR-Tregs are considered to have enhanced suppressive function over polyclonal Tregs due to the antigen-specificity introduced by the CAR. 
Our In-house Manufacturing
We believe that our in-house manufacturing capacity provides us a competitive advantage. We currently operate an adeno-associated virus, or AAV, manufacturing facility in our Brisbane, California headquarters and cell therapy manufacturing facilities in Brisbane, California and Valbonne, France. Our manufacturing strategy is to provide greater flexibility, quality and control by building a balanced and necessary capacity achieved through our in-house manufacturing and contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, partnerships, investing in manufacturing processes and analytics and developing a strong supply chain.
Business Updates
Isaralgagene civaparvovec - Fabry Disease
In February 2022, we presented updated preliminary clinical data from our Phase 1/2 STAAR study evaluating isaralgagene civaparvovec, or ST-920, our wholly‑owned gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of Fabry disease, a rare inherited metabolic disease. A summary of the data presented is below.
•STAAR is an ongoing Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging clinical study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of a single infusion of isaralgagene civaparvovec in Fabry disease patients ≥ 18 years of age. Patients are infused intravenously with a single dose and followed for 52 weeks. A separate long-term follow-up study is underway to monitor the patients treated in this study for up to five years following treatment. The study design provides for at least two subjects to be dosed in each dose cohort, with a potential expansion in each cohort. Patients who are on stable enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, may withdraw ERT after treatment in a controlled and monitored fashion at the discretion of the patient and the investigator.
•The dose escalation phase includes males with classic Fabry disease. The study is expected to be subsequently expanded to treat females, as well as patients with Fabry-associated cardiac or renal disease. The study’s primary endpoint is incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Additional safety evaluations include routine hematology, chemistry and liver tests; vital signs; electrocardiogram; echocardiogram; serial alpha-fetoprotein testing and magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, of liver to monitor for potential formation of any liver mass. Secondary endpoints include change from baseline at specific time points over the one-year study period in alpha‑galactosidase A, or α‑Gal A, activity, globotriaosylceramide, or Gb3, and lyso‑Gb3 levels in plasma; frequency of ERT infusion; changes in renal function, cardiac function and left ventricular mass, measured by cardiac MRI and rAAV2/6 vector clearance. Key exploratory endpoints include quality of life, Fabry symptoms and neuropathic pain scores; and immune response to AAV6 capsid and α‑Gal A.
•As of the November 9, 2021 cutoff date, five patients, ranging in age from 22 to 48 years, were treated with isaralgagene civaparvovec. Two patients were treated in Cohort 1 at the dose of 0.5e13 vg/kg, two patients were dosed in Cohort 2 at the dose of 1e13 vg/kg and one patient was dosed in Cohort 3 at the dose of 3e13 vg/kg. As of the cutoff date, the first treated patients had been followed for at least 52 weeks and the most recently treated patient had been followed for three weeks. A sixth patient, the second patient in Cohort 3, was dosed following the cutoff date.
•As of the November 9, 2021 cutoff date, isaralgagene civaparvovec continued to be generally well tolerated across the three dose cohorts in the five treated patients. One patient each in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 exhibited treatment-related adverse events for a total of eleven events, which were all graded as mild (Grade 1). No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. Prophylactic steroids were not required per the study protocol, and as of the cutoff date, no patients had exhibited liver enzyme elevations necessitating steroid treatment. 
•Results of plasma α‑Gal A activity as of the cutoff date for the first four patients treated in the first two dose cohorts are shown in the figure below. All four patients exhibited above normal levels of α‑Gal A activity by week 12 following treatment through 25 weeks for the most recently treated patient and 52 weeks for the first two patients treated. α-Gal A activity ranged from a 3-fold to 15-fold increase above mean normal activity levels as of 
the last date of measurement. For the two patients on ERT, α‑Gal A activity measured at ERT trough was 15-fold above mean normal at week 52 (Cohort 1) and 10-fold above mean normal at week 25 (Cohort 2). Withdrawal from ERT has been completed for one of these patients and is planned for the other patient on ERT, based on the stability of their α‑Gal A activity following treatment. For the two ERT pseudo-naïve patients, α‑Gal A activity was 3-fold above mean normal at week 52 (Cohort 1) and 4-fold above mean normal at week 40 (Cohort 2). The first patient in Cohort 3 exhibited α‑Gal A activity within mean normal range by week 2. 
•In the one patient with the highest elevated levels pre-treatment, plasma lyso-Gb3 levels decreased by approximately 40% from baseline within ten weeks after dosing through week 36. The other three patients, with lower baseline levels of lyso-Gb3, maintained steady lyso-Gb3 levels through the cutoff date.
•Several of the patients reported subjective improvements in quality-of-life measures as of the cutoff date. Three of the five patients exhibited improvements in anhidrosis (inability to sweat) or hypohidrosis (reduced ability to sweat), a primary and common Fabry disease symptom. Cardiac MRI findings stabilized following treatment in two patients.
Phase 1/2 STAAR Study: Plasma α‑Gal A activity
Biomarker results are presented from the four patients in the first two dose cohorts (0.5e13 vg/kg and 1.0e13 vg/kg) as of the cutoff date of November 9, 2021.
(*) Fold change was calculated at last measured time point. α‑Gal A activity was measured using a 3-hour reaction time and presented in nmol/h/mL. For Patients 1 and 4 this was sampled at ERT trough. Normal range and mean were determined based on healthy male individuals.
(†) Patient was withdrawn from ERT at week 24.
The sixth patient in the STAAR study, who is the second patient in Cohort 3, was dosed after the cutoff date. We expect to provide updated data in the second half of 2022. Based on the Phase 1/2 data, we have initiated Phase 3 planning.
SAR445136 - Sickle Cell Disease 
In December 2021, we and Sanofi presented updated preliminary proof-of-concept clinical data from our Phase 1/2 PRECIZN‑1 study evaluating SAR445136, our ZF nuclease gene-edited cell therapy product candidate for the treatment of sickle cell disease. Nine patients were enrolled as of the data cutoff date of September 22, 2021. Of the eight patients who completed mobilization and apheresis as of the cutoff date, five achieved successful target yields of HSPCs whereas two patients failed to mobilize and one patient discontinued due to intercurrent cholangitis. Four of the five patients achieving successful target yields of HSPCs had been infused with SAR445136 as of the cutoff date. Baseline patient characteristics of these four patients are in Table 1 below. As of the September 22, 2021 cutoff date, the most recently treated patient in the PRECIZN‑1 Phase 1/2 study had been followed for 26 weeks and the longest-treated patient had been followed for 91 weeks. None of the four treated patients required blood transfusions post engraftment. Total hemoglobin stabilized by week 26 after treatment with SAR445136 in all four patients. Fetal hemoglobin level increased from 0.1-11% at screening to 14-39% by week 26 in all four patients and was 38% in the longest-treated patient at 91 weeks (see Figure 1 below). Percent F cells increased to 64-96% by 39 weeks of follow-up in all four patients, persisting at 99% in the patient with 91 weeks of follow-up. SAR445136 had on-target BCL11A gene modification (61-78%) in all four patients. As of the cutoff date, SAR445136 was generally well tolerated, and there were no adverse events assessed as related to SAR445136. Most adverse events reported in the screening, mobilization, apheresis and conditioning periods were SCD-related events. The investigator reported two serious adverse events of sickle cell anemia with a vaso‑occlusive crisis, or VOC, as related to plerixafor, and one serious adverse event of nausea as related to busulfan. Most adverse events reported after infusion of SAR445136 were related to busulfan. The investigator reported one serious adverse event of sickle cell anemia with a VOC nine months after infusion in one patient, and no other SCD‑related events were reported in the four patients post-infusion. See Figure 2 below for VOCs reported before and after infusion of SAR445136. Additional data from this study are expected to be presented at a medical meeting in 2022.

We expect that the next four patients treated in the study will be dosed with a product candidate manufactured using improved methods, which has been shown in internal experiments to increase long-term progenitor cells. We expect to complete dosing of these patients in the third quarter of this year.
In January 2022, we announced that Sanofi will be transitioning its rights and obligations related to SAR445136 to us as of June 28, 2022. This transition follows Sanofi’s notice of termination for convenience of the collaboration and license agreement between Sanofi and Sangamo to develop genomic medicines for hemoglobinopathies. Sanofi has elected to transition the SAR445136 program to us following a recent change in Sanofi’s strategic direction to focus on allogeneic universal genomic medicine approaches rather than autologous personalized cell therapies. We and Sanofi are collaborating on an orderly transition, while we explore options to advance the program, including seeking a potential new collaboration partner. We expect the Phase 1/2 PRECIZN‑1 study of SAR445136 to be completed as planned and that Sanofi will continue to pay the costs of the Phase 1/2 PRECIZN‑1 study until the termination date of June 28, 2022, as contemplated by the collaboration and license agreement.
TX200 – HLA-A2 Mismatched Kidney Transplant Rejection
We have enrolled the first patient into our Phase 1/2 STEADFAST clinical study evaluating TX200, our wholly owned autologous CAR-Treg cell therapy product candidate to prevent immune-mediated rejection in HLA‑A2 mismatched kidney transplantation from a living donor, and we expect to dose this patient soon. We expect to dose the second patient in this study by the middle of 2022. We continue to open study sites and screen patients.
Giroctocogene Fitelparvovec - Hemophilia A
In December 2021, we and Pfizer presented updated follow-up data from the Phase 1/2 Alta study of giroctocogene fitelparvovec, our investigational gene therapy for the treatment of moderately severe to severe hemophilia A. Eleven male patients participated in the study overall, with five patients in the 3e13-vg/kg highest dose cohort. See Table 1 below for baseline patient demographics. As of the October 1, 2021 cutoff date, all five patients in the highest dose cohort had completed at least 104 weeks of follow-up. The results showed that, at 104 weeks, the five patients in the high dose cohort had mean factor VIII, or FVIII, activity of 25.4% of normal as measured by chromogenic clotting assay at the central laboratory. Maintenance of FVIII activity in the mild range (>5%) or greater improves outcomes for patients with severe hemophilia A. 
In the highest dose cohort, mean annualized bleeding rate, or ABR, was zero in the first year post-infusion and was 1.4 throughout the total duration of follow-up as of the cutoff date. In this highest dose cohort, two patients experienced bleeding events necessitating treatment with exogenous FVIII, all occurring after week 69 post-infusion: one patient experienced 8 bleeding events (5 traumatic, 2 spontaneous, 1 unknown) and one patient experienced one bleeding event in a target joint, circumstances unknown. No participants in the highest dose cohort have resumed prophylaxis as of the cutoff date. 
As of the October 1, 2021 cutoff date, six of the eleven patients had experienced treatment-related adverse events, including four of the five patients in the highest dose cohort. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events included elevated liver enzymes and infusion-related reactions: increased alanine aminotransferase, or ALT (5/11 (45.5%) overall; 3/5 (60.0%) in the highest dose cohort), increased aspartate aminotransferase, or AST (3/11 (27.3%) overall; 2/5 (40.0%) in the highest dose cohort), pyrexia (3/11 (27.3%) overall; 3/5 (60.0%) in the highest dose cohort), and tachycardia (2/11 (18.2%) overall; 2/5 (40.0%) in the highest dose cohort). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in one patient in the highest dose cohort who experienced grade 3 hypotension and fever with onset approximately six hours after giroctocogene fitelparvovec infusion; the events fully resolved with treatment and did not delay post-infusion discharge the next day. See Table 2 below for more details on treatment-related adverse events. Additionally, as of the cutoff date, no confirmed FVIII inhibitor development occurred, and no thrombotic events, neoplastic events, abnormal alfa-fetoprotein and/or liver masses were reported. Additional follow-up is required to assess durability of therapeutic effect and other long-term effects of giroctocogene fitelparvovec, such as impact on overall patient liver health.

In November 2021, following the observation of FVIII levels greater than 150% in some treated patients, we and Pfizer announced that Pfizer voluntarily paused screening and dosing of additional patients in the Phase 3 AFFINE clinical trial of giroctocogene fitelparvovec to implement a protocol amendment to provide clinical management guidance for elevated FVIII levels. Subsequently, on November 3, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, informed Pfizer that this trial had been placed on clinical hold while the protocol amendment and associated documents are reviewed. 
Pfizer has announced that it is in the process of submitting the protocol amendment and associated documents to health authorities in the countries where the trial is being conducted and preparing responses to the FDA clinical hold, and in February 2022, Pfizer announced that it hopes to obtain agreements to resume the AFFINE trial and to begin to reopen trial sites in the first half of 2022. 
AFFINE is a global Phase 3, open-label, multicenter, single arm trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a single infusion of giroctocogene fitelparvovec in more than 60 adult (ages 18-64 years) male patients with moderately severe to severe hemophilia A. The primary endpoint is impact on ABR through 12 months following treatment with giroctocogene fitelparvovec, compared to ABR on FVIII replacement therapy collected in the Phase 3 lead-in study period. The Phase 3 study is over 50% enrolled, and enrollment in the Phase 3 lead-in study is completed. We and Pfizer anticipate pivotal data readouts for this trial to be based on a full analysis of all study participants, when the first 50 patients are twelve months past reaching a steady-state of FVIII expression. We have the potential to earn up to $245 million in future milestone payments plus tiered royalties of 14%-20% on potential future product sales.
OUR TECHNOLOGY
Our strategy is to translate our differentiated and versatile ZF technology platform to create product-candidates with best- or first-in-class clinical potential. We believe that the versatility and flexibility of our technology platforms enable us to design therapeutic approaches to resolve the underlying genetic or cellular causes of disease, using whichever technology is best suited to deliver that treatment. Our current innovative areas of focus in preclinical studies include genome regulation with our ZF technology platform in the central nervous system, or CNS, diseases and CAR-Treg cell therapy for autoimmune diseases.
ZFPs: Naturally Occurring Sequence Specific DNA Binding Proteins in Humans
ZFPs are naturally-occurring sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins in humans that recognize and bind to a specific DNA sequence within or near a particular gene and causes expression of that gene to be “turned on” (activated) or “turned off” (repressed). ZFPs are the most common class of such naturally-occurring proteins in a wide range of organisms from yeast to humans. Functional domains may be added to ZFPs that enable genome editing (with enzymes such as nucleases or integrases) or genome regulation (with activators and repressors) at a specific genomic site determined by the ZFP DNA‑binding domain.
Figure 1: Schematic of the two-domain structure of a zinc finger DNA-binding domain and its functional domain 
Consistent with the structure of natural ZFPs, we take a modular approach to the design of the proteins that we engineer. The DNA-recognition part of our engineered proteins is typically composed of four to six zinc fingers. Each individual finger recognizes and binds to a three or four base-pair sequence of DNA and multiple fingers can be linked together to form a zinc finger array that recognizes longer stretches of DNA, thereby improving specificity. By modifying the amino acid sequence of ZFPs, we can engineer novel zinc finger arrays capable of recognizing the unique DNA sequences of a chosen genomic target.
Figure 2: Schematic of a ZFP and a zinc finger array composed of 6 ZFPs
The engineered DNA-binding zinc finger array is then linked to a functional domain. The DNA-binding zinc finger array brings this functional domain to the target of interest. Our ability to use our highly specific ZFPs to precisely target a DNA sequence to a gene of interest provides us with a range of genome editing and genome regulation functionalities that can be applied to multiple cell types.
Figure 3: Examples of genome engineering tools that can be offered by our ZF platform
Our engineered zinc fingers can be attached to a cleavage domain of a restriction endonuclease, an enzyme that cuts DNA, creating a ZF nuclease. When a pair of ZF nucleases binds DNA in the correct orientation and spacing, a cut is introduced into the DNA sequence between the ZF binding sites. DNA binding by both ZF nucleases is necessary for cleavage, and the two halves of the endonuclease must be present in the correct orientation to interact with one another in order to mediate DNA cleavage. This break in the DNA triggers a natural process of DNA repair within the cell. This endogenous DNA repair process may be harnessed to achieve one of several outcomes that may be therapeutically useful (Figure 2). If cells are treated with ZF nucleases alone, the repair process joins the two ends of the broken DNA together and frequently results in the 
loss (deletion) or addition (insertion) of a small amount of genetic material at the site of the break. These insertions and deletion events are collectively known as “indels.” These disrupt the target DNA sequence and result in the expression of a truncated or non-functional protein from the targeted gene, effectively “knocking out” the gene function. ZF nuclease-mediated genome editing can be used to disrupt genes that are involved in disease pathology. We are using ZF nuclease-mediated genome editing of the BCL11A erythroid specific enhancer, or ESE, in hematopoietic stem progenitor cells, or HSPCs, as the basis of a potential long-lasting and once only treatment for SCD (SAR445136).
In contrast, if cells with a mutation in a particular gene are treated not only with ZF nucleases, but also with an additional DNA sequence that encodes the correct gene sequence (referred to as a “donor” DNA) and with ZF nucleases that recognize and bind to sequences flanking the mutation, the cell’s repair machinery can use the donor DNA as a template to correct the mutated gene. This ZF nucleases-mediated gene correction enables the corrected gene to be expressed in its natural chromosomal context and may provide a novel approach for the precise repair of DNA sequence mutations responsible for certain monogenic diseases. In addition to providing a donor sequence that encodes a complete gene, a new copy of a gene can also be precisely added into the genome at a specific location. The ability to precisely place a gene-sized segment of DNA specifically into a pre-determined location in the genome broadens the range of mutations of a gene that can be corrected in a single step. It also reduces the insertional mutagenesis concerns associated with traditional integrating gene replacement approaches such as lentiviruses, in which the insertion of a new corrective copy of the gene typically occurs at random locations in the genome.
We are also evaluating ZF transcription factors, which have the potential to regulate the expression of a target gene (Figure 4). For instance, coupling an activation domain to a zinc finger will cause a target gene to be expressed at increased levels, relative to an untreated cell. Alternatively, a repression domain causes the gene to be downregulated or completely turned off. ZF transcription factors can also be designed to selectively repress expression of a mutant allele while allowing for the expression of the healthy allele. We have several preclinical programs evaluating the potential of ZF transcription factors that have been designed to down regulate the expression of genes as potential treatments for CNS diseases, including a collaboration agreement with Biogen for tauopathies and Parkinson’s disease, a collaboration with Takeda, for Huntington’s disease and a collaboration with Pfizer for ALS. We also have a preclinical collaboration with Novartis evaluating the potential of ZF transcription factors to upregulate expression of genes as a potential treatment for autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability.

ZF Platform Provides Opportunity to Develop a New Class of Human Therapeutics
We believe that our ZF platform provides a unique and proprietary basis for a broad new class of drugs that have differentiated technical advantages over small-molecule drugs, protein pharmaceuticals, RNA-based therapeutics, conventional gene therapy approaches and other gene and genome editing platforms, potentially enabling us to develop therapies that address 
a broad range of unmet medical needs. We notably believe that our ZF genomic medicines have the potential to transform treatment strategies for severe diseases from symptom management to lasting cures.
We can generate highly specific ZF nucleases for genome editing and ZF transcription factors for genome regulation using a range of proprietary methods. We are developing delivery strategies to administer these therapeutics, including using mRNA, AAV, adenovirus, plasmid, lipid nanoparticles and direct injection into brain tissue or into the cerebrospinal fluid. As more genes and DNA sequences are linked to specific diseases, we believe that the clinical breadth and scope of our ZF therapeutic reagents will continue to expand.
CAR-Tregs Have Potential to Address Autoimmune and Inflammatory Diseases
A key area of focus in our preclinical pipeline is our CAR-Treg programs we are studying in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Tregs are a type of white blood cell and act as the key regulators of the immune system. Their natural role is to maintain immune homeostasis and prevent undesirable immune reactions to autoantigens (autoimmunity) or to antigens that are normally tolerated (food antigens, inhaled antigens, contact antigens and bacterial flora antigens). Tregs play the role of ‘peacekeepers’ containing other T cells before they become harmful to the organism, ensuring the immune system does not mistakenly attack healthy organs while still protecting the body from harm, e.g., from viruses and bacteria. 
We are genetically re-programming Tregs ex vivo to add a CAR to give Tregs the ability to target a specific protein, called an antigen. CAR-Tregs are thus re-programmed to recognize and accumulate in specific tissues where the antigen is being expressed and an immune-mediated disorder is occurring. Our preclinical research shows that CAR-Tregs can inhibit overactive immune cells within the body. Moreover, they have the potential to induce long-term immune tolerance – a state of non-reactivity by the immune system to a particular auto-antigen. We aim to develop therapies that can induce and restore immune tolerance to address a wide range of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
CARs are composed of three main parts (see Figure 5):
•The extracellular section is composed of a single chain variable fragment, or scFv, typically derived from a monoclonal antibody and designed to recognize the target antigen, and a spacer or hinge to add spatial flexibility. 
•The transmembrane domain anchors the CAR in the plasma membrane.
•The intracellular section, made of signaling and co-stimulatory domains, transmits an intracellular signal upon recognition of the antigen by the scFv.
Figure 5: Schematic of CAR-Treg cell recognizing antigen on tissue cell
We carefully select the CAR target antigen for each autoimmune or inflammatory indication. Our CAR-Treg cells are designed to be active only at the site of inflammation, ensuring specific and selective action. For instance, for a CNS disease such as MS, we want to make sure that the target antigen is localized in the CNS. The target antigen may in some instances be linked to the disease etiology. 
A major feature of Tregs is that they can act via multiple mechanisms to mediate suppression. Their mechanism of action can be mediated upon cell contact, through soluble factors, metabolism disruption and/or cytolysis.
•Following IV administration, CAR-Tregs are expected to migrate toward inflamed tissues due to Tregs’ natural ability to migrate towards inflammatory tissues.
•Subsequently, CAR-Treg are expected to bind to their specific antigen, leading to the proliferation and activation of CAR-Treg cells. 
•This activation is expected to allow Tregs to exert their natural anti-inflammatory and immuno-suppressive activities, acting through multiple molecular and cellular targets.
Figure 6: Expected mechanism of action of CAR-Tregs
Our most advanced CAR-Treg product candidate, TX200, is being studied for the prevention of immune-mediated rejection following HLA-A2 mismatched kidney transplantation from a living donor. TX200 is an autologous CAR-Treg cell therapy product candidate. An autologous cell therapy is made using cells from the same person as the recipient of the cells, as shown on Figure 7. 
Figure 7: Schematic of our autologous CAR-Treg approach
In TX200, the patient’s Tregs are collected before transplant, genetically engineered with a CAR, and then injected back into the same patient. As a result of this detailed process, we expect dosing of patients will occur several months after their enrollment. The CAR in TX200 is designed to recognize the HLA-A2 protein present on the transplanted kidney.
The first patient has been enrolled in our STEADFAST clinical study, which we expect will help us understand how CAR-Tregs work in humans and may provide broader proof of concept for genetically modified cell therapy using Tregs. 
We are convinced of the fundamental impact of our CAR-Treg approach and are initiating the next step with the goal of making the approach available to a larger group of patients. Accordingly, we are developing ZF nuclease-edited allogeneic Treg therapies. Allogeneic cell therapies are donor derived, made using cells from a different person to the recipient of the cells, as opposed to autologous cell therapies. We believe that allogeneic therapies are the future of cell therapy and will overcome the challenges of autologous approaches such as scale and manufacturing. If we are able to demonstrate proof‑of‑concept of autologous TX200, we anticipate follow-on allogeneic programs. There is tremendous potential from there to go into many other large autoimmune indications such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes.
Gene Therapy Introduces Genes into a Patient’s Cells to Treat Genetic Diseases
In the process of developing our ZFP technologies, we have refined our understanding of gene therapies. Gene therapy is the treatment of disease by delivery of a new gene into a patient’s cells to replace an incorrect or damaged gene. Most often, gene therapy works by introducing a corrected copy of a defective gene into the patient’s cells, without removing or modifying DNA. The goal of gene therapy is to treat, or potentially cure, a genetic disease by adding back a normal copy of the gene responsible for the disease.
In gene therapy, we can deliver a therapeutic gene by engineering a deactivated virus to deliver DNA for a human therapeutic protein rather than viral proteins. One virus that is commonly used in gene therapy is adeno-associated virus, or AAV. AAV is a naturally occurring virus that infects humans but is not known to cause disease. Engineered AAV has been used as a delivery method for gene therapy in many clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe and has been found thus far to be generally well-tolerated without major side effects. A gene encoding a therapeutic protein can be packaged into AAV and delivered to cells in tissues such as the liver, the eye, the brain or the heart. Once inside the cell, the gene is unpacked from the virus coat, or capsid, and can then enable that cell to make the therapeutic protein. AAV can be manufactured at a large enough scale for use as a human therapeutic.

Proprietary Programs
Isaralgagene civaparvovec - Fabry Disease 
Isaralgagene civaparvovec is our gene therapy product candidate being developed for the treatment of Fabry disease, a rare inherited metabolic disease. STAAR is an ongoing Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging clinical study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of a single infusion of isaralgagene civaparvovec in Fabry disease patients ≥ 18 years of age. Patients are infused intravenously with a single dose and followed for 52 weeks. A separate long-term follow-up study is underway to monitor the patients treated in this study for up to five years following treatment. The study design provides for at least two subjects to be dosed in each dose cohort, with a potential expansion in each cohort. Patients who are on stable enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, may withdraw ERT after treatment in a controlled and monitored fashion at the discretion of the patient and the investigator.
The dose escalation phase includes males with classic Fabry disease. The study is expected to be subsequently expanded to treat females, as well as patients with Fabry-associated cardiac or renal disease. The study’s primary endpoint is incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Additional safety evaluations include routine hematology, chemistry and liver tests; vital signs; electrocardiogram; echocardiogram; serial alpha-fetoprotein testing and magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, of liver to monitor for potential formation of any liver mass. Secondary endpoints include change from baseline at specific time 
points over the one-year study period in α‑Gal A activity, Gb3 and lyso‑Gb3 levels in plasma; frequency of ERT infusion; changes in renal function, cardiac function and left ventricular mass, measured by cardiac MRI and rAAV2/6 vector clearance. Key exploratory endpoints include quality of life, Fabry symptoms and neuropathic pain scores; and immune response to AAV6 capsid and α‑Gal A.
The goal of the study is to abrogate the need for ERT with a recombinant AAV2/6 vector encoding cDNA for human α‑Gal A, resulting in long-term expression of α‑Gal A. As a liver-directed gene therapy, isaralgagene civaparvovec is designed to be delivered by a one-time IV infusion that does not require any preconditioning regimen for patients. We believe isaralgagene civaparvovec has the potential to deliver efficacy with preserved renal function and reduced cardiac morbidity and neuropathy.

CAR-Treg Cell Therapy - TX200 - HLA-A2 Mismatched Kidney Transplant Rejection 
TX200 is our autologous HLA-A2 specific CAR-Treg cell therapy product candidate that we have developed for the prevention of immune mediated rejection following HLA-A2 mismatched renal transplantation. We are currently evaluating TX200 in our Phase 1/2 STEADFAST clinical study. We believe the STEADFAST study will be critical for our understanding of CAR-Treg pharmacology and biology in patients as well as establishing process development and manufacturing know-how. 
TX200 has been developed for patients with end-stage renal disease or ESRD, receiving a kidney transplant, where the recipient of the kidney is HLA-A2 negative and the donor is HLA-A2 positive. A kidney transplant is considered the best treatment option for ESRD, the last stage of chronic kidney disease, when a person’s kidneys are no longer working. HLA mismatch is the initial and most important barrier to successful transplantation after ABO blood types incompatibility, and approximately 21-26% of transplanted organs are HLA-A2 mismatched. In the case of an HLA-A2 positive kidney transplanted into an HLA-A2 negative patient, the recipient’s immune system can recognize this mismatch and, without long-term immunosuppressive medication, will attack the new kidney carrying the HLA-A2 protein, leading to graft rejection. A lifetime of immunosuppressive therapy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, including the development of systemic infection, malignancy and cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in this patient population. Therefore, the induction of immunological tolerance defined a stable and acceptable graft function without the need for immunosuppression remains a key priority in this field of medicine.
TX200 is composed of autologous Treg cells engineered to express an HLA-A2 CAR, allowing them to localize to the renal graft and activate upon recognition of the HLA-A2 antigen. We believe that TX200 has the potential to prevent kidney rejection by binding to the HLA-A2 positive kidney and inducing immune tolerance. 
Similar to other genetically engineered cell therapy approaches, patients undergo a leukapheresis procedure, from which their Treg cells are isolated and engineered then cryopreserved. The HLA-A2 negative patient subsequently undergoes transplantation surgery to receive a kidney from their HLA-A2 positive living donor. Following a recovery period, the transplant recipient receives their personalized TX200 drug candidate. As a result of this detailed process, we expect dosing of patients to occur several months after study initiation and patient enrollment.
Our goal is that TX200 establishes the foundation for a portfolio of CAR-Tregs for major autoimmune indications. We believe that allogeneic therapies are the future of cell therapy and will overcome the challenges of autologous approaches such as scale and manufacturing. If we are able to demonstrate proof-of-concept of autologous TX200, we will continue to advance our kidney transplant allogeneic program which is currently in preclinical development. 
For recent updates on TX200, please see Business Updates above.
CAR-Treg Cell Therapy - IBD 
We continue to advance preclinical development of our wholly-owned CAR-Treg program to treat IBD. IBD covers debilitating disorders that involve chronic inflammation of the digestive tract, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Our product candidate to treat IBD is composed of allogeneic Treg cells engineered to express a CAR designed to recognize an antigen relevant to IBD, so that it allows resulting CAR-Treg cells to localize and activate in the gut.
In October 2021, we presented the first preclinical data from our allogeneic IL23R-CAR-Treg product candidate in a poster at the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT) Annual Congress. In this poster, we discussed our choice for the CAR target and the selection of the CAR scFv (antigen-recognition part). We showed in vitro results demonstrating that our IL23R-CAR-Treg product candidate binds to IL23R, gets activated upon binding to IL23R, and then shows an efficient suppressive function. Our in vivo data in two IBD mouse models confirmed these findings, showing that our product-candidate migrates to the site of inflammation and becomes activated after target encounter, resulting in a significant improvement of the overall disease score. Overall, our data suggest that engineered IL23R-CAR-Tregs have the potential to be a promising product‑candidate for treating Crohn’s Disease. Furthermore, we believe their mode of action could also pave the way for treating other IBD and chronic autoimmune pathologies involving IL23R.
Our IL23R CAR-Treg candidate for Crohn's disease
CAR-Treg Cell Therapy - MS 
We continue to advance preclinical development of our wholly-owned CAR-Treg program to treat MS, an autoimmune disease of the CNS. Similar to our IBD program, our product candidate to treat MS is composed of allogeneic Treg cells engineered to express a CAR designed to recognize an antigen relevant to MS, so that resulting CAR-Tregs can localize and activate in the CNS.
Genome Engineering - Prion Disease
We continue to advance our wholly-owned preclinical genome engineering program in prion disease, a fatal and incurable neurodegenerative disease caused by the misfolding of the prion protein encoded by the gene PRNP.
Partnered Programs
SAR445136 - Sickle Cell Disease 
We and Sanofi are currently evaluating SAR445136, our ZF nuclease gene-edited cell therapy product candidate for SCD in the Phase 1/2 PRECIZN-1 study. 
SAR445136 involves genome editing of a patient’s own hematopoietic stem progenitor cells using non-viral delivery of our ZF nuclease technology designed to induce the synthesis of fetal hemoglobin. This is achieved by gene-edited knock out of the erythroid specific enhancer of the BCL11a gene, which encodes a strong repressor of the gamma globin gene. In SCD, increased fetal hemoglobin synthesis may provide the patient with functional hemoglobin and help downregulate the abnormal sickle hemoglobin that results in painful sickle cell crises and other disease feature.
Our ZF cell therapy approach to treat SCD
In January 2022, we announced that Sanofi will be transitioning its rights and obligations related to SAR445136 to us as of June 28, 2022. Sanofi has elected to transition the SCD program to us following a recent change in Sanofi’s strategic direction to focus on allogeneic universal genomic medicine approaches rather than autologous personalized cell therapies We and Sanofi are collaborating on an orderly transition, while we explore options to advance the program, including seeking a potential new collaboration partner. We expect the Phase 1/2 PRECIZN-1 study of SAR445136 to be completed as planned and that Sanofi will continue to pay the costs of the Phase 1/2 PRECIZN-1 study until the termination date of June 28, 2022, as contemplated by the collaboration and license agreement between Sangamo and Sanofi.
For recent updates on SAR445136, please see Business Updates above.
Giroctocogene Fitelparvovec - Hemophilia A
We and Pfizer continue to develop giroctocogene fitelparvovec, or SB-525, which is currently the subject of our registrational Phase 3 AFFINE clinical trial as an investigational gene therapy for moderately severe to severe hemophilia A. Under our collaboration agreement with Pfizer, we conducted the Phase 1/2 Alta clinical study and certain manufacturing activities, while Pfizer is responsible for subsequent worldwide development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization, including the Phase 3 AFFINE clinical trial.
AFFINE is a global Phase 3, open-label, multicenter, single arm trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a single infusion of giroctocogene fitelparvovec in more than 60 adult (ages 18-64 years) male patients with moderately severe to severe hemophilia A. The primary endpoint is impact on annual bleed rate, or ABR, through 12 months following treatment with giroctocogene fitelparvovec, compared to ABR on FVIII replacement therapy collected in the Phase 3 lead-in study period. The Phase 3 study is over 50% enrolled, and enrollment in the Phase 3 lead-in study is completed.
Based on initial results from the Alta study, the FDA granted regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation to giroctocogene fitelparvovec. RMAT designation is granted to regenerative medicine therapies intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious condition, for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the medicine has the potential to address an unmet medical need. The RMAT designation includes all the benefits of the fast track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with the FDA. The FDA also granted giroctocogene fitelparvovec Orphan Drug and Fast Track designation, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted it Orphan Medicinal Product designation.
For recent updates on giroctocogene fitelparvovec, please see Business Updates above.
KITE-037 - Cancer 
We and Kite Pharma, Inc., or Kite, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead Sciences, Inc., continue to develop cell therapies to treat cancer using our research to design ZF nucleases and viral vectors to disrupt and insert select genes in T cells and natural killer cells, or NK-cells, including the insertion of genes that encode CARs, T cell receptors, or TCRs, and NK-cell receptors, or NKRs, directed to mutually agreed targets. Kite is responsible for all clinical development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization. In May 2021, we announced that as part of their recent portfolio review, Kite made a decision not to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, for KITE-037 at that time. The development program for KITE-037 remains active, and we and Kite are working closely towards the development of one or more new product candidates.
ST-501 - Tauopathies, ST-502 - Synucleinopathies and Type 1 Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1) 
We and Biogen continue to develop preclinical genome engineering therapies, including our ST-501 product candidate to treat tauopathies, our ST-502 product candidate to treat synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease and a product candidate targeting DM1, a neuromuscular disease. Biogen has also selected an undisclosed fourth neurological disease gene target under our collaboration agreement, and we have begun early research activities on therapies addressing this target. Under our collaboration agreement with Biogen, it has exclusive rights to nominate up to eight additional targets over a target selection period of five years. This collaboration leverages ZF transcription factors to aim to modulate the expression of key genes involved in neurological diseases.
In March 2021, we published preclinical data in Science Advances, showing that tau-targeted ZF-transcription factors selectively reduced tau messenger RNA and proteins by 50% to 80% out to 11 months without detectable off-target events. 
In the first half of 2021, we presented preclinical data at the 15th International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases (AD/PD) and at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Annual Meeting, showing that alpha synuclein-targeted ZF-transcription factors could significantly repress human alpha synuclein and were well tolerated in vivo.
Genome Engineering - Autism Spectrum Disorder and Neurodevelopmental Disorders
 We and Novartis continue to develop preclinical genome engineering therapies for three neurodevelopmental targets, including genes linked to autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. The collaboration leverages our ZF‑transcription factors to aim to upregulate the expression of key genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders.
Genome Engineering - ALS and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration
We and Pfizer continue to develop preclinical genome engineering product candidates that use allele-specific ZF‑transcription factors to treat ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, or FTLD, linked to mutations in the C9ORF72 gene. The most frequent genetic cause of ALS is the expansion of hexanucleotide repeats, or G4C2 repeats, in the first intron of the C9ORF72 gene. Our approach is to design ZF‑transcription factors to repress specifically pathogenic gene expression from the disease allele, while preserving expression of the healthy allele. 
In September 2020, we completed our research obligations associated with this collaboration, which required us to identify, characterize and preclinically develop ZF‑transcription factors satisfying pre-agreed criteria. Pfizer is now responsible for subsequent research and development activities as well as subsequent development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization.
In May 2021, we presented preclinical data at the ASGCT Annual Meeting, showing that ZF‑transcription factors were capable of selectively repressing the expression of both disease sense and antisense isoforms over a wide dose range while preserving the expression of normal isoform in patient‑derived neural cells. No detectable off-target gene regulation was observed.
Takeda – Huntington’s Disease 
We and Takeda continue to develop potential preclinical genome engineering product candidates to treat Huntington’s Disease that use a ZF-transcription factor designed to differentially down regulate the mutated disease-causing huntingtin gene, or HTT gene, while preserving the expression of the normal version of the gene.
 For more information on the collaborations underlying these partnered programs, see “—Collaborations” below.
Legacy Clinical Research Programs
We have stopped development of the following clinical research programs. We continue to perform the appropriate long-term follow-up and closeout activities of the legacy studies in accordance with the study protocols.
ST-400 - Beta Thalassemia 
In November 2021, we and Sanofi announced that we made a business decision to cease development of the beta thalassemia indication in order to focus resources on the sickle cell disease program. Five patients were dosed in the Phase 1/2 Thales study, an open-label, single arm clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ST-400. Results were last presented at American Society for Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition 2021. 
SB-728 - Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV
SB-728 was one of the first clinical candidates to use an early generation of our ZF nuclease-mediated genome editing technology. We conducted several clinical studies evaluating SB-728, demonstrating the safety of the platform and showing immune responses from a subset of patients, however the studies did not meet our clinical expectations and we have stopped development in HIV.
SB-913 - MPS II
In January 2021, we announced that we have stopped development of SB-913, our ZF nuclease genome editing product candidate for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II, or MPS II. While the Phase 1/2 CHAMPIONS study evaluating SB-913 demonstrated the first molecular evidence of genome editing, the study did not meet our clinical expectations. Research is ongoing to improve the potency and delivery of our ZF nuclease for genome editing, which we believe will optimize the platform for therapeutic effect. 
SB-318 - MPS I and SB-FIX - Hemophilia B
We have stopped development of SB-318 and SB-FIX, genome editing product candidates for the treatment of MPS I and hemophilia B, respectively.
COLLABORATIONS
We have entered into strategic collaborations with larger biopharmaceutical companies for several of our therapeutic programs and other partnerships for several non-therapeutic applications of our technology. We will continue to pursue further collaborations when appropriate to fund internal research and development activities and to assist in product development, manufacturing, regulatory approval and commercialization. Decisions to collaborate or not will be based on review of our internal resources, institutional knowledge and commercial considerations.
Novartis
In July 2020, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Novartis for the research, development and commercialization of gene regulation therapies to treat three neurodevelopmental disorders. Under the agreement, we granted to Novartis an exclusive, royalty bearing and worldwide license, under our relevant patents and know-how, to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain of our ZF-transcription factors targeted to three undisclosed genes that are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. We perform early research activities over the collaboration period for each gene target and manufacture the ZF-transcription factors required for such research, costs of which are funded by Novartis. Novartis is responsible for additional research activities, IND-enabling studies, clinical development, regulatory approvals, manufacturing of preclinical, clinical and approved products, and global commercialization. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the agreement, we are prohibited from developing, manufacturing or commercializing any therapeutic product targeting any of the three genes that are the subject of the collaboration. Novartis also has the option to license certain of our proprietary AAVs for the sole purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing licensed products arising from the collaboration. 
Under the agreement, Novartis paid us a $75.0 million upfront license fee payment in August 2020. In addition, we are eligible to earn from Novartis up to $420.0 million in development milestones and up to $300.0 million in commercial 
milestones. We are also eligible to earn from Novartis tiered high single-digit to sub-teen double-digit royalties on potential net commercial sales of licensed products arising from the collaboration. These royalty payments are subject to reduction due to patent expiration, loss of market exclusivity and payments made under certain licenses for third-party intellectual property. The agreement continues, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the expiration of the applicable royalty term. Novartis has the right to terminate the agreement, in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis, for any reason after a specified notice period. Each party has the right to terminate the agreement on account of the other party’s bankruptcy or material, uncured breach.
Biogen
In February 2020, we entered into a global licensing collaboration agreement with Biogen for the research, development and commercialization of gene regulation therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases which became effective in April 2020. Our collaboration aims to leverage our proprietary ZFP technology delivered via AAV to modulate expression of key genes involved in neurological diseases. Concurrently with the execution of the collaboration agreement, we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Biogen MA, Inc., pursuant to which Biogen MA, Inc. purchased 24,420,157 shares of our common stock, or the Biogen Shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $225.0 million.
Under the collaboration agreement, Biogen paid us an upfront license fee payment of $125.0 million. We are also eligible to earn research, development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments that could total up to approximately $2.4 billion if Biogen selects all of the targets allowed under the agreement and all the specified milestones set forth in the agreement are achieved, which includes up to $925.0 million in pre-approval milestone payments and up to $1.5 billion in first commercial sale and other sales-based milestone payments. In addition, we are also eligible to receive tiered high single-digit to sub-teen royalties on potential net commercial sales of licensed products arising from the collaboration. These royalty payments are subject to reduction due to patent expiration, entry of biosimilar products to the market and payments made under certain licenses for third-party intellectual property.
Under the collaboration agreement, we granted to Biogen an exclusive, royalty bearing and worldwide license, under our relevant patents and know-how, to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain ZFP and/or AAV-based products directed to up to twelve neurological disease gene targets selected by Biogen. Biogen has already selected four of these: our ST-501 product candidate to treat tauopathies, our ST-502 product candidate to treat synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease, a third product candidate targeting DM1, a neuromuscular disease, and a fourth undisclosed neurological disease gene target. Biogen has exclusive rights to nominate up to eight additional targets over a target selection period of five years. For each gene target selected by Biogen, we perform early research activities, costs for which are shared by the companies, aimed at the development of the combination of proprietary CNS delivery vectors and ZF-transcription factors targeting therapeutically relevant genes. Biogen then assumes responsibility and costs for the IND-enabling studies, clinical development, related regulatory interactions, and global commercialization. We are primarily responsible for Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, manufacturing activities for the initial clinical studies for the first three products of the collaboration and plan to leverage our in-house manufacturing capacity. Biogen is responsible for GMP manufacturing activities beyond the first clinical study for each of the first three products. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the collaboration agreement, we are prohibited from developing, manufacturing or commercializing any therapeutic product directed to the targets selected by Biogen.
The collaboration agreement continues, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the expiration of the applicable royalty term. Biogen has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement, in its entirety or on target-by-target basis, for any reason after a specified notice period. Each party has the right to terminate this agreement on account of the other party’s bankruptcy or material, uncured breach. In addition, we may terminate the collaboration agreement if Biogen challenges any patents licensed by us to Biogen. 
Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, Biogen has agreed not to, without our prior written and subject to specified conditions and exceptions, directly or indirectly acquire shares of our outstanding common stock, seek or propose a tender or exchange offer or merger between the parties, solicit proxies or consents with respect to any matter, or undertake other specified actions related to the potential acquisition of additional equity interests in us. Subject to customary exceptions, such standstill restrictions expire on the earlier of the three-year anniversary of the effectiveness of the Biogen collaboration agreement and the date that Biogen beneficially owns less than 5% of our common stock.
The stock purchase agreement also provides that until the first anniversary of the effectiveness of the Biogen collaboration agreement, Biogen must hold and not sell any of the Biogen Shares and from the first anniversary through the second anniversary, Biogen must hold and not sell at least 50% of the Biogen Shares, in addition to being subject to certain volume limitations. The stock purchase agreement further provides that, subject to certain limitations, upon Biogen’s request, we must register for resale any of the Biogen Shares on a registration statement to be filed with the SEC, until such time as all remaining Biogen Shares may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act during any 90-day period.
In addition, Biogen has agreed that, excluding specified extraordinary matters, it must vote the Biogen Shares in accordance with our recommendation and has granted us an irrevocable proxy with respect to the foregoing. Such voting provisions expire on the earlier of (i) the two-year anniversary of the effectiveness of the Biogen collaboration agreement, (ii) the date that Biogen beneficially owns less than 5% of our common stock and (iii) the date the Biogen collaboration agreement is terminated; provided, however, that in no event shall such expiration date be prior to the one-year anniversary of the effectiveness of the Biogen collaboration agreement.
Kite 
In February 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Kite, which became effective in April 2018 and was amended and restated in September 2019, for the research, development and commercialization of engineered cell therapies for cancer. Kite is responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of any resulting products.
Subject to the terms of this agreement, we granted Kite an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide, sublicensable license, under our relevant patents and know-how, to develop, manufacture and commercialize, for the purpose of treating cancer, specific cell therapy products that may result from the research program and that are engineered ex vivo using selected ZF nuclease and AAVs developed under the research program, to express CARs, TCRs or NKRs directed to candidate targets.
During the research program term and subject to certain exceptions, except pursuant to this agreement, we are prohibited from researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing, for the purpose of treating cancer, any cell therapy product that, as a result of ex vivo genome editing, expresses a CAR, TCR or NKR that is directed to a target expressed on or in a human cancer cell. After the research program term concludes and subject to certain exceptions, except pursuant to this agreement, we are prohibited from developing, manufacturing and commercializing, for the purpose of treating cancer, any cell therapy product that, as a result of ex vivo genome editing, expresses a CAR, TCR or NKR that is directed to a candidate target.
We received a $150.0 million upfront payment from Kite when the agreement became effective in April 2018. In addition, Kite reimburses our direct costs to conduct the joint research program, and Kite is responsible for all subsequent development, manufacturing and commercialization of any licensed products. We are also eligible to earn contingent development- and sales-based milestone payments that could total up to $3.0 billion if all the specified milestones set forth in this agreement are achieved. Of this amount, approximately $1.3 billion relates to the achievement of specified research, clinical development, regulatory and first commercial sale milestones, and approximately $1.8 billion relates to the achievement of specified sales-based milestones if annual worldwide net sales of licensed products reach specified levels. Each development- and sales-based milestone payment is payable (i) only once for each licensed product, regardless of the number of times that the associated milestone event is achieved by such licensed product, and (ii) only for the first 10 times that the associated milestone event is achieved, regardless of the number of licensed products that may achieve such milestone event. In addition, we are entitled to receive escalating, tiered royalty payments with a percentage in the single digits based on potential future annual worldwide net sales of licensed products. These royalty payments are subject to reduction due to patent expiration, entry of biosimilar products to the market and payments made under certain licenses for third-party intellectual property.
Kite has the right to terminate this agreement, in its entirety or on a per licensed product or per candidate target basis, for any reason after a specified notice period. Each party has the right to terminate this agreement on account of the other party’s bankruptcy or material, uncured breach.
Pfizer
We have two separate collaboration agreements with Pfizer:
Giroctocogene Fitelparvovec Collaboration
 In May 2017, we entered into an exclusive, global collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer for the research, development and commercialization of giroctocogene fitelparvovec, also known as SB-525, our gene therapy product candidate for hemophilia A, and closely related products, which we amended in December 2019.
Under this agreement, we were responsible for conducting the Phase 1/2 clinical study and certain manufacturing activities for giroctocogene fitelparvovec, while Pfizer is responsible for subsequent worldwide development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of giroctocogene fitelparvovec. We may also collaborate in the research and development of additional AAV-based gene therapy products for hemophilia A.
We received an upfront license fee of $70.0 million, achieved a $25.0 million milestone in December 2019 upon completion of the transfer of the IND for giroctocogene fitelparvovec to Pfizer, and achieved a $30.0 million milestone in October 2020 upon the dosing of the first patient in our pivotal Phase 3 AFFINE trial. We are eligible to earn further 
development milestone payments on the achievement of specified clinical development, intellectual property, regulatory and first commercial sale milestones for giroctocogene fitelparvovec and potentially other products. The total amount of potential clinical development, intellectual property, regulatory, and first commercial sale milestone payments, assuming the achievement of all specified milestones in this agreement, is $475.0 million, which includes up to $300.0 million for giroctocogene fitelparvovec and up to $175.0 million for other products that may be developed under the agreement, subject to reduction on account of payments made under certain licenses for third‑party intellectual property. In addition, Pfizer agreed to pay us royalties for each potential licensed product developed under the agreement that are an escalating tiered, double-digit percentage of the annual net sales of such product and are subject to reduction due to patent expiration, entry of biosimilar products to the market and payment made under certain licenses for third‑party intellectual property.
Subject to the terms of the agreement, we granted Pfizer an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use certain technology controlled by us for the purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing giroctocogene fitelparvovec and related products. Pfizer granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free, fully paid license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use certain manufacturing technology developed under the agreement and controlled by Pfizer to manufacture our products that utilize the AAV delivery system. During a specified period, neither we nor Pfizer are permitted to clinically develop or commercialize, outside of the collaboration, certain AAV-based gene therapy products for hemophilia A.
Unless earlier terminated, the agreement has a term that continues, on a per product and per country basis, until the later of (i) the expiration of patent claims that cover the product in a country, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for a product in a country, and (iii) 15 years after the first commercial sale of a product in a country. Pfizer has the right to terminate the agreement without cause in its entirety or on a per product or per country basis. The agreement may also be terminated by either party based on an uncured material breach by the other party or the bankruptcy of the other party. Upon termination for any reason, the license granted by us to Pfizer to develop, manufacture and commercialize giroctocogene fitelparvovec and related products automatically terminate. Upon termination by us for cause or by Pfizer in any country or countries, Pfizer is required to automatically grant us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain technology controlled by Pfizer to develop, manufacture and commercialize giroctocogene fitelparvovec in the terminated country or countries.
C9ORF72 Collaboration
In December 2017, we entered into a separate exclusive, global collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of potential gene therapy products that use ZF-transcription factors to treat ALS and FTLD linked to mutations of the C9ORF72 gene. Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to work with Pfizer on a research program to identify, characterize and preclinically develop ZF-transcription factors that bind to and specifically reduce expression of the mutant form of the C9ORF72 gene.
We received a $12.0 million upfront payment from Pfizer and achieved a $5.0 million milestone payment in September 2020 associated with the completion of all of our research activities for the C9ORF72 collaboration. We are eligible to earn up to $60.0 million in development milestone payments from Pfizer contingent on the achievement of specified preclinical development, clinical development and first commercial sale milestones, and up to $90.0 million commercial milestone payments if annual worldwide net sales of the licensed products reach specified levels. In addition, Pfizer will pay us royalties based on an escalating tiered, mid- to high-single digit percentage of the annual worldwide net sales of the licensed products. These royalty payments are subject to reduction due to patent expiration, entry of biosimilar products to the market and payments made under certain licenses for third‑party intellectual property. Each party is responsible for the cost of its performance of the research program. Pfizer is operationally and financially responsible for subsequent development, manufacturing and commercialization of the licensed products.
Subject to the terms of the agreement, we granted Pfizer an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, license under our relevant patents and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize gene therapy products that use resulting ZF-transcription factors that satisfy pre-agreed criteria. During a specified period, neither we nor Pfizer will be permitted to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize outside of the collaboration any ZFPs that specifically bind to the C9ORF72 gene.
Unless earlier terminated, the agreement has a term that continues, on a per licensed product and per country basis, until the later of (i) the expiration of patent claims that cover the licensed product in a country, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for a licensed product in a country, and (iii) 15 years after the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a major market country. Pfizer has the right to terminate the agreement without cause in its entirety or on a per product or per country basis. The agreement may also be terminated by either party based on an uncured material breach by the other party or the bankruptcy of the other party. The agreement will also terminate if we are unable to identify any lead candidates for development within a specified period of time or if Pfizer elects not to advance a lead candidate beyond a certain development milestone within a specified period of time. Upon termination for any reason, the license granted by us to Pfizer to develop, manufacture and commercialize licensed products under the agreement will automatically terminate. Upon termination by us for cause or by Pfizer without cause for any licensed product or licensed products in any country or countries, we will have the right to negotiate with Pfizer to obtain a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain technology controlled by Pfizer to develop, manufacture and commercialize the licensed product or licensed products in the terminated country or countries. 
Following termination by us for Pfizer’s material breach, either party will not be permitted to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize ZFPs that specifically bind to the C9ORF72 gene for a period of time.
Sanofi
In January 2014, we entered into an exclusive worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Biogen MA, Inc., who subsequently assigned it to Bioverativ Inc., who was then subsequently acquired by Sanofi to develop therapeutics for hemoglobinopathies. Under the agreement, we were originally jointly conducting two research programs: a beta thalassemia program, which was discontinued in the third quarter of 2021, and a program which resulted in the development of SAR445136, a ZF nuclease, gene-edited cell therapy product candidate for the treatment of SCD, which remains active. 
Under the SCD program, we and Sanofi were jointly responsible for research and development activities prior to filing of an IND, but Sanofi is now responsible for subsequent worldwide clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of licensed products developed under the agreement. Subject to the terms of the agreement, we have granted Sanofi an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use certain ZFP and other technology controlled by us for the purpose of researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing licensed products developed under the agreement. We have also granted Sanofi a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under our interest in certain other intellectual property developed pursuant to the agreement. During the term of the agreement, we are not permitted to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize, outside of the agreement, certain gene therapy products that target genes relevant to the licensed products.
Under the agreement, we received an upfront license fee of $20.0 million, achieved a $6.0 million milestone in August 2019 upon dosing of the third subject in the beta thalassemia Phase 1/2 clinical trial and achieved a $7.5 million milestone in December 2019 upon dosing of the first subject in the Phase 1/2 PRECIZN‑1 clinical study evaluating SAR445136. 
In January 2022, we announced that Sanofi will be transitioning its rights and obligations related to SAR445136 to us as of June 28, 2022. This transition follows Sanofi’s notice of termination for convenience of the collaboration and license agreement between Sanofi and Sangamo. Sanofi has elected to transition the SAR445136 program to us following a recent change in Sanofi’s strategic direction to focus on allogeneic universal genomic medicine approaches rather than autologous personalized cell therapies. We and Sanofi are collaborating on an orderly transition, while we explore options to advance the program, including seeking a potential new collaboration partner. We expect the Phase 1/2 PRECIZN‑1 study of SAR445136 to be completed as planned and that Sanofi will continue to pay the costs of the Phase 1/2 PRECIZN‑1 study until the termination date of June 28, 2022, as contemplated by the collaboration and license agreement
Takeda
In January 2012, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Shire International GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda, which we amended and restated in September 2015, to research, develop and commercialize human therapeutics and diagnostics for monogenic diseases based on our ZFP technology. We received an upfront license fee of $13.0 million in 2012 and achieved a $1.0 million milestone in 2014. Pursuant to the amended and restated agreement, Takeda has an exclusive, worldwide license to ZFP therapeutics for treating Huntington’s disease.
Under the amended and restated agreement, Takeda has full control over, and full responsibility for the costs of, the Huntington’s disease program, subject to certain obligations, including the obligation to retain us to perform ZFP design, optimization and assessment services and to reimburse us for the costs of such services. Takeda does not have any milestone payment obligations but is required to pay single digit percentage royalties to us, up to a specified maximum cap, on the commercial sales of ZFP therapeutic products for Huntington’s disease. During the term of the amended and restated agreement, we are not permitted to research, develop or commercialize, outside of the agreement, certain products that target the HTT gene.
Under the amended and restated agreement, we have full control over, and full responsibility for the costs of, the hemophilia A and B programs returned to us by Takeda, subject to certain diligence obligations. We also granted Takeda a right of first negotiation to obtain a license to such programs under certain circumstances. We are required to pay single digit percentage royalties to Takeda, up to a specified maximum cap, on commercial sales of therapeutic products from the programs returned to us by Takeda. We will be required to pay Takeda this single digit percentage royalty, subject to the maximum royalty cap, on any commercial sales of giroctocogene fitelparvovec, our gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of moderately severe to severe hemophilia A that we are developing with our collaborator Pfizer, if giroctocogene fitelparvovec receives regulatory approvals and is commercialized.
The amended and restated agreement may be terminated by (i) us or Takeda, in whole or in part, for the uncured material breach of the other party, (ii) us or Takeda for the bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding of the other party and (iii) Takeda, in its entirety, effective upon at least 90 days’ advance written notice.
Other Partnerships
In addition to our partnerships for the development of human therapeutic applications, we have also licensed our technology in several other areas, such as plant agriculture and research reagents, including the production of transgenic animals and cell-line engineering. These license partners include Corteva AgriScience, formerly known as Dow AgroSciences LLC, or DAS, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (now MilliporeSigma in the United States and Merck KGaA outside the United States), Genentech, Inc., Open Monoclonal Technology, Inc. (now Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc.) and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
Patents, trade secrets, know-how and licensed technologies are important to our business. Our strategy includes filing, obtaining, maintaining, licensing, and when necessary, defending our patents and patent applications to protect technologies, inventions, and improvements to inventions that we consider important for the research, development, and commercialization of our technologies and our product candidates. We have filed numerous patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and with patent offices in multiple foreign jurisdictions. Our proprietary intellectual property includes methods relating to the design of zinc finger proteins, Transcription Activator-Like Effector, or TALE, proteins and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, or CRISPR/Cas, editing systems, therapeutic applications of genome editing technology, enabling technologies related to our platform and the use of genome editing across a variety of applications. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, proprietary know-how, continuing technological innovations and trade secret protections, as well as confidentiality agreements, materials transfer agreements, research agreements and licensing agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
In-licensed Technology
We have exclusively licensed in relevant fields certain intellectual property directed to the design, selection, and use of ZFPs, ZF nucleases and ZF-transcription factors for genome editing and genome regulation from numerous academic institutions. Although no individual in-license is material to our overall protection of our ZFP and ZF nuclease platforms, we believe that these in-licenses, in combination with our own know-how, patent applications and patents, protect us from unauthorized third parties who might try to copy or use our products or technologies.
In addition, with respect to our cell therapy products, our subsidiary, Sangamo France, has a license agreement with the University of British Columbia pursuant to which it exclusively licensed in relevant fields the right to the CAR for use in our TX200 product candidate. This license includes one patent family, which is expected to expire in September 2038, absent any patent term adjustment, or PTA, patent term extension, or PTE, or disclaimers.
Our Intellectual Property
In addition to our in-licensed patent portfolio, we have numerous issued patents and pending patent applications directed to the design, compositions and uses of ZFPs, ZF nucleases, ZF-transcription factors, TALE proteins and CRISPR/Cas editing systems and other technologies related to our programs.
Given our over two-decade history with zinc finger technology, some of the earliest zinc finger patents in our portfolio began expiring in 2015. However, we have continued to build on this patent portfolio and have been issued additional patents and have applications pending that provide protection for our ZFP technology. Additionally, patents that may be issued from our pending applications will extend the patent exclusivity of our patent estate.
We believe that our in-licensed and our owned patents and patent applications, in combination with our know-how and trade secrets, in the aggregate, will provide us with substantial protection of and exclusivity around the commercial development of our gene therapy, cell therapy and genome engineering programs. In this regard, patents issued to us, applied 
for by us, or exclusively and non-exclusively licensed to us, cover our commercially relevant technologies, including the following types of inventions, processes and products:
•ZFP and ZF nuclease design, engineered nucleases, and compositions (multiple patents issued with expected expiration dates ranging from 2029 to 2036), absent any PTA, PTE or disclaimers): These patents cover inventions including DNA target site selection, zinc finger binding domain design, nuclease domain design, linker design, DNA nickases, ZFP libraries databases and methods of construction, as well as methods to increase zinc finger binding specificity (see, e.g., US9982245, US10066242, US10113207);
•ZFP Therapeutics (multiple patents issued with expected expiration dates ranging from 2028 to 2031, absent any PTA, PTE or disclaimers): These patents cover inventions including methods relating to activation and inhibition of endogenous genes, identification of accessible regions within chromatin, including treatment of Huntington’s disease, HIV, cancer therapeutics, modulation of cardiac contractility and methods to regulate the glucocorticoid receptor (see, e.g., US9943565);
•Nuclease Therapeutics (multiple patents issued with expected expiration dates ranging from 2031 to 2036, absent any PTA, PTE or disclaimers): These patents cover inventions including treatments for HIV, beta thalassemia and SCD, hemophilia inherited metabolic diseases, genome editing, Parkinson’s Disease, regulation of the expression of PD1; Immunomodulatory therapeutics; Cystic Fibrosis; CNS disease; Severe combined immunodeficiency, Modified T cells, including HLA knock out and methods of editing stem cells (see, e.g., US9877988, US9963715, US10072066, US10081661, US10143760); and
•Non-Therapeutic Applications of ZFPs and Nucleases (multiple patents issued with expected expiration dates ranging from 2028 to 2035, absent any PTA, PTE or disclaimers): These patents cover inventions including identification of regulatory sequences, analysis of gene regulation, structure and biological function, methods of agricultural biotechnology, methods of altering cellular differentiation state, development of cell lines for improved protein production, methods of transgenic animal development, engineering of stem cells, methods of genome editing (see, e.g., US9890395).
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal tenets are largely unresolved and are subject to administrative, judicial, and regulatory interpretation and refinement. Obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing patent protection in the U.S. and other countries remains uncertain and depends, in part, upon decisions of the patent offices, courts, administrative bodies and lawmakers in these countries. It is also possible that we may develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are not patentable. Patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents and the coverage claimed in a patent application may be significantly reduced before a patent is issued. It is possible that, under certain circumstances, patent applications will be rejected and we subsequently abandon them. It is possible that we may decide that an issued patent or pending patent application may provide us with little or no competitive advantage in view of its associated costs, in which case we may abandon or allow to lapse such patent or patent applications. Although we have filed for patents on some aspects of our technology, we cannot provide assurances that patents will be issued as a result of these pending applications or that any patent that has been or may be issued will be upheld. It is possible that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may be successfully challenged, invalidated in whole or in part, or deemed unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.
Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.
Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have 
not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. Ultimately, patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.
Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In some countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be adversely affected. 
In the future, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. The outcome following any potential legal assertions of infringement, invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. Any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties, if determined adversely to us, could significantly harm our business. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
COMPETITION
We and our biopharmaceutical collaborators are leaders in the research and development of gene therapies, cell therapies and genome engineering therapies using ZFP DNA-binding proteins. 
We are aware of several other companies focused on other methods for editing genes and regulating gene expression and a limited number of commercial and academic groups pursuing the development of ZFP genome engineering technologies. The fields of gene therapy, cell therapy and genome engineering are highly competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future from a number of different sources, including other biopharmaceutical companies; academic and research institutions; and government agencies that will seek to develop ZFPs as well as technologies that will compete with our ZFP technology platform, such as TALE proteins and the CRISPR-Cas editing system.
Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA approval or commercializing competitive products before we do. If we commence commercial product sales, we may be competing against companies with greater marketing, sales, distribution and manufacturing capabilities, areas in which we have limited or no experience. In addition, any product candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing products that have long histories of safe and effective use.
Although we are in the clinical development phase of operations and have no current therapeutic product sales, we believe the following companies, products and/or technologies may potentially be competitive with our technology or our product candidates under development:
•Protein pharmaceuticals under development at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as F. Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd., Protalix Biotherapeutics, Inc., Amicus Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis AG, Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Biogen, Inc. and numerous other biopharmaceutical firms.
•Gene therapy companies developing gene-based products in clinical trials such as BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc., F. Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd. through their wholly-owned subsidiary Spark Therapeutics, Freeline Therapeutics Holdings plc and 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Inc. Other competitors in this category may include PTC Therapeutics, Inc., Taysha Gene Therapies, Inc., uniQure N.V., Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc., Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. and numerous other gene therapy companies.
•Cell therapy companies developing cell-based products, including Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Bluebird bio, Inc., Aruvant Sciences, Inc., Editas Medicines, Inc., Graphite Bio, Inc., Beam Therapeutics, Inc., Medeor Therapeutics, Inc., Quell Therapeutics, Inc., Sonoma Biotherapeutics, Inc., 
AZTherapies, Inc., Reflection Therapeutics, Inc., Abata Therapeutics, Inc., TeraImmune, Inc., GentiBio, Inc. , Kyverna, Inc., Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Precision BioSciences, Inc., Orchard Therapeutics, Inc. and numerous other cell therapy companies.
•Nuclease and base editing technologies under development for therapeutic applications of genome modification including companies such as Editas Medicine, Inc., CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Caribou Biosciences, Inc., Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. and Beam Therapeutics developing the CRISPR/Cas editing system, Cellectis S.A. developing TALE nucleases and meganucleases, bluebird bio, Inc. developing Homing Endonucleases and MegaTALs and Precision BioSciences, Inc. developing meganucleases and numerous other gene editing companies.
•Antisense therapeutics and RNA interference technology, including RNAi and microRNA, which are technologies that may compete with ours in the development of novel therapeutic products acting through the regulation of gene expression. These technologies are being developed by several companies including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Wave Life Sciences, Inc., Moderna, Inc., Regulus Therapeutics Inc., Voyager Therapeutics, Inc and numerous other companies.
•Small molecules in development from both in-house drug discovery programs of pharmaceutical companies such as Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Biogen, Inc. and numerous other companies.
We expect to face intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with biopharmaceutical companies, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions, for licenses to proprietary technology and for subjects in our clinical trials of treatments for rare diseases. These competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective or less costly than ours.
Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to:
•develop safe, efficacious and commercially attractive proprietary products;
•obtain access to gene transfer technology on commercially reasonable terms;
•obtain required regulatory approvals;
•obtain reimbursement for our products in approved indications;
•attract and retain qualified scientific and product development personnel;
•enter into collaborative and strategic partnerships with others, including our competitors, to develop our technology and product candidates;
•obtain and enforce patents, licenses or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies;
•formulate, manufacture, market and sell any product that we develop;
•develop and maintain products that reach the market first and are technologically superior to or are of lower cost than other products in the market; and
•recruit subjects into our clinical trials in a timely fashion.
MANUFACTURING 
We currently rely heavily on CMOs to produce our preclinical and clinical product candidates in accordance with FDA and EMA mandated regulations, also known as current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. We employ a technical operations staff in the areas of process development, analytical development, quality control, quality assurance, project management, and manufacturing to facilitate appropriate oversight of our CMOs, support of our regulatory filings and execution of clinical trials. 
We believe that in-house manufacturing capability can provide a competitive advantage. To this end, we have recently completed and brought online an AAV cGMP manufacturing facility in Brisbane, California designed to manufacture Phase 1/2 clinical study supplies for our gene therapy pipeline, as well as cell therapy manufacturing facilities in Brisbane, California and Valbonne, France.
We intend to continue to rely on CMOs for the manufacture of our product candidates for any Phase 3 clinical trials, and if approved, for commercial supply. We believe this balanced approach to manufacturing, investing in internal capacity and capabilities while strengthening our commitment with external capacity, will enable us to meet our anticipated pipeline needs.
We currently leverage three distinct manufacturing platforms: AAV vector production for our genome engineering and gene therapy product candidates, HSPC modification for some of our cell therapy product candidates and engineered T cell therapies. We use a commercial scale baculovirus manufacturing platform to manufacture AAV vectors for genome editing and 
gene therapy, with each AAV vector packaging a different transgene specific to the target indication or ZF nuclease. The manufacturing process for our HSPC cell therapy product candidates utilizes the patient’s own HSPCs. These HSPCs are transfected using mRNA to produce ZF nucleases that target specific DNA sites, resulting in modified HSPCs. The third platform utilizes our ZF nuclease technology to transform CAR-Tregs for autologous and allogeneic cell therapies. We believe we have capabilities to manufacture regulatory T cells in therapeutic quantities to be used to treat inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
We operate within the heavily regulated biopharmaceutical industry and much of our operations, including nonclinical and clinical trials, development, manufacturing, commercialization, marketing and reimbursement are subject to regulatory approvals. Relevant regulatory authorities include, but are not limited to, the FDA, the EMA, Commission of the European Union, or EU, Member State agencies, including the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA.
Product Regulation 
In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products including gene therapy and human cellular therapy products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. Applications to the FDA are required before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products and in the EU, approval must be obtained from the EMA. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biologic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
U.S. Biologic Products Development Process
Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND application, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 days;
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;
•preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety and efficacy from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials and payment of user fees, if applicable;
•review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity;
•potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
•FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete additional preclinical testing, that may include animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Human gene transfer protocols are subject to the FDA’s oversight and other clinical trial regulations, and oversight at the local level as set forth in National Institutes of Health, or NIH, Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them.
The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
EU Drug Development Process
Similar to the United States, the EU regulatory framework sets both EU-wide and national, Member State-specific requirements for the development and approval of medicinal products. Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC sets out the contents of a marketing authorization, or MA, application and all the information that must be submitted for the evaluation of a medicinal product. Certain preclinical (also termed “non-clinical”) data is required in order to enable clinical trials and later be used in dossier for a marketing authorization application. All studies should take place in accordance with GLP and all applicable EMA, Commission and European Pharmacopoeia guidelines on preclinical studies, including guidance on quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of medicinal products containing genetically modified cells.
The requisite amount of preclinical data enables the design of a clinical trial, from Phase 1 (first-in-human clinical trials) through to Phases 2 and 3, which are safety and efficacy studies. Similar restrictions and requirements apply as in the United States regarding preclinical data to support trials using viral vectors. The preclinical tests should establish parameters such as toxicity, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties, as well as the quality of the gene therapy medicinal products. Due to the particular nature of gene therapy medicinal products, it is recognized that it may not always be possible for the non-clinical safety studies to be in conformity with the principles of GLP and a proper justification should be submitted where a pivotal non-clinical safety study has not been conducted under GLP rules.
Clinical studies are crucial to obtaining the required data and the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials are further analyzed below.
All medicinal products and advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, must be manufactured in accordance with the guidelines on GMP and in a GMP licensed facility, which can be subject to GMP inspections.
Human Clinical Trials Under an IND
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that 
assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into a small number of human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. Phase 1 clinical trials of gene and cell therapies are typically conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers.
•Phase 2. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a biologic product. In Phase 3 studies, the biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. Sometimes approval for a product is conditional upon the completion of post-marketing clinical studies.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies (such as the FDA, the EMA and other comparable regulatory agencies) require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA.
Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for: serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other trials, in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life‑threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable safety risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
The FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for up to a 15-year period.
In the EU, clinical trials almost always require approval from a national competent authority of the relevant Member State and an approval from an Ethics Committee. If the medicinal product is considered to be a genetically modified organism, or GMO, then GMO approval must also be obtained. There is no harmonization between Member States regarding the approach to and timelines of GMO approval, which may result in the submission of additional information, which may impact study initiation in a given country.
The conduct of clinical trials should follow the approved clinical trial protocol and be in accordance with the principles of GCP. Gene therapy medicinal products are in addition subject to the rules of GCP for ATMPs, which outline specific additional safeguards and requirements. Record retention requirements are increased for ATMPs as there are relevant long-term follow-up and human safety and traceability requirements.
Compliance with cGMP Requirements
Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any material changes to the manufacturing equipment, process or location of the approved manufacturing site must be reported to the relevant agency/authority. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities (including regulatory agencies) to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market, issue warning or similar letters or seeking civil, criminal or administrative sanctions against the company. The FDA will not approve a BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies develop additional information about the physical and biological characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
For a product candidate that is also a human cellular or tissue product, the FDA also requires compliance with current Good Tissue Practices, or cGTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC, and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for approved biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business or for a product indication for orphan diseases.
The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the BLA.
The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and effective, for its intended use and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the 
product candidate. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements.
On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review standard BLAs in 10 months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
EU Review and Approval Process
Before a medicinal product can be placed on the market in the EU, it must have received an MA. This could either be at national or EU level under a mutual recognition, decentralized or centralized procedure. Our product candidates are innovative treatments, which will bear the classification of ATMP. As such, the appropriate authorization procedure is the centralized procedure, which involves an MA being granted by the European Commission following a positive opinion by the EMA. A centralized MA is simultaneously valid in all EU Member States and the European Economic Area, or EEA (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). A centralized MA also results in a single set of product information (patient information leaflet, labelling and summary of product characteristics) for all EU Member States.
The timeline for the grant of a centralized MA since the time of the application is 210 days for the assessment of the application (including “clock stops” for the applicant to prepare answers to the questions from the EMA). The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, may either provide a positive or negative opinion. Following a positive opinion, the European Commission will usually issue its legally binding MA after 67 days. A negative opinion may be appealed by the applicant who must submit a request for re-examination within 60 days. There is the possibility for accelerated timelines of drug applications for eligible applicants, which can reduce the timeline to 150 days, if the applicant can produce sufficient justification.
If the MA application contains less comprehensive than the required standard as at the time of the application, when there are public health grounds and often in the case of orphan medicinal products, the EMA may recommend to the European Commission that it issues a different type of an MA, as follows: (a) a Conditional MA (valid for one year and renewable), when the medicinal product shows a positive benefit-risk balance and targets an unmet medical need and it is expected that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data in due course; or (b) an MA under ‘exceptional circumstances’, when it is not expected that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive efficacy and safety data (often for very rare indications).
Manufacturing Regulation in Europe
Various requirements apply to the manufacturing and placing on the EU market of medicinal products. The manufacturing of medicinal products in the EU requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including EU cGMP standards. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU member states. Marketing authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU member states’ requirements applicable to the manufacturing of medicinal products.
Post-approval Requirements
Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA, together with a release protocol, showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biologic products. Failure to comply with the FDA’s post-approval regulations can result in withdrawal of product approval and licensure.
A sponsor also must comply with the FDA’s or appropriate national authority’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”). Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Orphan and RMAT Designation
Products that are intended for treating rare conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or that affect more than 200,000 persons but are not expected to recover the costs of developing and marketing a treatment drug, may qualify for orphan designation. In the EU, these rare conditions are defined as having a prevalence of no more than five in every 10,000 people in the EU. Once a medicinal product with orphan designation obtains a marketing approval, it can benefit from a marketing exclusivity period in respect of the specific orphan indication for which the drug has been approved for a period of seven years in the U.S. and for up to 10 years in the EU. If the manufacturer is no longer able to assert that the product meets the orphan designation criteria or is not able to provide sufficient quantities, it may lose the orphan market exclusivity.
Regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation is intended to expedite review of a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. 
RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review of the related BLA. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. However, RMAT designation does not change the FDA’s standards for product approval. Additionally, RMAT designation can be revoked if the criteria for eligibility cease to be met as clinical data emerges.
Clinical Trial Data Disclosure
Many jurisdictions have mandatory clinical trial information obligations on sponsors. In the EU this is under the Transparency Regulation No. 1049/ 2001, EMA Policy 0043, EMA Policy 0070, as well as the new Clinical Trials Regulation No. 536/2014, all of which impose on sponsors the obligation to make publicly available certain information stemming from clinical studies. In the EU, the transparency framework provides for a wide right for (EU-based at the moment) interested parties to submit an access to documents request to the EMA for information included in the marketing authorization 
application dossier for approved medicinal products. Only very limited information is exempted from disclosure (i.e., commercially confidential information, which is construed increasingly narrowly and protected personal data). It is possible for competitors to access and use this data in their own research and development programs anywhere in the world, once these data are in the public domain.
Regulation of Our Operations
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation:
•the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
•federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, and individuals and entities that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information, known as business associates as well as covered subcontractors;
•the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
•analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to other healthcare providers and healthcare entities, marketing expenditures; or drug pricing; and/or ensure the registration of sales personnel; and
•state and foreign laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, suspension or withdrawal of our marketing and commercialization in respect of our commercially approved products, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can 
divert management’s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. See “Risk Factors—Our current and future relationships with healthcare providers, customers and third-party payors subject us to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, privacy, data security and other healthcare laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with such regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.”
Healthcare Reform 
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, if approved. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts, which include major legislative initiatives, such as the ACA, to reduce the cost of care through changes in the healthcare system, including limits on the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. The ACA and its implementing regulations, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including products similar to our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute, which provides incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D, and created a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products.
There have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to COVID-19 pandemic relief legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions are suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Further, Congress is considering additional health reform measures.
Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, on July 24, 2020 and 
September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. This rule has been delayed by the Biden administration until 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinds the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. Additionally, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these or similar measures will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
In the United States, the EU and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Furthermore, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
See “Risk Factors—Recently enacted and future legislation, including potentially unfavorable pricing regulations or other healthcare reform initiatives, may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.”
Pricing, Coverage and Reimbursement
Pricing and reimbursement of a therapeutic product will largely determine the affordability of the product, and whether the product is prescribed and supplied to patients and private insurance companies may take into account government reimbursement methodologies. Due to these proposed and enacted laws, as well as other actions, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval, particularly for novel products. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels, for such products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, these payors may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. See “Risk Factors—Even if we are able to commercialize our product candidates, the products may not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors in the United States and in other countries in which we seek to commercialize our products, which could harm our business.”
In the EU, pricing and reimbursement are the prerogative of Member States. Therefore, the requirements around reimbursement of medicinal products can vary widely. Each Member State can follow its own approach, subject to common rules of transparency, competition, and freedom of trade and movement in the EU. Many Member States, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom, follow a health technology assessment, or HTA, procedure for medicinal products in order to assess the cost-effectiveness of a product which could then be recommended for reimbursement under the national health services. There is increasingly exchange of information concerning HTAs on a voluntary basis among EU Member States. In 
the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is the body which conducts HTAs and issues guidance to be followed by the regional health bodies called clinical commissioning groups.
Environmental Regulation
U.S. federal and state laws regarding safe working conditions, environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations that continued compliance therewith will not have a material effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws and regulations may affect our future operations. 
Privacy Regulation
We are, or may become, subject to numerous privacy and data security laws and regulations in the United States and in other foreign jurisdictions, including, as applicable, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, the GDPR as it forms part of the United Kingdom’s law by virtue of Section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, or UK GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA.
The collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Economic Area, or EEA, including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements on us relating to, among other things, the control over personal data by individuals to whom the personal data relates, notice we must provide to individuals regarding our processing of their personal data, the documentation we must maintain, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification, and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries that the European Commission does not consider to provide an adequate level of privacy and data security (including the United States). While the European Commission recently issued a decision that allows transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United Kingdom to occur without restriction for a period of four years ending June 27, 2025, this decision could be withdrawn or not renewed, which would require us to implement additional mechanisms to continue making such transfers. The GDPR authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. The GDPR requirements related to international data transfers apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries such as Sangamo France, including employee information. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process compared to prior EU law, particularly in light of our acquisition of Sangamo France, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management’s attention and increase our cost of doing business. 
In the United States, federal, state and local governments have enacted numerous privacy and data security laws, including laws on data breach notification, personal data privacy and consumer protection. For example, the CCPA imposes various obligations, including obligations to provide detailed disclosures in privacy notices and affording California residents certain rights related to their personal data (including the right to delete their personal data and to opt out of the sale of their personal data). The CCPA includes potentially severe statutory damages (up to $7,500 per violation) and a private right of action for data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, effective on January 1, 2023, will significantly expand the CCPA. For example, the CPRA establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law and impose administrative fines. Other states have enacted similar laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which become effective in 2023.
Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly. See “Risk Factors—Our current and future relationships with healthcare providers, customers and third-party payors subject us to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including healthcare, privacy and data security laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.”

We are a passionate group of biotechnology professionals based in the United States, France and the United Kingdom with years of experience and technical expertise, committed to developing best-in-class genomic medicines. We embrace collaboration, discipline and efficiency while welcoming fresh ideas and stimulating personal development. We encourage and embrace diversity, equity and inclusion, and believe it enhances our work towards one common goal: to transform the lives of the patients we aim to serve.
We view our employees as one of our most valuable assets in serving our mission. We compete in the highly competitive biotechnology industry, and attracting, retaining and developing a diverse group of talented employees is crucial to our strategy and our ability to compete effectively. We are committed to the development and retention of our workforce to support our research, product development, manufacturing and regulatory efforts and our plans for commercializing our wholly-owned product candidates when approved. There currently is a shortage of skilled individuals with substantial experience discovering, developing and manufacturing genomic medicines, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for these individuals is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We face substantial competition among numerous biopharmaceutical companies and academic institutions for individuals with these skills.

Our Management of Human Capital
We hired our first Chief People Officer in September 2020 to lead our human resources function and to expand our investments in recruiting, retaining and developing our employees. As of December 31, 2021, our global human resources function was comprised of 10 full time human resources professionals.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 431 full time employees located in the United States, France and the United Kingdom. Of these employees, 341 were located in the United States, primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area, 83 were located in Valbonne, France and the remaining seven were located near London, United Kingdom. Of these employees, 185 were primarily engaged in research and development activities, 163 were primarily engaged in technical operations and manufacturing and 83 were primarily engaged in general and administrative activities. We also engage the services of independent contractors and consultants as needed for special or temporary projects or specific expertise. 
To manage our human resources, we track and report internally on key talent metrics including headcount by business unit and country, historical headcount growth, turnover, new hires and terminations, open roles and employee demographics including gender, race and ethnicity. Our senior executives use these metrics to assist with resource planning, recruitment and retention initiatives and the design of our compensation and benefits programs. We share these metrics quarterly with the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors to assist it in fulfilling its duties to (a) establish our enterprise compensation philosophy, (b) administer our compensation and benefit plans, (c) evaluate the performance of our executive officers and key employees and (d) review and monitor management development and succession plans.
In 2021, we launched our first employee engagement survey. The results of this survey helped us better understand the culture, work dynamics and overall commitment of our employees and to also identify areas of focus that will increase overall employee engagement. We were happy with our participation rate of 79% and over 385 comments, and results demonstrating favorable levels of employee satisfaction.
Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We strongly believe in a diverse workplace where all Sangamo employees can thrive in an inclusive environment free from discrimination, harassment, bias and prejudice. We aim to treat all individuals with respect and dignity and to provide all Sangamo employees with equal opportunity and fair treatment based on merit. By embracing diversity and inclusion, we create an organization committed to working together to develop innovative solutions in support of the Sangamo mission consistent with our values. At Sangamo, we cultivate a culture and environment where different backgrounds and perspectives are not only respected and heard, but embraced and celebrated. Not only is a diverse, equitable and inclusive mindset and culture critical to an engaged and committed workplace, but it is also imperative in delivering innovative solutions for our patients.
Sangamo employee demographics as of December 31, 2021:
Ethnicity data is for U.S. employees only
We have an active Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, or DEI, working group comprised of a diverse group of employees responsible for designing and implementing specific initiatives to promote greater diversity, equity and inclusion at Sangamo worldwide. In 2021, we launched six employee resource groups, or ERGs, that are led by employees in partnership with an executive sponsor, and we have dedicated budgets for each of these ERGs so that they can make a specific impact in the areas of building and reinforcing community, development and talent attraction. We are working on various partnerships with Life Science Cares, a non-profit organization with a mission of leveraging the resources of life science companies to help reduce the effects of poverty, and our Chief Operating Officer, D. Mark McClung, serves as a board member. We have also participated in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index to better align our investments and initiatives with our employees.
Our Compensation and Benefits
Given the highly competitive nature of our industry and the importance of recruitment and retention to our success, we strive to provide our employees with what we believe is a very competitive and comprehensive total rewards package of compensation, benefits and services. This package includes at or above-market pay; healthcare benefits for employees and family members; a health savings account for eligible U.S. employees with above market employer contributions; generous paid time off benefits; family leave; bereavement leave; flexible work schedules; contributions to retirement and/or pension plans; a supplemental long term disability plan, mental health benefits and onsite gym access. In addition, we offer a monthly stipend for employees to spend on health and well-being.

Our U.S. employees are also eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan, which offers the opportunity to purchase our common stock at a discount of at least 15%.
