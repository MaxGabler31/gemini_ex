Business Segments and Industry Overview
The Company has operating segments that are organized around three strategic business units consisting of Electrical & Electronic Solutions ("EES"), Communications & Security Solutions ("CSS") and Utility & Broadband Solutions ("UBS").
The following is a description of each of the Company's business segments and the industries in which they operate.
Electrical & Electronic Solutions
The EES segment, with over 6,400 employees supporting customers in over 50 countries, supplies a broad range of products and solutions primarily to the construction, industrial and original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") markets. Construction and industrial customers include a wide array of contractors, and engineering, procurement and construction firms for industrial, infrastructure, commercial, and data and broadband communications projects. Specific applications include projects for refineries, railways, wastewater treatment facilities, data centers, security installations, offices, and modular and mobile homes. OEM customers require products used in the manufacturing of automotive, industrial, medical, transportation, marine, military and communications equipment. The product portfolio in this business includes a broad range of electrical equipment and supplies, automation and connected devices (the "Internet of Things" or "IoT"), security, lighting, wire and cable, safety, and maintenance, repair and operating ("MRO") products from industry-leading manufacturing partners. The EES service portfolio includes contractor solutions to improve project execution, direct and indirect manufacturing supply chain optimization programs, lighting and renewables advisory services, and digital and automation solutions to improve safety and productivity. The EES segment operates in highly fragmented markets that include thousands of small regional and locally based, privately owned competitors as well as several large, multi-national companies.
Communications & Security Solutions
The CSS segment, with over 3,300 employees supporting customers in over 50 countries, is a global leader in the network infrastructure and security markets. The network infrastructure market is comprised of cabling and connectivity, racks and cabinets, power, wireless, and associated products that enable network connectivity and communications in commercial buildings, and hyperscale, cloud-based and multi-tenant data centers. The security market includes video surveillance, fire and intrusion detection, access control, door locking and other solutions that create safe and smart environments for customers. Both the network infrastructure and security businesses are large, fragmented and diverse markets that include various industry groups such as technology, finance, telecommunications service providers, transportation, education, government, healthcare and retail. CSS sells products directly to end-users or through various channels including data communications contractors, security, network, professional audio/visual and systems integrators. In addition to the core network infrastructure and security portfolio, CSS has a broad offering of safety and energy management solutions. CSS products are often combined with supply chain services to increase efficiency and productivity, including installation enhancement, project deployment, advisory, and IoT and digital services.
Utility & Broadband Solutions
The UBS segment, with over 2,400 employees supporting customers primarily in the U.S. and Canada, provides products and services to investor-owned utilities, public power companies, including municipalities, as well as global service providers, wireless providers, broadband operators and the contractors that service these customers. Investor-owned utility companies provide a combination of electric generation, transmission and/or distribution and are owned by investors or shareholders while public power entities are generally non-profit entities owned by their members or governed by local, state and municipal governments. These two markets comprise the vast majority of utility customers in the U.S. and Canada. The UBS segment also includes Wesco's integrated supply business, which provides products and services to large industrial and commercial end-users to support their MRO spend. The products sold into the utility and broadband markets include wire and cable, transformers, transmission and distribution hardware, switches, protective devices, connectors, lighting, conduit, fiber and copper cable, connectivity products, pole line hardware, racks, cabinets, safety and MRO products, and point-to-point wireless devices. We also offer a complete set of service solutions including fiber project management, high and medium voltage project design and support, pre-wired meters and capacitor banks, meter testing and advanced metering infrastructure installation, personal protective equipment dielectric testing, tool repair, emergency response management, storage yard management, materials management, and logistics management to improve customer supply chain efficiencies.

Business Strategy
Wesco’s vision is to be the best tech-enabled supply chain solutions provider in the world. We believe that accomplishing this vision depends on the successful execution of our strategy, which is comprised of three elements:
Integrate the Business and Build World-Class Capabilities: Wesco completed the transformative acquisition of Anixter International, another leading supplier of business-to-business distribution, logistics services and supply chain solutions on June 
22, 2020. The Merger combined two comparable-sized businesses and created an industry leader of electrical, communications, and utility supply chain solutions. A central component of our current strategy is to ensure that we capture all of the potential value of the combination of the two businesses.
Strengthen the Organization and our Culture of Excellence: A commitment to continuous improvement has always been a hallmark of our business, and we deploy Lean business practices and Agile methodologies. The merger with Anixter has enabled us to continue building our Culture of Excellence, including selecting the best-of-the-best Wesco and Anixter leaders for the combined organization, enhancing our commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues, expanding our Inclusion and Diversity program, and establishing systems to recognize outstanding employees and demonstration of Wesco’s five core values: Our People are Our Greatest Asset, One Team, Always Strive to Be the Best, Innovation, and Winning With Customers and Suppliers.
Digitalize and Transform the Business: The role of digital business models in our industry has accelerated over the past several years. Wesco offers significant digital capabilities today and intends to lead the further digitalization of our industry in the years to come. The larger size and scale of the combined business enables Wesco to invest in the deployment of digital and service capabilities significantly faster than it could previously. We are implementing digital tools across every aspect of our business to improve the efficiency of our operations as well as those of our business partners, make it easier to do business with Wesco, and increase the value of our big data by providing unique insight into end-market use of the products and services we offer.
The three elements of our strategy touch every aspect of our business – from how we go-to-market within our three strategic business units to how we drive efficiency and build our culture across the organization. We believe that the successful execution of these strategies, combined with our comprehensive product and service offerings, will provide cost-effective and innovative end-to-end supply chain solutions for a diverse set of customers across our end markets. Our operating cash flow is deployed to fund organic growth opportunities, acquire businesses that provide new capabilities for growth, and manage our capital structure. Due to our leadership position, scale, global reach, complete portfolio of products, extensive services and insights from big data, we expect to grow our sales over the long term at a faster rate than the overall industry.
As a distribution and supply chain services company, our approach to sustainability is to minimize the environmental impacts of our own operations and assist our customers and suppliers with attaining their sustainability goals through the products and services we can provide. We do this by designing and providing solutions that enable them to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions at their facilities and in their supply chains; improve productivity through automation; increase output more efficiently and effectively through digital tools and applications. We build on our own internal strategies for sustainability, while reinforcing our corporate responsibility. Our sustainability efforts are an integral part of our operations and core values.
Customers
We have a large base of approximately 140,000 active customers across commercial and industrial businesses, contractors, government agencies, institutions, telecommunications providers, and utilities. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 11% of our sales in 2021. No one customer accounted for more than 2% of our sales in 2021.
Products
Our global network of branches, warehouses and sales offices provide customers with access to nearly 1,500,000 different products. Each location tailors its inventory to meet the needs of its customers, providing a local presence and a global network to service multi-location businesses and multi-national corporations.
We purchase products from a diverse group of approximately 45,000 suppliers who are located predominantly in North America, but manufacture products around the world. The main product categories we source are general supplies, communications and security, wire, cable and conduit, lighting and sustainability, electrical distribution and controls, and automation and motors. In 2021, our ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 31% of our purchases. No one supplier accounted for more than 5% of our total purchases.
Our supplier relationships are important to us, providing access to a wide range of products, services, technical training, and sales and marketing support. We have approximately 700 commercial agreements with more than 375 preferred suppliers and purchase nearly 65% of our products pursuant to these arrangements.
We offer a wide range of sustainable products from the world’s leading manufacturers and can help our customers determine the best solution to meet their sustainability goals. Key categories include energy-efficient products, energy-management solutions, renewable energy products, sustainable MRO products, and workplace safety products.
Services
Our customers' challenges are constantly evolving and require comprehensive, yet practical solutions. As part of our overall offerings, we provide a comprehensive portfolio of value-added solutions, as outlined below, designed to address our customers' business needs, help save time, improve productivity, increase profitability, and mitigate risk.
•Installation enhancement services to adapt products and packaging to streamline processes and reduce the total cost of installation;

We are also a provider of services focused on energy efficiency and renewable power that reduce our consumption and that of our customers. Our energy solutions business offers turnkey and retrofit solutions designed to reduce energy and optimize building efficiency. We also have a team of renewables experts that focus on providing technical support to installers and end-users of solar products and solutions.
Business Strengths
Wesco’s mission is to help our customers build, connect, power and protect the world. We believe that our business possesses several strengths that will enable us to achieve this mission. The environment in which we operate is highly fragmented and there is significant competition within each end market and geographic area that we serve. Customers look to product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, geographic proximity and price. We believe that our scale, broad portfolio of products, technical expertise, global reach with local relationships, comprehensive value-added services, and smart, digital solutions all provide distinct advantages that benefit our customers.
Broad Portfolio of Products from Top Brands. Our broad product portfolio enables us to offer comprehensive, end-to-end solutions in each of our three businesses. We partner with the industries’ leading suppliers to deliver the most trusted brands across every product category including automation, broadband, communications, electrical, electronics, energy, lighting, MRO, networking, renewables, safety, security, utility and wire and cable.
Customized Solutions. Our customers have unique business models, challenges and priorities. Our dedicated technical experts have extensive experience and product knowledge that enable them to provide solutions tailored to the various needs of our customers. With specialized industry knowledge and a focus on the latest technologies, we help design and deploy solutions that address critical business priorities.
Ingenuity and Expertise. Since closing the merger with Anixter, we have focused our teams and empowered them with access to real-time information and tools that enable better decision-making and facilitate easier interaction with customers. Our sales, service and operational specialists bring a depth of industry experience spanning construction, manufacturing, electrical, renewables, lighting, communications, security, professional A/V, utility, broadband and more.
Innovative Digital Roadmap. We are investing in digital tools and platforms to enable a new level of collaboration, agility and productivity. From adaptable omni-channel e-commerce tools and platforms, to connected buildings and process management, we are a supply chain partner that strives to match our customers’ digital needs and drive operational excellence.
Global Reach with Local Expertise. Our international operations and global sourcing capabilities enable us to service our customers around the world. Wesco has approximately 800 branches, warehouses and sales offices with operations in more than 50 countries. Our global distribution network includes 43 facilities that operate as regional distribution centers or large branch locations in key geographic areas in North America, Europe and South America. These facilities add value for our customers and suppliers through the combination of inventory selection, online ordering, shipment capabilities, and order handling and fulfillment. Our global network allows us to enhance local customer service by tailoring individual branch products and services to local customer needs.
Comprehensive Value-Added Services. We provide a wide range of value-added services, which draw on our product knowledge and logistics expertise, to help our customers save time, improve productivity, mitigate risk and increase profitability. Our broad service offering includes installation enhancement, materials management, kitting and labeling, extensive MRO solutions, onsite job trailer solutions, end-to-end supply chain management and project management/execution across the project lifecycle.
Smart, Digital Solutions. Our work with technology companies brings capabilities in digital and information-based solutions. These solutions include global e-commerce platforms, vendor managed inventory, point of use systems, last mile optimization, supply chain engineering and intelligent automation. From enterprise-wide connectivity to real-time analytics and reporting, our digital ecosystem supports our customers’ business needs.
Uniquely Positioned to Benefit from Secular Trends. Each of our business units is positioned to benefit from six secular trends that are driving growth. These include increasing electrification, growth of automation and connected devices (the "Internet of Things" or "IoT"), green energy and electric grid modernization, 24/7 connectivity and security, supply chain consolidation and relocation to North America, and digitalization.
Geography
We sell to global customers through our network of branches, warehouses and sales offices consisting of 485 locations in the U.S., 147 in Canada, 55 in Europe and the Middle East, 54 in Central America, the Caribbean and South America, and 40 in the Asia Pacific region, which includes Australia. This includes 43 facilities that operate as regional distribution centers or large branch locations, of which 34 are located in the U.S., six are in Canada, two are in Europe and one is in South America.
Human Capital
At Wesco, our people and our high-performance culture are our greatest assets. We are committed to continuous improvement and leveraging our diverse and talented workforce in pursuing Wesco’s vision to be the best tech-enabled supply chain solutions provider in the world. We also believe that our employees should be treated with dignity and respect. Our Human Rights Policy promotes diversity, safety in the workplace, freedom of association and collective bargaining, and training. It prohibits discrimination, harassment, and child and forced labor. It also provides guidance on appropriate working hours, wages and benefits, and workplace conditions.
The merger of Wesco and Anixter doubled the Company’s revenue, and significantly increased our employee headcount and global footprint, including the number of countries in which we operate. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 18,000 full-time employees worldwide, with approximately 12,000 in the U.S. and the remaining 6,000 in international locations.
Compensation and Benefits Program. Wesco provides competitive compensation and benefits packages in each of our locations around the globe. In the U.S., we provide a comprehensive benefits program that offers choices to fit our employees’ diverse needs including health and disability benefits, paid time-off, life insurance, retirement programs, and access to other services that support health and wellness. To further improve the health of our employees, we offer a variety of activities and programs that assist our employees and their family members to better manage or overcome major well-being challenges, including an employee assistance program, wellness coaching, case/disease management and wellness discounts.
Inclusion and Diversity. WESCO's commitment to inclusion and diversity starts at the top. The Company’s Board of Directors has four of its nine members (44%) who are diverse in terms of gender, race or ethnicity, and the Board has a goal to be 50% or more diverse.
As part of Wesco's integration with Anixter, we conducted “pulse” surveys in 2020 to give all employees a voice in actively shaping the values that will define the combined organization, one of which is inclusion and diversity. We continued these surveys in 2021 to help provide a lens into the organization for senior management to monitor how employees are managing through changes as we continue to integrate systems and processes and to provide a roadmap for us to support employee success.
The goals of Wesco’s Inclusion and Diversity program are to 1) leverage the unique experiences and perspectives of our talented workforce to support Wesco’s mission, 2) further engage employees and build an inclusive culture, 3) recruit and develop talent that bring new perspectives and thought processes to Wesco, 4) increase representation of suppliers that are owned and operated by teams with diverse backgrounds and 5) support the communities in which we operate.
Wesco has established an Inclusion & Diversity Council comprised of members of our senior management, including the Vice President of Inclusion & Diversity, to lead the formation of four Business Resource Groups (“BRGs”) that will support four groups – women, BLIPOC (Black, Latino, Indigenous, and People of Color), LGBTQ+, and veterans of the armed forces. These BRGs foster a sense of community and inclusion, provide opportunities to network, support advancement opportunities within the organization, and assist with recruiting. The BRGs are global and open to all employees regardless of any aspect of their personal identity. As of May 1, 2021, approximately 1,800 employees from around the globe had joined one or more of the BRGs. Comprising employees from every level of the organization, the BRGs: play a critical role in supporting our business initiatives; help create a more inclusive work environment; provide opportunities for employee development, education, training, recruitment, retention, and business outreach; and support innovation by providing insights on new markets, product development, and multicultural marketing.
Wesco has established relationships with several charitable organizations and encourages employees to volunteer in the community by providing one day of paid volunteer time per year. By connecting with and contributing to local charitable organizations, Wesco supports the development of strong, vibrant and diverse communities.
Safety. Safety is a core value of Wesco and we do not tolerate violations of established safety protocol. We are committed to reducing or eliminating health and safety risks through dedicated programs, leadership commitment, and employee involvement. We seek to achieve continuous improvement in the safety of our facilities and injury-leading injury rates.
We have exceeded our goal of a 40% reduction in our total recordable injury rate (“TRIR”) from a 2017 baseline – two years ahead of the 2022 target. We have also set a long-term goal to achieve a 15% reduction in the TRIR by 2030 from a 2020 baseline of 0.47 incidents per 100 employees.
Training and Development. Wesco offers several certification and training programs, some of which are required for all employees while others are voluntary or based on job role. We offer a tuition reimbursement program to eligible employees to encourage the pursuit of undergraduate and graduate education to prepare employees for expanded roles in the business.
We have had a sales development training program in place for over ten years. The program is designed to systematically train and develop new college graduates through on-the-job rotations and cohort learning and development during the first year of employment. Graduates of the program move into various sales and operations roles after completing the one-year program. We also sponsor a summer internship program to provide college students with real work experience and give them the opportunity to evaluate different career fields. Additionally, we have a finance development program for recent college graduates seeking a career in finance that provides members with eligibility for roles with increasing responsibilities commensurate with their career development goals.
Environmental Management
Environmental sustainability is a priority for Wesco. We are progressing toward and achieving our goals, learning as we go, and making sustainability practices accessible to our employees and customers. The foundation of our environmental management is our Environmental Sustainability Policy, which aligns with key provisions of the ISO 14001 environmental management standards. The policy includes clear management accountability for environmental sustainability, direct program responsibilities, and key performance indicators and other metrics to track progress.
We are working to reduce our environmental impact in the following areas: 
Energy. The vast majority of the energy we use is for lighting, heating, and cooling our approximately 800 branches, warehouses, and sales offices around the world. Adding to our energy consumption is a fleet of approximately 950 trucks and 1,400 cars for our distribution and sales activities. Wherever possible, we engage with the owners and agents of the buildings we lease to improve energy efficiency by providing landlords with specifications that include the installation of LED lighting and programmable thermostats, and recommendations for heating, ventilation and air conditioning. Our Fleet Efficiency Policy includes the use of fuel-efficient vehicles, determining the most efficient routes, and idling restrictions.
Emissions. Our main source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the power used by our facilities, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of our total emissions. As such, the energy efficiency of our buildings is a key focus of our emissions-reduction activities. Our secondary source of GHG emissions is our truck and car fleet, and a small percentage of our emissions is due to corporate travel and the lifecycle impact of our landfilled waste. We continue to look for new opportunities to reduce our fleet emissions through routing and consolidation, and we are also researching the use of electric vehicles as technology and infrastructure improve.
Waste. Our top three waste streams are cardboard, wood pallets, and plastic. To manage this waste, we first find opportunities to minimize the amount that we generate by applying lean principles. We then identify reuse and recycling opportunities.
Water. As a distributor and services provider, we are not a major consumer of water. Our facilities primarily use water for sanitation, cleaning, and irrigation purposes. We track water usage at each of our locations and use the data to identify unusual consumption patterns that could indicate undetected leaks or excessive usage that requires intervention.
Cyber Security
Cyber security and protection of our data is a top priority across the entire organization. To that end, we take a holistic approach to securing our data and business systems from attack, compromise or loss. This includes the combination of leading technologies, policies and procedures, and a 7x24 Cyber Security Operations team monitoring our environment for signs of attack and responding in real-time.
The implementation of a multi-layer and multi-provider portfolio of technologies is designed to deliver overlapping coverage against today’s modern attack vectors with a strong defensive and offensive security posture. We continually evaluate risks, threats, intelligence feeds and vulnerabilities to adapt, mitigate or respond as necessary to preserve a secure state. Combining technology, processes and threat intelligence we deliver specific and timely education and training to the organization, including mandatory training for all employees.
While we focus heavily on prevention and detection, response and recovery plans, service agreements and partner engagements are in place should there be a need for us to respond to an attack. We also maintain cyber liability insurance coverage. We did not experience any material data breaches in 2021.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, patents and trade secrets, foreign intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We currently have trademarks, patents and service marks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in various other countries. The trademarks and service marks filed in the U.S. include, among others: “Wesco®” and our corporate logo. The Company's "Anixter" trademarks and service marks are registered in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions and its "EECOL" service mark is registered in Canada. We have also applied to register international trademarks, patents, and service mark applications in various foreign jurisdictions. While our patents have value, none is so essential that its loss would materially affect our business.
Environmental Matters
Our facilities and operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations may impose strict, joint and several liabilities on certain persons for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated properties. These persons may include former, current or future owners or operators of properties and persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Our owned and leased real property may give rise to such investigation, remediation and monitoring liabilities under environmental laws. In addition, anyone disposing of certain products we distribute, such as ballasts, fluorescent lighting and batteries, must comply with environmental laws that regulate certain materials in these products.
We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws. As a result, we do not anticipate making significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current year or in the near future.
Seasonality
Our operating results are not significantly affected by seasonal factors. Sales during the first and fourth quarters are usually affected by a reduced level of activity due to the impact of weather on projects. Sales typically increase beginning in March, with slight fluctuations per month through October. During periods of economic expansion or contraction, our sales by quarter have varied significantly from this pattern.
