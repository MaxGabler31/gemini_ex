ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 22, 1998 under the name Bear Lake Recreation Inc., with an initial authorized capital consisting of 50,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common voting stock.
 
Our initial operations consisted of renting snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles (ATV’s). We had also planned on organizing snowmobile rental packages, which would have included lodging at Ideal Beach Resort at Bear Lake, Utah. On or about October 1999, we abandoned the snowmobile, ATV and lodging plans. Our lack of success was attributed to entering the marketplace comprising this endeavor during a year that was the beginning of a drought cycle, resulting in below average snowfall and competitive growth from one to three self-promoting developmental properties. Our operations ceased due to depleted capital resources resulting from offering vacation packages lacking in demand.
 
On June 27, 2000, we entered into a licensing agreement with AlCORP, an Oregon limited liability company, to purchase the right to manufacture, use, market and sell the “NetCaddy,” a backpack style bag used to transport fishing gear. By the end of the first quarter of 2002, we had also abandoned the “Net Caddy” operations. We realized only minimal sales through our e-commerce site and 800 number infomercial advertisements. Additionally, due to the exhaustion of our capital resources, we could no longer maintain the infrastructure required for sales promotion while faced with limited consumer demand.
 
All computations herein take into account a one for three and one-half (1 for 3.5) share reverse split of our outstanding shares of common stock that was effective on or about October 23, 2006, and which is discussed below under this heading.
 
The following is a summary of material business developments since our inception through March 2018:
 

· | 285,734 shares of our common stock were issued to our principal founder at inception for services valued at $1,000. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Completed the offer and sale of approximately 12,868 shares of our common stock to public investors under Rule 504 of Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in March, 1999, for aggregate consideration of $45,000. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Completed the offer and sale of approximately 94,066 shares of our common stock to persons who were “accredited investors” under Rule 506 of Regulation D in July and August, 2000, for aggregate consideration of $41,150.

· | Our common stock was granted quotations on the OTC Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”) on or about December 31, 2005, and we were assigned a trading symbol of “BLKR.” 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On March 1, 2006, we amended Section 2.11 of our Bylaws to allow for written action to be taken without a meeting by less than all of the stockholders. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Amended and restated our Articles of Incorporation, effective in April, 2006. The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation were unanimously adopted by our Board of Directors, who then also constituted our majority stockholders, collectively beneficially owning approximately 857,143 shares of our common stock or approximately 68.6% of our outstanding voting securities, as Board members and stockholders. No other votes were required or necessary to adopt the amendments to our Articles of Incorporation, and none were solicited. The following is a summary of the material changes to our Articles of Incorporation: (i) five million (5,000,000) shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share were authorized; (ii) the minimum number of our directors was reduced to one; (iii) our Board of Directors was authorized to change our name in certain circumstances, without stockholder approval; and (iv) our Board of Directors was authorized to effect recapitalizations in the form of forward or reverse splits in certain circumstances, without a stockholder approval. We filed a Definitive Information Statement with the SEC on March 20, 2006.

Description of Business
 
We had no material business operations from 2002 until the Acquisition and prior to the Acquisition we were a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).
The Control Block Acquisition 
 
On April 26, 2017, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 5, 2017, by and among Manchester Explorer, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Manchester”), the Company and certain persons named therein (the “SPA”), Manchester purchased from the Company (the “Control Block Acquisition”) 2,900,000 shares (the “Control Block”), of newly issued, restricted common stock, par value, $0.001, per share, for a purchase price of $375,000 (approximately $0.13 per share), resulting in a change in control of the Company. In connection with the Control Block Acquisition, James E. Besser was appointed president and a director and Morgan C. Frank was appointed the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, secretary, treasurer and a director of the Company and immediately following such appointments, Wayne R. Bassham resigned as director and President, Derrick M. Albiston resigned as director and Vice President, and Todd L. Albiston resigned as director, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company. For additional information regarding the Control Block Acquisition, see our Current Report on Form 8-K that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 1, 2017.
The Acquisition
 
On July 24, 2017, pursuant to a Reorganization and Share Exchange Agreement, by and among the Company, Paul M. DiPerna, the sole officer and director and the controlling stockholder of Quasuras Inc., a Delaware company (“Quasuras”), Messrs. Besser and Frank (Messrs. Besser, Frank and Mr. DiPerna, shall sometimes be collectively referred to as the “3 Quasuras Shareholders”) and Quasuras (the “Acquisition Agreement”), the Company acquired all 4,400,000 issued and outstanding shares of Quasuras’ common stock owned by the 3 Quasuras Shareholders (which represented 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Quasuras) in exchange for 7,582,060 shares of our common stock, resulting in Quasuras becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Acquisition”) and Mr. DiPerna owning approximately 47% of our issued and outstanding common stock, after giving effect to the Private Placement (as defined below) and the Share Cancellation (as defined below). Simultaneously with the closing of the Acquisition and pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, (i) Mr. Besser resigned as president and a director and Mr. Frank resigned as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, secretary, and treasurer, but remained a director of the Company, and (ii) Mr. DiPerna was appointed our chairman, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, secretary and treasurer.
 
In anticipation of the closing of the Acquisition, on June 27, 2017, the Company changed its name from “Bear Lake Recreation, Inc.” to “Modular Medical, Inc.” and changed its trading symbol from “BLKE” to “MODD” which symbol and name change was approved by FINRA and became effective on June 29, 2017.
 
The Acquisition was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein Quasuras is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Acquisition and as a condition thereto, we sold (the “Private Placement”), in a private placement an aggregate of 7,233,031 for cash and 568,182 from reissuance of previously cancelled shares of our common stock pursuant to one or more exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, at a purchase price of $0.66 per share resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $4,731,872. Simultaneously with the Acquisition and Private Placement, the Company cancelled all 2,900,000 Control Block shares it had issued in the Control Block Acquisition (the “Share Cancellation”). In connection with the Private Placement, we paid $41,928 as compensation in connection with sales of our shares therein.
 
Unless otherwise indicated, all information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to periods prior to the date on which we consummated the Acquisition relates solely to Modular, without regard to the Acquisition.
 
For additional information regarding the Acquisition, see our Current Report on Form 8-K that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on July 28, 2017.

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business 
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, and we are subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company.” That designation will relieve us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation S-K.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 
We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs.
 
Exchange Act Reporting Requirements
 
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our stockholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our stockholders.
 
We are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the Securities Exchange Commission on a regular basis, and are required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Number of Total Employees and Number of Full-Time Employees
 
We currently employ the following four (4) employees at the Company:
 

· | Paul DiPerna, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and Director (August 1, 2017 - Present);
