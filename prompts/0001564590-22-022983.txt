ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 As used herein, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, all references to “Orion,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and similar references are to Orion Energy Systems, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 Overview
 We provide state-of-the-art light emitting diode (“LED”) lighting systems, wireless Internet of Things (“IoT”) enabled control solutions, project engineering, energy project management design and maintenance services. We help our customers achieve their sustainability, energy savings and carbon footprint reduction goals through innovative technology and exceptional service. We research, design, develop, manufacture, market, sell, install, and implement energy management systems consisting primarily of high-performance, energy-efficient commercial and industrial interior and exterior LED lighting systems and related services. Our products are targeted for applications in three primary market segments: commercial office and retail, area lighting, and industrial applications, although we do sell and install products into other markets. Our services consist of turnkey installation and system maintenance. Virtually all of our sales occur within North America.
 Our principal customers include large national account end-users, electrical distributors, electrical contractors and energy service companies (“ESCOS”). Currently, a significant amount of our products are manufactured at our leased production facility located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, although as the LED and related IoT market continues to evolve, we are increasingly sourcing products and components from third parties in order to diversify our product offerings.
 We differentiate ourselves from our competitors thorough offering comprehensive project management services to national account customers to retrofit their multiple locations. Our comprehensive services include initial site surveys and audits, utility incentive and government subsidy management, engineering design, and project management from delivery through to installation and controls integration. In addition, we began to offer lighting and electrical maintenance services in fiscal 2021 which enables us to support a lifetime business relationship with our customers.
 Our lighting products consist primarily of LED lighting fixtures, many of which include IoT enabled control systems provided by third parties. We believe the market for LED lighting products continues to grow. Due to their size and flexibility in application, we also believe that LED lighting systems can address opportunities for retrofit applications that cannot be satisfied by other lighting technologies. 
 We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers for product or turnkey services that provide us with recurring annual revenue. However, our maintenance services contracts usually consist of multi-year arrangements. We typically generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of lighting systems and related services to governmental, commercial and industrial customers on a project-by-project basis. We also perform work under global services or product purchasing agreements with major customers with sales completed on a purchase order basis. The loss of, or substantial reduction in sales to, any of our significant customers, or our current single largest customer, or the termination or delay of a significant volume of purchase orders by one or more key customers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given future period.
 We typically sell our lighting systems in replacement of our customers’ existing lighting fixtures. We call this replacement process a "retrofit". We frequently sell our products and services directly to our customers and in many cases we provide design and installation as well as project management services. We also sell our lighting systems on a wholesale basis, principally to electrical distributors, electrical contractors and ESCOs to sell to their own customer bases.
 The gross margins of our products can vary significantly depending upon the types of products we sell, with gross margins typically ranging from 10% to 50%. As a result, a change in the total mix of our sales among higher or lower gross margin products can cause our profitability to fluctuate from period to period.
 Our fiscal year ends on March 31. We refer to our current fiscal year which ended on March 31, 2022 as "fiscal 2022". We refer to our most recently completed fiscal year, which ended on March 31, 2021, as “fiscal 2021”, and our prior fiscal year which ended on March 31, 2020 as "fiscal 2020". Our fiscal first quarter of each fiscal year ends on June 30, our fiscal second quarter ends on September 30, our fiscal third quarter ends on December 31, and our fiscal fourth quarter ends on March 31.

 Our Market Opportunity
 We provide enterprise-grade LED lighting and energy management project solutions. We are primarily focused on providing commercial and industrial facilities lighting retrofit solutions in North America using solid-state LED technology. We believe the market for lighting products has shifted to LED lighting systems and continues to grow. We believe that LED lighting technology allows for better optical performance, significantly reduced maintenance costs due to performance longevity and reduced energy consumption. Due to their size and flexibility in application, we also believe that LED lighting systems can address opportunities for retrofit applications that cannot be satisfied by other technologies. 
 Our products deliver energy savings and efficiency gains to our commercial and industrial customers without compromising their quantity or quality of light. We estimate that our energy management systems reduce our customers’ legacy lighting-related electricity costs by approximately 50% or greater, while maintaining their quantity of light after the reduced wattage and improving overall lighting quality when replacing traditional fixtures. Our customers with legacy lighting systems typically realize a one to four-year payback period, and most often 18 – 24 months, from electricity cost savings generated by our lighting systems without considering utility incentives or government subsidies. Energy-efficient lighting systems are cost-effective and environmentally responsible solutions allowing end users to reduce operating expenses and their carbon footprint.
 We serve government and private sector end-customers in the following primary markets: commercial office and retail, exterior area lighting and industrial applications.
 Commercial office and retail. Our commercial office and retail market includes commercial office buildings, retail store fronts, government offices, schools, hospitals and other buildings with traditional 10 to 12 foot ceiling heights. 
 Industrial applications. Our market for industrial facilities includes manufacturing facilities, distribution and warehouse facilities, government buildings and agricultural buildings. These facilities typically contain "high-bay" lighting fixtures. 
 7


Commercial and industrial facilities in the United States employ a variety of lighting technologies, including HID, traditional fluorescents, LED and incandescent lighting fixtures. We estimate that approximately 25-30% of this market still utilizes inefficient high intensity discharge ("HID") lighting technologies. Our lighting systems typically replace less efficient HID, HIF fixtures, and earlier generation of LED fixtures. 
 Exterior Area lighting. Our market for area lighting includes parking garages, surface lots, automobile dealerships and gas service stations.
 We believe that utilities within the United States recognize the importance of energy efficiency as an economical means to manage capacity constraints and as a low-cost alternative when compared to the construction costs of building new power plants. Accordingly, many of these utilities are continually focused on demand reduction through energy efficiency. According to our research of individual state and utility programs, utilities design and fund programs that promote or deliver energy efficiency through legislation, regulation or voluntary action. Our product sales are not solely dependent upon these incentive programs, but we do believe that these incentive programs provide an important benefit as our customers evaluate their out-of-pocket cash investments.
Our Solution
 Value Proposition. We estimate our LED lighting systems generally reduce lighting-related electricity usage and costs by approximately 50% or greater, compared to legacy fixtures, while retaining the quantity of light, improving overall lighting quality and helping customers reduce their carbon footprint.
 Multi-Facility Roll-Out Capability. We offer our customers a single source, turnkey solution for project implementation in which we manage and maintain responsibility for entire multi-facility rollouts of our energy management solutions across North American commercial and industrial facility portfolios. This capability allows us to offer our customers an orderly, timely and scheduled process for recognizing energy reductions and cost savings.
 Rapid Payback Period. In most retrofit projects where we replace HID and HIF fixtures, our customers typically realize a one to four year, but most often 18 – 24 months, payback period on our lighting systems. These returns are achieved without considering utility incentives or government subsidies (although subsidies and incentives are continually being made available to our customers in connection with the installation of our systems that further shorten payback periods).
 Easy Installation, Implementation and Maintenance. Most of our fixtures are designed with a lightweight construction and modular plug-and-play architecture that allows for fast and easy installation, facilitates maintenance, and integration of other components of our energy management system. Our office LED Troffer Door Retrofit ("LDRTM") products are designed to allow for fast and easy installation without disrupting the ceiling space or the office workspace. We believe our system’s design reduces installation time and expense compared to other lighting solutions, which further improves our customers’ return on investment. We also believe that our use of standard components reduces our customers’ ongoing maintenance costs.
 Expanded Product Offerings. We are committed to continuing to develop LED product offerings in all of the markets we serve. Our third generation of ISON® class of LED interior fixture delivers a market leading up to 214 lumens per watt. This advancement means our customers can get more light with less energy, and sometimes fewer fixtures, than with any other product on the market. We have also recently launched a variety of new products, features and functionality targeting healthcare, food service, high and low temperature environments and other market segments. Our lighting products also may be configured to include IoT enabled control systems. In fiscal 2022, we introduced a product range under the brand PureMotion. These products circulate air for enhanced airflow, temperature comfort and energy savings. In addition, the PureMotion UVC products sanitize air in a safe UVC chamber that eliminates various airborne viruses, bacteria, mold and fungi. See "Products and Services" below.
 Environmental Benefits. By allowing for the permanent reduction of electricity consumption, we believe our energy management systems significantly reduce indirect CO2 emissions that are a negative by-product of energy generation which help enable our customers to achieve their sustainability, energy savings and carbon footprint reduction goals.

Our Competitive Strengths
 Compelling Value Proposition. By permanently reducing lighting-related electricity usage, our systems help enable our customers to achieve their sustainability, energy savings and carbon footprint reduction goals without compromising quantity and quality of light in their facilities. As a result, our products offer our customers a rapid return on their investment, without relying on government subsidies or utility incentives. 
 Comprehensive Project Management. We offer our customers a single source solution whereby we manage and are responsible for an entire retrofit lighting project, from initial site surveys and energy audits through to installation and controls integration and subsequent maintenance. Our ability to offer such comprehensive turnkey project management services, coupled with best-in-class customer service, allows us to deliver energy reductions and cost savings to our customers in timely, orderly and planned multi-facility rollouts nationwide. We believe one of our competitive advantages is our ability to deliver full turnkey LED lighting project capabilities. These turnkey services were the principal reason we achieved significant revenue growth in fiscal 2020 as we executed on our commitment to retrofit multiple locations for a major national account customer. This roll-out resumed in the second half of fiscal 2021 after a suspension in the first half of fiscal 2021 related to the COVID-19 pandemic response. Our success in the national account market segment centers on our turnkey design, engineering, manufacturing and project management capabilities and subsequent maintenance, which represent a very clear competitive advantage for us among large enterprises seeking to benefit from the illumination benefits and energy savings of LED lighting across locations nationwide. Few LED lighting providers are organized to serve every step of a custom retrofit project in a comprehensive, non-disruptive and timely fashion, from custom fixture design and initial site surveys to final installations. Incrementally, we are also able to help customers deploy state-of-the-art control systems that provide even greater long-term value from their lighting system investments.
 Large and Growing Customer Base. We have developed a large and growing national customer base and have installed our products in commercial and industrial facilities across North America. We believe that the willingness of our blue-chip customers to install our products across multiple facilities represents a significant endorsement of our value proposition, which in turn helps us sell our energy management systems to new customers. We intend to leverage our expertise in managing projects across multiple facilities within our new LED product markets, which now include new customer opportunities with banks, insurance companies, hospitals, fast food chains, retail storefronts, grocery and pharmacies. 
 Innovative Technology. We have developed a portfolio of United States patents primarily covering various elements of our products. We believe these innovations allow our products to produce more light output per unit of input energy compared to our competition. We also have patents pending that primarily cover various elements of our newly developed LED products and certain business methods. To complement our innovative energy management products, our integrated energy management services provide our customers with a turnkey solution either at a single facility or across their North American facility footprints. Our demonstrated ability to innovate provides us with significant competitive advantages. Our lighting products offer significantly more light output as measured in foot-candles of light delivered per watt of electricity consumed when compared to HID or traditional fluorescent fixtures. Beyond the benefits of our lighting fixtures, we believe that there is also an opportunity to utilize our system platform as a “connected ceiling” or “smart ceiling”, or a framework or network that can support the installation and integration of other solutions on a digital platform. This “smart ceiling” can be integrated with other technologies to collect data and manage assets and resources more efficiently. Orion’s percentage of systems utilizing IoT enabled devices has grown significantly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. Our “Industrial Internet of Things” or IoT enabled devices not only contain energy management control functions, but also have the ability to collect facility usage and traffic data as well as collect data from other facility mechanical systems, providing our customers with a path to digitization for their business operations.
 Expanded Sales and Distribution Network. In addition to selling directly to national accounts, electrical contractors and ESCOs, we sell our lighting products and services to electrical distributors through a North American network of independent lighting agencies. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we had 27 independent lighting agencies representing us in substantially all of North America. We intend to continue to selectively evaluate our sales network in the future, with a focus on geographic regions where we do not currently have a strong sales presence.
 Impact of COVID-19 in Fiscal 2022 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted business, trade, commerce, financial and credit markets, in the U.S. and globally. Our business was adversely impacted by measures taken by customers, suppliers, government entities and others to control the spread of 
 9


the virus beginning in March 2020 (the last few weeks of our 2020 fiscal year), and continuing most significantly into the second quarter of fiscal 2021. During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we experienced a rebound in business as project installations resumed for our largest customer. However, potential future risks remain due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not possible to predict the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, liquidity, capital resources or financial results, although the economic and regulatory impacts of COVID-19 significantly reduced our revenue and profitability in the first half of fiscal 2021. If the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more pronounced in our markets or experiences a resurgence in markets recovering from the spread of COVID-19, our results of operation would likely be materially adversely affected. 
 Our Growth Strategies
 In fiscal 2022, we continued to successfully capitalize on our capability of being a full service, turn-key provider of LED lighting and controls systems with design, build, installation and project management services, including being awarded large additional projects for a major national account. To build on this success, we are evolving our business strategy to further leverage this unique capability, while making targeted additions to the scope and nature of our products and services to enhance the value we can provide to our customers. In particular, we are working to develop recurring revenue streams, including lighting and electrical maintenance services, with an emphasis on utilizing control sensor technology to collect data and assist customers in the digitization of this data, along with other potential services. We also plan to expand our “smart-building” and “connected ceiling” IoT capabilities, along with related software and control technology products and services offerings. While we intend to pursue these expansion strategies organically, we also are actively exploring potential acquisitions that could accelerate our progress. Our ability to achieve our desired revenue and profitability goals depends on our ability to manage the adverse impact of COVID-19 and related supply chain disruptions and effectively execute on the following key strategic initiatives. 
 Focus on executing and marketing our turnkey LED retrofit capabilities to large national account customers. We believe one of our competitive advantages is our ability to deliver full turnkey LED lighting project capabilities starting with energy audits and site assessments that lead to custom engineering and manufacturing through to fully managed installations. These attributes coupled with our superior customer service, high quality designs and expedited delivery responsiveness resulted in our contract to retrofit multiple locations for a significant single national account beginning in fiscal 2020 that continued into fiscal 2022.Continue Product Innovation. We continue to innovate, developing lighting fixtures and features that address specific customer requirements, while also working to maintain a leadership position in energy efficiency, smart product design and installation benefits. For interior building applications, we recently expanded our product line to include a family of ceiling air movement solutions, some of which incorporate LED lighting and others which utilize ultraviolet C light waves to kill viruses, bacteria and germs. We also continue to deepen our capabilities in the integration of smart lighting controls. Our goal is to provide state-of-the-art lighting products with modular plug-and-play designs to enable lighting system customization from basic controls to advanced IoT capabilities. 
 Leverage Orion’s Smart Lighting Systems to Support Internet of Things Applications. We believe we are ideally positioned to help customers to efficiently deploy new IoT controls and applications by leveraging the “Smart Ceiling” capabilities of their Orion solid state lighting system. IoT capabilities can include the management and tracking of facilities, personnel, resources and customer behavior, driving both sales and lowering costs. As a result, these added capabilities provide customers an even greater return on investment from their lighting system and make us an even more attractive partner, providing our customers with a path to digitization for their business operations.
 Expand Maintenance Service Offerings. We believe we can leverage our construction management process expertise to develop a high-quality, quick-response, multi-location maintenance service offering. Our experience with large national customers and our large installed base of fixtures position us well to extend a maintenance offering to historical customers, as well as to new customers. Development of this recurring revenue stream is making progress and we believe there is significant market opportunity.
 Support success of our ESCO and agent driven distribution sales channels. We continue to focus on building our relationships and product and sales support for our ESCO and agent driven distribution channels. These efforts include an array of product and sales training efforts as well as the development of new products to cater to the unique needs of these sales channels.

Products and Services
 Our primary focus has been the sale of our LED lighting fixtures with integrated controls technology and related installation services. We will continue to focus on these products and services, as well as the development of a maintenance service offering. 
 Currently, most of our products are manufactured at our leased production facility location in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, although as the LED market continues to evolve, we also source products and components from third parties in order to have versatility in our product development. We are focused on researching, developing and/or acquiring new innovative LED products and technologies for the retrofit markets. We plan to continue developing creative new LED retrofit products in order to offer our customers a variety of integrated energy management services, such as system design, project management and installation.
 Products
 The following is a description of our primary products:
 Interior LED High Bay Fixtures: Our LED interior high bay lighting products consist of our Harris high bay, ApolloTM high bay and ISON® high bay products. Our ISON® class of LED interior fixture offers a full package of premium features, including low total cost of ownership, optics that currently exceed competitors in terms of lumen package, delivered light, modularity and advanced thermal management. Our third generation of ISON® class of LED interior fixture delivers up to an exceptional 214 lumens per watt. This advancement means our customers can get more light with less energy, and sometimes fewer fixtures, compared to other products on the market. Our ApolloTM class of LED interior fixtures is designed for new construction and retrofit projects where initial cost is the largest factor in the purchase decision. Our Harris high bay is ideal for customers seeking a cost-effective solution to deliver energy savings and maintenance reductions. In addition, our LED interior lighting products are lightweight and easy to handle, which further reduces installation and maintenance costs and helps to build brand loyalty with electrical contractors and installers.

 We also provide other services that comprise a small amount of our revenue. These services primarily include management and control of power quality and remote monitoring and control of our installed systems. We also sell and distribute replacement lamps and fixture components into the after-market.
 Our Customers
 We primarily target commercial, institutional and industrial customers who have warehousing, retail, manufacturing, and office facilities. In fiscal 2022, one customer accounted for 49.1% of our total revenue. In fiscal 2021, that same customer accounted for 56.0% of our total revenue, and in fiscal 2020, this same customer accounted for 74.1% of our total revenue. We expect that we will continue to experience significant customer concentration in fiscal 2023, but to a lesser degree than in the previous three years. While we continue to seek to diversify our customer base by expanding our reach to national accounts, ESCOs and the agent driven distribution channel, we expect to continue to derive a significant percentage of our revenue from contracts with one or a few customers. These contracts are entered into in the ordinary course of business and typically provide that we will deliver products and services on a work order or purchase order basis and any purchase order may be terminated prior to shipment. Our maintenance work orders or contracts may be for discrete projects or may have multi-year terms. These contracts generally do not guarantee that the customer will buy our products or services. 
 The amount and concentration of our revenues with one or more customer may fluctuate on a year to year or quarter to quarter basis depending on the number of purchase orders issued by our customers. The loss of a significant customer or the termination of a material volume of purchase orders (or the underlying agreements) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Sales and Marketing
 We sell our products in one of three ways: (i) directly through our relationships with our national account partners; (ii) indirectly through independent sales agencies and broadline North American distributors; and (iii) through ESCOs. Our ODS segment focuses on developing and expanding customer relationships with independent manufacturer’s sales agents and broadline distributors. As of the end of fiscal 2022 we had 27 independent lighting agencies representing us in substantially all of North America expanding our reach with broadline distributors. We attempt to leverage the customer relationships of these distributors to further extend the geographic scope of our selling efforts. We work cooperatively with our indirect channels through participation in national trade organizations and by providing training on our sales methodologies.
 We have historically focused our marketing efforts on traditional direct advertising, as well as developing brand awareness through customer education and active participation in trade shows and energy management seminars. These efforts have included participating in national, regional and local trade organizations, exhibiting at trade shows, executing targeted direct mail campaigns, advertising in select publications, public relations campaigns, social media and other lead generation and brand-building initiatives.

Competition
 The market for energy-efficient lighting products and services is fragmented. We face strong competition primarily from manufacturers and distributors of lighting products and services as well as electrical contractors. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, cost, performance, quality, customer experience, energy efficiency, customer service and marketing support.
 There are a number of lighting fixture manufacturers that sell LED and HIF products that compete with our lighting product lines. Lighting companies such as Acuity Brands, Inc., Signify Co., Cree, Inc., LSI Industries, Inc. and GE Current, a Daintree Company, are some of our main competitors within the commercial office, retail and industrial markets. We are also facing increased competition from manufacturers in low-cost countries.
 We also face competition from companies who provide energy management services. Some of these competitors, such as Ameresco, Inc., Johnson Controls International and Honeywell International, provide basic systems and controls designed to further energy efficiency.
 Intellectual Property
 As of March 31, 2022, we had been issued over 100 United States patents and have applied for a number of additional United States patents. The patented and patent pending technologies cover various innovative elements of our products, including our HIF and LED fixtures. Our patented LDRTM product allows for a significantly quicker installation when compared to competitor's commercial office lighting products. Our smart lighting controls allow our lighting fixtures to selectively provide a targeted amount of light where and when it is needed most.
 We believe that our patent portfolio as a whole is material to our business. We also believe that our patents covering our ability to manage the thermal and optical performance of our lighting products are material to our business, and that the loss of these patents could significantly and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.
 Backlog
 Backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize in the future as a result of firm, committed orders. Our backlog as of March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 totaled $10.1 million and $15.5 million, respectively. We generally expect our backlog to be recognized as revenue within one year, although the COVID-19 pandemic extended this time period.
Manufacturing and Distribution
 We lease an approximately 266,000 square foot primary manufacturing and distribution facility located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, where most of our products are manufactured. We utilize both solar and wind power to support the energy requirements for our manufacturing facility, allowing us to reduce our carbon footprint.
 We generally maintain a significant supply of raw material and purchased and manufactured component inventory. We contract with transportation companies to ship our products and manage all aspects of distribution logistics. We generally ship our products directly to the end user.
 Research and Development
 Our research and development efforts are centered on developing new LED products and technologies and enhancing existing products. The products, technologies and services we are developing are focused on increasing end user energy efficiency and enhancing lighting output. Over the last three fiscal years, we have focused our development on additional LED products, resulting in our development and commercialization of several new suites of LED interior high bay products.
 We operate research and development lab and test facilities in our Jacksonville, Florida and Manitowoc, Wisconsin locations.
 13


Regulatory Matters
 Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to water, the remediation of contaminated properties and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of, and exposure to, waste and other materials, as well as laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. We believe that our business, operations, and facilities are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.
 State, county or municipal statutes often require that a licensed electrician be present and supervise each retrofit project. Further, all installations of electrical fixtures are subject to compliance with electrical codes in virtually all jurisdictions in the United States. In cases where we engage independent contractors to perform our retrofit projects, we believe that compliance with these laws and regulations is the responsibility of the applicable contractor.
 Our Corporate and Other Available Information
 We were incorporated as a Wisconsin corporation in April 1996 and our corporate headquarters are located at 2210 Woodland Drive, Manitowoc, Wisconsin 54220. Our Internet website address is www.orionlighting.com. Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, are available through the investor relations page of our internet website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. We are not including the information contained on our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this report.
Human Capital
 As of March 31, 2022, we had approximately 314 full-time employees. We also employ temporary employees in our manufacturing facility as demand requires, at times in excess of 100 temporary employees. Our employees are not represented by any labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike due to employee relations.
 We are an employee-centric organization, maintaining a safe and respectful environment that provides opportunity for our employees.
 We believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. We pay our employees competitively and offer a broad range of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive with others in our industry.
 We are committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our management teams and all of our employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. We will not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any form. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required annual training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination.
 At times during fiscal 2022, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to implement safety protocols and procedures to protect our employees and our customers. These protocols included limiting travel, restricting access to our facilities along with monitoring processes, physical distancing, physical barriers, enhanced cleaning procedures, and requiring face coverings. In addition, we modified the way we conducted many aspects of our business to reduce the number of in-person interactions. For example, we significantly expanded the use of virtual interactions in all aspects of our business, including customer facing activities. Many of our administrative and operational functions during this time required modification as well, including most of our professional workforce working remotely. We expanded paid time-off for employees impacted by COVID-19 and provided increased pay for certain employees involved in critical infrastructure who could not work remotely. We expect to continue implement such safety and wellness measures as government authorities may require or recommend or as we may determine to be in the best interest of our employees, clients, vendors and shareholders.
