Overview
 Alico is an agribusiness with a legacy of achievement and innovation in citrus and conservation. The Company owns approximately 74,000 acres of land in eight Florida counties (Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands and Polk), and approximately 90,000 acres of mineral rights throughout Florida. Alico holds these mineral rights on substantially all its owned acres, with additional mineral rights on other acres. Our principal lines of business are citrus groves and land management.
 Alico is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States of America.
 Alico, Inc. operates two divisions: Alico Citrus, a citrus producer on its own land and as a manager of citrus groves for third parties, and Land Management and Other Operations, which includes land conservation, encompassing environmental services, land leasing and related support operations.
 The Company manages its land based upon its primary usage and reviews its performance based upon two primary classifications - Alico Citrus and Land Management and Other Operations. The Alico Citrus division includes the production, cultivation and sale of citrus on its owned lands and as a manager of citrus groves for third parties. Land Management and Other Operations include leases for grazing rights, hunting leases, a farm lease, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine, leases of oil extraction rights to third parties, and other miscellaneous operations generating income. Alico presents its financial results and the related discussion based upon its two business segments: (i) Alico Citrus and (ii) Land Management and Other Operations.
 Recent Developments
 Hurricane Ian
 
On September 28, 2022, Hurricane Ian made landfall on the southwest coast of Florida and a majority of the Company’s groves were impacted by the storm. The full impact of Hurricane Ian on Alico’s operations is still being assessed at this time, but we believe the lessons learned over the past 124 years, especially since Hurricane Irma in 2017, allowed us to be better prepared prior to landfall and to begin recovery more rapidly after impact. The implementation of our disaster programs, our dedicated workforce, and experienced management appear to have limited the damage to our properties. Our approximately 48,900 gross acres of citrus groves, which are in Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands and Polk Counties, sustained hurricane, or tropical storm force winds for varying durations of time. Based upon ongoing field assessment, the Company has identified significant fruit drop since the impact of the storm.
 
While we lost a small percentage of trees, the force and duration of the storm impacted the majority of the groves. Based upon prior experience with serious storms of this nature, we expect it will take up to two full seasons or more for the groves to recover to pre-hurricane production levels. We maintain crop insurance and are working closely with our insurers and adjusters to evaluate and determine the amount of insurance recovery we may be entitled to, if any. We are also working with Florida Citrus Mutual, the industry trade group, and government agencies on securing potential federal relief programs.
 


Departure and Appointment of Chief Financial Officer
   On May 17, 2022, Richard Rallo notified the Company of his decision to resign from his role as the Company’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer) effective as of May 31, 2022. Mr. Rallo’s decision to resign was for personal reasons to eliminate extensive travel and/or avoid relocation to Florida and was not related to any disagreement with the Company or its independent registered public accountants on any matter relating to the Company’s financial or accounting operations, policies, or practices. Mr. Rallo has agreed to provide consulting services to the Company through December 31, 2022 and has been providing such services.
On September 6, 2022, the Company announced the appointment of Perry G. Del Vecchio, age 55, as the Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer) of the Company, effective as of September 6, 2022. Mr. Del Vecchio is responsible for all corporate finance, treasury and accounting functions of the Company and reports directly to John Kiernan, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer.
   Employment and Bonus Agreement
    On April 1, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with John E. Kiernan (the “Employment Agreement”). At the same time, the Company and Mr. Kiernan entered into an annual performance and long-term bonus agreement (the “Bonus Agreement”). Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, Mr. Kiernan will remain President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, for a term commencing on April 1, 2022, and ending on September 30, 2024, subject to extension and termination pursuant to the provisions of the Employment Agreement. The Bonus Agreement sets forth the terms under which Mr. Kiernan would be eligible and entitled to short-term and long-term incentive cash and equity bonuses. For further details of this Employment and Bonus Agreement, please see the Form 8-K filed by the Company on April 5, 2022.
Termination of the Citrus Grove Management Agreement
    In June 2022, the Company was notified by a primary group of third-party grove owners, who are affiliated with each other (collectively, the “Grove Owners”) and for which the Company was managing groves that the Grove Owners were terminating the management relationship under a certain property management agreement dated as of July 16, 2020 (the “Property Management Agreement”) with the Company as the Grove Owners decided to exit the citrus business. As a result, all services relating to this caretaking management initiative and the accompanying management fee and reimbursed costs associated with performing caretaking management services have ceased as of June 10, 2022.
The COVID-19 Pandemic
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current novel coronavirus outbreak (“COVID-19”) to be a global pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States, federal, state and local governments throughout the country have imposed varying degrees of restrictions on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. These measures have had a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the economy, including certain agriculture businesses. While epidemiological conditions in the United States have improved as of September 30, 2022, and most of the restrictions on social and commercial activity have been relaxed, a resurgence of the virus could cause epidemiological and macroeconomic conditions to deteriorate and more severe restrictions to be put in place. It is not possible for the Company to predict the duration or magnitude of any adverse effects due to a resurgence at this time. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Prepayment and Restructure of Fixed-Rate Term Loans
 On April 29, 2022, the Company made a prepayment on one of its Met Variable-Rate Term Loans in an amount of approximately $15,625,000 and the loan, after also considering a final scheduled principal payment made on May 2, 2022, was fully satisfied.
 Sales of Land
 
On May 31, 2022, the Company sold approximately 400 acres of Alico Ranch to a third party for approximately $1,900,000 and recognized a gain of $1,700,000.

During the month of April 2022, the Company sold approximately 788 acres from the Alico Ranch to third parties for approximately $4,100,000 and recognized a gain of approximately $3,900,000. One of these sales transactions, consisting of approximately 142 acres, was sold to an employee of the Company for approximately $651,000.
 
On March 15, 2022, the Company sold approximately 6,286 acres of Alico Ranch to third parties at an average sales price of $4,500 per acre, realizing approximately $28,288,000 of gross proceeds.



On December 3, 2021, the State of Florida purchased, under the Florida Forever program, approximately 1,638 acres of the Alico Ranch for approximately $5,675,000 pursuant to an option agreement entered into between the State of Florida and the Company. The Company recognized a gain of approximately $5,570,000.
    During November 2021, the Company sold approximately 302 acres from the Alico Ranch to various third parties for approximately $1,458,000 and recognized a gain of approximately $1,400,000.

Federal Relief Program – Hurricane Ian
 
It remains unclear whether there may be Hurricane Ian federal relief programs and, if available, the extent to which the Company will be eligible. The Company intends to take advantage of any such available programs as and when they become available. The Company is currently working with Florida Citrus Mutual, the industry trade group, and government agencies on federal relief programs.
Federal Relief Program – Hurricane Irma
 
The Company was eligible for Hurricane Irma federal relief programs for block grants that were being administered through the State of Florida. The Company has received a total of approximately $25,600,000 in Hurricane Irma federal relief for the period ended September 30, 2019 through September 30, 2022. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company received approximately $1,123,000, $4,299,000 and $4,629,000, respectively, under the Florida Citrus Recovery Block Grant (“CRBG”) program. These federal relief proceeds are included as a reduction to operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Land We Manage
 We regularly review our land-holdings to determine the best use of each parcel based upon our management expertise. Our total return profile is a combination of operating income potential and long-term appreciation. Land holdings not meeting our total return criteria are considered surplus to our operations and efforts are being made to sell such land holdings or to exchange such land holdings for land considered to be more compatible with our business objectives and total return profile, or to lease such land holdings.
 Our land holdings and the operating activities in which we engage are categorized in the following table:
 

 | Gross Acreage | | Operating Activities 
Alico Citrus | | | 
Citrus Groves | | 48,845 | | Citrus Cultivation 
Citrus Nursery | 22 | | Citrus Tree Development
 | | 48,867 | | 
Land Management and Other Operations | | | 
Ranch | | 24,161 | | Leasing and Conservation
Other Land | | 526 | | Mining Lease and Office 
 | | 24,687 | | 
Total | | 73,554 | | 

Alico Citrus
 
We own and manage citrus land in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties in the State of Florida and engage in the cultivation of citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the fresh and processed citrus markets. Alico citrus groves total 48,867 gross acres or 66.4% of our land holdings.
   Termination of the Citrus Grove Management Agreement
    In June 2022 the Company was notified by the Grove Owners, for which the Company was managing groves, that the Grove Owners were terminating the management relationship under the Property Management Agreement with the Company as the Grove Owners decided to exit the citrus business.
   Citrus Land Lease
    6


The Company signed three agreements to lease approximately 2,100 of these citrus acres from the Grove Owners and thus have the rights to citrus production on such leased acreage for a one-year term at a cost of approximately $157,000. Additionally, on the same terms and conditions, the Company has the right to extend two of these leases representing approximately 1,600 acres for two one-year periods and has the right to extend the third lease with a one-year option. These leases expand the Company’s citrus production acreage by approximately 6% to approximately 36,000 net citrus acres.
Our citrus acreage is further detailed in the following table:
 

 | Net Plantable | | | | | | | 
 | Producing | | Developing | | | Fallow | | Total NetPlantable | | Support& Other | | | Gross | 
DeSoto County | | 16,232 | | | 115 | | | 522 | | | 16,869 | | | | 4,623 | | 21,492
Polk County | | 4,870 | | | — | | | — | | | 4,870 | | | | 2,237 | | 7,107 
Collier County | | 4,261 | | | — | | | — | | | 4,261 | | | | 2,905 | | 7,166 
Hendry County | | 5,735 | | | 57 | | | 175 | | | 5,967 | | | | 2,799 | | 8,766 
Charlotte County | | 1,724 | | | — | | | 138 | | | 1,862 | | | 676 | | 2,538 | 
Highlands County | | 1,063 | | | — | | | — | | | 1,063 | | | 161 | | 1,224 | 
Hardee County | 403 | | | — | | | — | | 403 | | | 171 | | | 574 
Total | | 34,288 | | | 172 | | | 835 | | | 35,295 | | | | 13,572 | | 48,867

 
Of the 48,867 gross acres of citrus land we own and manage, 13,572 acres are classified as support and other acreage. Support and other acreage include acres used for roads, barns, water detention, water retention and drainage ditches integral to the cultivation of citrus trees, but which are not capable of directly producing fruit. In addition, we own a small citrus tree nursery consisting of approximately 22 acres and utilize the trees produced in this nursery in our own operations. The 35,295 remaining acres are classified as net plantable acres. Net plantable acres are those that are capable of directly producing fruit. These include acres that are currently producing, acres that are developing (i.e., acres that are planted with trees too young to commercially produce fruit) and acres that are fallow.
    In an effort to increase the density of our citrus groves, Alico has planted approximately 1,900,000 new trees since 2017. This level of planting has been substantially higher than the normal level of tree attrition. We will continue to evaluate the density throughout our groves and determine the appropriate tree plantings moving forward. Typically, citrus trees become fruit bearing approximately four to five years after planting and peak around seven to eight years after planting.
    Our Alico Citrus business segment cultivates citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the processed and fresh citrus markets. Our sales to the processed market were approximately 84.5%, 82.7%, and 91.0% of Alico Citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The overall decrease in sales to processed markets as a percentage of citrus revenues during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 as compared to such percentage for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, was due to revenues generated under an agreement entered into on July 16, 2020 with a group of third-party grove owners (“Grove Owners”), who are affiliated with each other, to provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services (“Grove Management Services”) for approximately 7,000 acres owned by the Grove Owners. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company was reimbursed by the Grove Owners for all its costs incurred related to providing these Grove Management Services and received a management fee based on acres covered under this agreement. The Company recorded both an increase in revenues and expenses when the Company provided these Grove Management Services. In June 2022, the Company was notified by the Grove Owners that they were exiting the citrus business and the management relationship under the Property Management Agreement with the Company. As a result, all services relating to this caretaking management initiative and the accompanying management fee and reimbursed costs associated with performing caretaking management services ceased on June 10, 2022. The management fee was paid through June 30, 2022. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, under this agreement, the Company recorded approximately $10,598,000 of operating revenue relating to these Grove Management Services, including the management fee. Excluding these revenues for these citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services, revenue to processed markets represents approximately 92.7% of total citrus revenues.
 The average pound solids per box was 5.28, 5.66, and 5.96 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 We generally use multi-year contracts with citrus processors that include pricing structures based on a floor and ceiling price. Therefore, if pricing in the market is favorable relative to our floor price, we benefit from the incremental difference between the floor and the final market price to the extent it does not exceed the ceiling price.
 Our citrus produced for the processed citrus market in fiscal year 2022 under our largest agreement was subject to floor prices and ceiling prices. Under this agreement, if the market price was below the floor prices or exceeded the ceiling prices, then 50% of the shortfall or excess was
7


deducted from the floor price or added to the ceiling price. Under our next largest agreement, our citrus produced is subject to a minimum floor price and maximum ceiling price and is based on a cost-plus structure.
On each of May 18, 2020 and May 20, 2020, the Company entered into two new agreements to supply Tropicana, its largest customer, with citrus fruit. These new agreements were effective October 1, 2020, expire on July 31, 2024, and succeeded our existing largest agreement with this customer which expired at the end of September 2020.
 Although we believe other markets and customers are available for our citrus products, we also believe that new arrangements in these other markets or with other customers may be less favorable than our current contracts.
Our sales to the fresh citrus market constituted approximately 1.4%, 0.6%, and 2.6% of our Alico Citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We produce numerous varieties for the fresh fruit market including grapefruit, navel and other fresh varieties. Generally, our fresh fruit is sold to packing houses by the box and the packing houses are responsible for the harvest and haul of these boxes. We produced approximately 91,000, 61,000, and 267,000 fresh fruit boxes for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
On July 16, 2020, the Company executed a Property Management Agreement with the Grove Owners to provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services (“Grove Management Services”) for approximately 7,000 acres owned by such third parties. Under the terms of the Property Management Agreement, the Company was reimbursed by the Grove Owners for all of its costs incurred related to providing these services and also received a management fee based on acres covered under this Property Management Agreement. In August 2021, one of the affiliates from the Grove Owners purchased approximately 900 acres, which was in addition to the acres then receiving Grove Management Services. In June 2022, the Company was notified by the Grove Owners that they were exiting the citrus business and the management relationship under the Property Management Agreement with the Company. As a result, all services relating to this caretaking management initiative and the accompanying management fee and reimbursed costs associated with performing caretaking management services ceased on June 10, 2022. The management fee was paid through June 30, 2022. The Company, prior to this agreement, was already providing grove management services to several small third-party grove-owners on acres within the Company’s groves and continues to provide such services. Revenues generated from our grove management services were approximately 13.3%, 16.1%, and 5.1% of our total citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
    On October 30, 2020, the Company purchased approximately 3,280 gross acres located in Hendry County for a purchase price of $18,230,000. This acquisition allows the Company to add additional scale to its then approximately 46,000 gross acres of citrus properties. Strategically, with these acquired groves neighboring existing Alico groves, Alico believes that this acquisition will help Alico with its operation designed to be a low-cost, high-producing citrus grower.
 
Revenues from our Alico Citrus operations were approximately 97.5%, 97.5%, and 96.6% of our total operating revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
Land Management and Other Operations
 
We own and manage land in Collier, Glades, and Hendry Counties and are engaged in land leasing for recreational and grazing purposes, conservation, and mining activities. Our Land Management and Other Operations land holdings total 24,687 gross acres, or 33.6% of our total acreage.
 Our Land Management and Other Operations acreage is detailed in the following table as of September 30, 2022:
 

 | Acreage | 
Hendry County | | 20,139
Glades County | 526 | 
Collier County | | 4,022 
Total | | 24,687

 
On May 31, 2022, the Company sold approximately 400 acres of Alico Ranch to a third party for approximately $1,900,000 and recognized a gain of $1,700,000.
 
During the month of April, the Company sold approximately 788 acres from the Alico Ranch to third parties for approximately $4,100,000 and recognized a gain of approximately $3,900,000. One of these sales transactions, consisting of approximately 142 acres, was sold to an employee of the Company for approximately $651,000.
      
On March 15, 2022, the Company sold approximately 6,286 acres from the Alico Ranch to third parties for approximately $28,288,000 and recognized a gain of approximately $26,554,000.

On December 3, 2021, the State of Florida purchased, under the Florida Forever program, approximately 1,638 acres of the Alico Ranch for approximately $5,675,000 pursuant to an option agreement entered into between the State of Florida and the Company. The Company recognized a gain of approximately $5,570,000. This is the third sales transaction we have completed with the State of Florida within the last three years, aggregating over 18,000 acres, including the April 15, 2021 sale and the September 2020 sale described below.

During November 2021, the Company sold approximately 302 acres from the Alico Ranch to various third parties for approximately $1,458,000 and recognized a gain of approximately $1,400,000.

On June 3, 2021, the Company sold approximately 11,700 acres, which were encumbered by an easement, to a third-party for approximately $12,219,000. In 2013, these acres were enrolled in the Wetlands Reserve Program (“WRP”), which calls for the restoration and maintenance of the property for the duration of the WRP easement. As part of that enrollment in 2013, Alico received approximately $1,800 per acre.

On April 15, 2021, the State of Florida purchased, under the Florida Forever program, approximately 5,734 acres of Alico Ranch for approximately $14,445,000, pursuant to an option agreement between the State of Florida and Alico dated December 15, 2020. Alico used most of the net sales proceeds to prepay a portion of its fixed-rate term debt.
 
On September 10, 2020, the Company sold approximately 10,700 acres on the western part of Alico Ranch to the State of Florida. Because the acres involved in the sale would have been critical to our planned dispersed water storage project, the Company has decided to no longer pursue permit approval activities for this project from that point forward. As a result of this decision to no longer pursue permit approval activities for this project, the Company has renamed this segment Land Management and Other Operations to better reflect the components of this segment. The Company did not ever get to the point where it was generating any revenue from the dispersed water storage project and incurred expenses of $0, $0, and $1,346,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
On March 27, 2020, the Company sold certain sections at the East Ranch for approximately $2,980,000 and realized a gain of approximately $2,748,000. The Company subsequently used substantially all of the net cash proceeds to purchase a like-kind asset in May 2020, which has allowed the Company to defer substantially all of the tax impact of the gain on sale of this ranch land.
 Revenues from Land Management and Other Operations were approximately 2.5%, 2.5%, and 3.4% of total operating revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 Our Strategy
 Our core business strategy is to maximize stockholder value through continuously improving the return on our invested capital, either by holding and managing our existing land through skilled agricultural production, leasing, or other opportunistic means of monetization, disposing of under productive land or business units and acquiring new land or operations with appreciation potential.
 Our objectives are to produce the highest quality agricultural products, create innovative land uses, opportunistically acquire and convert undervalued assets, sell under-productive land and other assets not meeting our total return profile, generate recurring and sustainable profit with the appropriate balance of risk and reward, and exceed the expectations of stockholder, customers, clients and partners.
 Our strategy is based on best-management practices of our agricultural operations and the environmental and conservation stewardship of our land and natural resources. We try to manage our land in a sustainable manner and evaluate the effect of changing land uses while considering new opportunities. Our commitment to environmental stewardship is fundamental to the Company’s core beliefs.
 Intellectual Property
 While we consider our various intellectual property to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single piece of intellectual property or group of related intellectual property registrations or rights.
Seasonal Nature of Business
 As with any agribusiness enterprise, our agribusiness operations and revenues are predominantly seasonal in nature. The following table illustrates the seasonality of our agribusiness revenues:
 

 | Fiscal Year 
 | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 
 | Ending 12/31 | Ending 3/31 | Ending 6/30 | Ending 9/30
 | Oct | Nov | Dec | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sept

Harvest Valencia Oranges | | | | | | X | X | X | X | | | 

Significant Customers
 Revenue from Tropicana represented approximately 79.7%, 77.5%, and 86.9% of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The revenue in fiscal year 2022 from Tropicana was generated primarily from two separate contracts. This revenue was generated from the sale of our citrus product in the processed market. No other single customer provided more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal years 2022, 2021 or 2020.
 
The slight increase in the Tropicana revenue, as a percentage of sales, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 is primarily due to the Grove Owners in June 2022 terminating the management relationship under the Property Management Agreement with the Company. The decrease in Tropicana revenue, as a percentage of sales, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 was expected and attributable to an increase in overall sales generated from the agreement entered into in July 2020 with the Grove Owners to provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services for approximately 7,000 acres owned by the Grove Owners. Under the terms of the Property Management Agreement, the Company was reimbursed by the third parties for all its costs incurred related to providing these services and received a management fee based on acres covered under this agreement. The Company recorded both an increase in sales revenue and an increase in expenses as and when the Company provided these citrus grove caretaking management services. Revenue from Tropicana represents approximately 90.1% of total revenues when excluding these grove caretaking services for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.
 Competition
 The orange and specialty citrus markets are intensely competitive, but no single producer has any significant market power over any market segments, as is consistent with the production of most agricultural commodities. Citrus is grown domestically in several states including Florida, California, Arizona, and Texas, as well as foreign countries, most notably Brazil and Mexico. Competition is impacted by several factors including quality, production, demand, brand recognition, market prices, weather, disease, export/import restrictions and foreign currency exchange rates.
 Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
 
Alico is an agricultural company which, based upon its rich heritage and traditions, seeks not only to maximize value for its customers and stockholders, but also to enhance its legacy by employing sustainable practices in all aspects of operations including stewardship of both its natural and human resources. The Company recognizes the increased emphasis by stockholders, business partners and other key constituents in recent years on ESG programs that are embedded into day-to-day business policies and practices. The Company is proud of its commitment to doing the right thing for communities, the environment, and its employees.
Governmental Regulations
 Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. Management believes we are in material compliance with all such rules including permitting and reporting requirements. Historically, compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every reasonable effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. In addition, we require in our leases that lessees of our property comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing.
 We are subject to other laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies within the United States, which may differ among jurisdictions. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods.


Human Capital Management
 
Purpose and Company Values
 
Supporting our people is a fundamental value for Alico. We believe the Company’s success depends on its ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees and the employees of our independent contractors significantly benefit our operations and performance. The Company's management oversees various employee initiatives and also monitors the effectiveness of the personnel provided by independent contractors with which we contract for certain harvesting and hauling services.
Employees
 
We believe in a culture of equity, diversity and inclusion. We are also committed to advancing safe and respectful work environments where our employees are invited to bring their talents, backgrounds and expertise to bear on the success of our business and where every person has the opportunity to thrive personally and professionally.
Hiring, Development and Retention
 
Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and consider the services that are provided for us by our independent contractors. We rely on our independent contractors to manage their respective employee levels so that the harvesting and hauling services they are obligated to perform for us are consistent with the contractual obligations of these independent contractors and enable us to satisfy our harvesting and hauling needs. Management believes that through its own employees, coupled with the human capital supplied by its independent contractors, it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable, that its relations with its independent contractors is favorable, and that the relations that the independent contractors and the Company have with the employees of the independent contractors is favorable.
 
Employee Safety and Well-Being
 
Health and safety in the workplace for our employees and personnel provided by independent contractors with which we contract is one of the Company’s core values. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. In order to support and enhance health and safety practices, the Company routinely conducts safety training with employees to emphasize safety when conducting grove caretaking, general employee health, proper equipment operating techniques, office ergonomics and other important safety topics. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees and the personnel provided by independent contractors safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect its workforce so that its workforce can more safely and effectively perform their work.
 
Inclusion and Diversity
 People are critical to our efforts to drive growth and deliver value for stockholders. One of the ways we have put people at the center is by continuing to work toward a more inclusive and diverse workplace where each person feels respected, valued and seen and can be the best version of themselves – from women and ethnically diverse employees to veterans, among others. With employees, management and directors representing the diversity around the world, the Company can access stronger insights into different cultures and backgrounds, which ultimately helps the Company to better operate the business.

As of September 30, 2022, ethnically diverse employees represent 73% of the Company’s Citrus operations, 32% of Corporate, General, Administrative and Other. Women made up 22% of the Company’s Corporate, General, Administrative and Other and 22% of the Company’s Citrus operations.

Ms. English’s appointment is part of the Company’s commitment to promote diversity and inclusion.
