Segments Overview
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, Adtalem made a change to its reportable segments to align with current strategic priorities and resource allocation.
Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, Adtalem eliminated its Financial Services segment when ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine were classified as discontinued operations and assets held for sale. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we have classified the ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine entities as “Held for Sale” and “Discontinued Operations” in all periods presented as applicable. As a result, all financial results, disclosures, and discussions of continuing operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K exclude ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine operations, unless otherwise noted. In addition, we continue to incur costs associated with ongoing litigation and settlements related to the DeVry University divestiture, which was completed during fiscal year 2019, and are classified as expense within discontinued operations. See Note 4 “Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional discontinued operations information.
We present three reportable segments as follows:
Chamberlain – Offers degree and non-degree programs in the nursing and health professions postsecondary education industry. This segment includes the operations of Chamberlain University (“Chamberlain”).
Walden – Offers more than 100 online certificate, bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees, including those in nursing, education, counseling, business, psychology, public health, social work and human services, public administration and public policy, and criminal justice. This segment includes the operations of Walden, which was acquired by Adtalem on August 12, 2021. See Note 3 “Acquisitions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information on the acquisition.
Medical and Veterinary – Offers degree and non-degree programs in the medical and veterinary postsecondary education industry. This segment includes the operations of the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (“AUC”), Ross University School of Medicine (“RUSM”), and Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine (“RUSVM”), which are collectively referred to as the “medical and veterinary schools.”
“Home Office and Other” includes activities not allocated to a reportable segment. Financial and descriptive information about Adtalem’s reportable segments is presented in Note 21 “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Chamberlain
Chamberlain was founded in 1889 as Deaconess College of Nursing and acquired by Adtalem in 2005. In May 2017, Chamberlain College of Nursing broadened its reach in healthcare education through the establishment of Chamberlain University and now offers its programs through its College of Nursing and College of Health Professions. Nursing degree offerings include a three-year onsite and online Bachelor of Science in Nursing (“BSN”) degree, an online Registered Nurse (“RN”) to BSN (“RN-to-BSN”) degree completion option, an online Master of Science in Nursing (“MSN”) degree, including Family Nurse Practitioner (“FNP”) and other specialties, and the online Doctor of Nursing Practice (“DNP”) degree.
Chamberlain offers an online Master of Public Health (“MPH”) degree program and an online Master of Social Work (“MSW”) degree program, which launched in July 2017 and September 2019, respectively, both of which are offered through its College of Health Professions. Chamberlain is also enrolling new students for its Master of Physician Assistant Studies (“MPAS”) degree program, offered at the Chicago, Illinois campus, with the first cohort scheduled to begin classes in September 2022.
 Chamberlain provides an educational experience distinguished by a high level of care for students, academic excellence, and integrity delivered through its 23 campuses and online. Chamberlain is committed to graduating health professionals who are empowered to transform healthcare worldwide. Chamberlain had 32,891 students enrolled in the May 2022 session, a decrease of 5.8% compared to the prior year.

Chamberlain’s pre-licensure BSN degree is a baccalaureate program offered at its campus locations as well as online in specific states. The BSN program enables students to complete their BSN degree in three years of full-time study as opposed to the typical four-year BSN program with summer breaks. Beginning in September 2019, Chamberlain also began offering an evening/weekend BSN option at select campuses. In September 2020, Chamberlain launched its online BSN option which offers a blend of flexibility, interactivity, and experiential learning. The program is available to students living in 18 states (Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin). Chamberlain pre-licensure BSN students who completed the National Council Licensure Examination (“NCLEX”) had an overall pass rate of 85% in 2021 and 91% in 2020. The national NCLEX pass rate was 86% for 2021 and 90% for 2020.
 Students who already have passed their NCLEX exam and achieved RN designation through a diploma or associate degree can complete their BSN degree online through Chamberlain’s RN-to-BSN completion option in three semesters of full-time study, although most students enroll part-time while they continue working as nurses.
The online MSN degree program offers five non-direct-care specialty tracks: Educator, Executive, Informatics, Population Health, and Healthcare Policy. These programs require 36 credit hours and 144 to 217 practicum hours and are designed to be completed in approximately two years of part-time study. The accelerated MSN program offers an advanced generalist and clinical nursing leadership (“CNL”) concentration. The advanced generalist concentration requires 30 credit hours and 144 practicum hours designed to be completed in as little as nine months of full-time study. The CNL concentration requires 36 credit hours and 432 practicum hours designed to be completed in one year of full-time study. The accelerated RN-to-MSN program offers associate or diploma-prepared RNs an opportunity to earn an MSN versus a BSN with the option of completing the advanced generalist concentration requiring 45 credit hours and 144 practicum hours completed in one year of full-time study and the CNL concentration requires 52 credit hours and 432 practicum hours completed in one and a half years of full-time study.
Chamberlain also offers four direct-care nurse practitioner tracks: FNP, Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (“AGACNP”), Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner (“AGPCNP”), and Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (“PMHNP”). The FNP and AGPCNP programs require 45 credit hours and 650 lab and clinical hours and are designed to be completed in two and a half years of part-time study. The AGACNP program requires 48 credit hours and 750 lab and clinical hours, while the PMHNP program requires 47 credit hours and 650 lab and clinical hours, with both concentrations designed to be completed in two and a half years of part-time study. The AGPCNP and AGACNP programs launched in July 2020. The PMHNP program launched in November 2021.
The online DNP degree program is based on the eight essentials of doctoral education outlined by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (“AACN”). The DNP program is designed for nurses seeking a terminal degree in nursing and offers an alternative to research-focused Ph.D. programs. The program requires 32 to 40 credit hours along with 1,024 clinical practicum hours. The program can be completed in five to six semesters of study.
Chamberlain’s College of Health Professions MPH degree program focuses on preparing students to become public health practitioners to work with communities and populations globally to promote healthy communities and to prevent community health problems such as disease, poverty, health access disparities, and violence through interdisciplinary coursework. The program requires 43 credit hours. The MSW degree program aims to develop and empower students to be agents of social change in their communities and throughout the world. The MSW degree program prepares students for generalist or specialized practice and offers three tracks, including Crisis and Response Interventions, Trauma, and Medical Social Work. The program offers both a traditional and advanced standing option. The traditional option requires 60 credit hours while the advanced standing option requires 36 credit hours and is for students who have completed a baccalaureate degree in social work. The MPAS degree program prepares students for the practice of general medicine in collaboration with a licensed physician and healthcare team. The program requires 109 credit hours, including 1,440 of direct patient care and is designed to be completed in two years.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bachelor of Science in Nursing
All applicants are required to have an associate degree or diploma in nursing and a valid RN license.
Walden Undergraduate Academy
The Academy is a general education program of study for first-time undergraduates who do not have any college credit prior to coming to Walden. Students take their courses as a cohort in a lock-step manner. This does not change the 181-quarterly credit model for undergraduate programs, nor does it impact available concentrations. Instead, the lock-step nature of the general education curriculum provides additional support to students as they build their scholarly acumen.
Master’s and Master’s Certificate
The Master’s program requires a minimum grade point average of 2.5 in bachelor’s degree coursework or a 3.0 in master’s degree coursework. Specific program requirements may apply.
Master of Science in Nursing
Two tracks are offered to licensed RNs who seek to enter the MSN program. The BSN track is for students with a BSN degree. The RN track is for students with an associate degree in nursing or a diploma in nursing that has prepared them for licensure as a RN. RN-to-MSN applications will not be accepted without a nursing degree or diploma conferred.
Master of Social Work
Walden offers three tracks for the MSW program. The traditional option may be the best fit for students looking to balance studies with work, family, and other responsibilities. The traditional fast track option is for students that want an intensive workload and have sufficient time to dedicate to their studies. The advanced standing option is for students that hold a Bachelor of Social Work (“BSW”) degree from a Council on Social Work Education (“CSWE”) accredited program and graduated with a minimum grade point average of 3.0. This option allows students to skip foundational courses and start their MSW with advanced-level courses.

EdD Educational Administration & Leadership (for administrators)
Because of its unique structure, the Doctor of Education (“EdD”) with a specialization in Educational Administration and Leadership (for Administrators) has additional admission requirements, including a master’s degree or education specialist degree and a minimum of 25 quarter credits or 15 semester credits from a university principal preparation program. These may have been acquired through a master’s, specialist, or certification program at a university. A valid principal license, or eligibility for a principal license based on a university principal preparation program, is also required. If not certified, applicants should provide a university document that states eligibility for certification based on the 

7



program. Additionally, applicants must have had three years of administrative experience and must provide an acknowledgement form verifying they have access to and the ability to collect data from a K–12 school setting.
Ph.D. in Public Health
Walden offers two tracks for applicants. Applicants are eligible for track 1 if they have a MPH or a MS in Public Health. Applicants are eligible for track 2 if they have a bachelor’s degree or higher in an academic discipline other than the public health field.
Post-Master’s Certificate
A minimum grade point average of 3.0 in post-bachelor’s degree coursework and three years of professional/academic experience related to the program for which application is made.
Medical and Veterinary
Together, the three schools, along with the Medical Education Readiness Program (“MERP”) and the Veterinary Preparation Program, had 5,304 students enrolled in the May 2022 semester, a 3.5% increase compared to the same term last year.
AUC
AUC, founded in 1978 and acquired by Adtalem in 2011, provides medical education and confers the Doctor of Medicine degree. AUC is located in St. Maarten and is one of the most established international medical schools in the Caribbean, producing over 7,500 graduates from over 78 countries. The mission of AUC is to train tomorrow’s physicians, whose service to their communities and their patients is enhanced by international learning experiences, a diverse learning community, and an emphasis on social accountability and engagement. 
RUSM
RUSM, founded in 1978 and acquired by Adtalem in 2003, provides medical education and confers the Doctor of Medicine degree. RUSM has graduated more than 15,000 physicians since inception. The mission of RUSM is to prepare highly dedicated students to become effective and successful physicians. RUSM seeks to accomplish this by focusing on imparting the knowledge, skills, and values required for its students to establish a successful and satisfying career as a physician. In January 2019, RUSM moved its basic science instruction from Dominica to Barbados.
AUC’s and RUSM’s respective medical education programs are comparable to the educational programs offered at U.S. medical schools as evidenced by student performance on the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (“USMLE”) tests and residency placement. AUC’s and RUSM’s programs consist of three academic semesters per year, which begin in January, May, and September, allowing students to begin their basic science instruction at the most convenient time for them.
Initially, AUC and RUSM students complete a program of concentrated study of medical sciences after which they sit for Step 1 of the USMLE, which assesses whether students understand and can apply scientific concepts that are basic to the practice of medicine. Under AUC and RUSM direction, students then complete the remainder of their program by participating in clinical rotations conducted at over 40 affiliated teaching hospitals or medical centers connected with accredited medical education programs in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Towards the end of the clinical training and prior to graduation, AUC and RUSM students take USMLE, Step 2 CK (Clinical Knowledge), which assesses ability to apply medical knowledge, skills, and understanding of clinical science essential for the provision of patient care under supervision and includes emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention. Successfully passing USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills previously was a requirement for graduation and for certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (“ECFMG”) to enter the U.S. residency match. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills has been discontinued. ECFMG has developed alternative pathways to replace this requirement, for which AUC and RUSM are generally eligible. In addition, flexibility to use some online clinical training has been allowed by accreditors and other U.S. regulatory bodies. These alternatives are critical to keeping many students on track to graduate and enter the 2023 residency match.

Upon successful completion of their medical degree requirements, students apply for a residency position in their area of specialty through the National Residency Matching Program (“NRMP”). This process is also known as “The Match”® and utilizes an algorithm to “match” applicants to programs using the certified rank order lists of the applicants and program directors.
AUC students achieved a 93% and 84% first-time pass rate on the USMLE Step 1 exam in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Of first-time eligible AUC graduates, 92% and 96% attained residency positions in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
RUSM students achieved a 91% and 83% first-time pass rate on the USMLE Step 1 exam in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Of first-time eligible RUSM graduates, 92% and 95% attained residency positions in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
In September 2019, AUC opened its medical education program in the U.K. in partnership with University of Central Lancashire (“UCLAN”). The program offers students a Post Graduate Diploma in International Medical Sciences from UCLAN, followed by their Doctor of Medicine degree from AUC. Students are eligible to do clinical rotations at AUC’s clinical sites, which include hospitals in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada. This program is aimed at preparing students for USMLEs. 
MERP is a 15-week medical school preparatory program focused on enhancing the academic foundation of prospective AUC and RUSM students and providing them with the skills they need to be successful in medical school and to achieve their goals of becoming physicians. Upon successful completion of the MERP program, students are guaranteed admission to AUC or RUSM. Data has shown that the performance of students who complete the MERP program is consistent with students who were admitted directly into medical school.
RUSVM
RUSVM, founded in 1982 and acquired by Adtalem in 2003, provides veterinary education and confers the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, as well as Masters of Science and Ph.D. degrees. RUSVM is one of 54 American Veterinary Medical Association (“AVMA”) accredited veterinary education institutions in the world. RUSVM is located in St. Kitts and has graduated nearly 6,000 veterinarians since inception. The mission of RUSVM is to provide the best learning environment to prepare students to become members and leaders of the worldwide public and professional healthcare system and to advance human and animal health through research and knowledge exchange.
The RUSVM program is structured to provide a veterinary education that is comparable to educational programs at U.S. veterinary schools. RUSVM students complete a seven-semester, pre-clinical curriculum at the campus in St. Kitts. After completing their pre-clinical curriculum, RUSVM students enter a clinical clerkship under RUSVM direction lasting approximately 45 weeks at one of 31 clinical affiliates located in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.K.
RUSVM offers a one-semester Veterinary Preparatory Program (“Vet Prep”) designed to enhance the pre-clinical science knowledge and study skills that are critical to success in veterinary school. The Vet Prep advancement rate for 2019-2020 was 87%, which represents the percent of Vet Prep students in 2019-2020 who started at RUSVM within one year.
In 2020 and 2021, instruction for both the RUSVM and Vet Prep programs was partially offered online in response to COVID-19 travel restrictions. All students have returned to full-time instruction in St. Kitts.
Student Admissions and Admissions Standards
AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM employ regional admissions representatives in locations throughout the U.S. and Canada who provide information to students interested in their respective programs. A successful applicant must have completed the required prerequisite courses and, for AUC and RUSM, taken the Medical College Admission Test (“MCAT”), while RUSVM applicants must have completed the Graduate Record Exam (“GRE”). Candidates for admission must interview with an admissions representative and all admission decisions are made by the admissions committees of the medical and veterinary schools. AUC allows several entrance examinations for its international students. The MCAT (and other entrance exams) requirement is currently waived due to lack of availability of testing caused by COVID-19 closures. ED, 

9



which usually mandates that the schools require MCAT for U.S. citizens, has currently waived this requirement. Both AUC’s and RUSM’s admission committees began evaluating students without an MCAT for the September 2020 class and continue to do so. RUSVM waived GRE requirements for classes starting in January 2021 and May 2021 because of limited testing availability due to COVID-19.
Discontinued Operations
In accordance with GAAP, the ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine entities, which were divested during fiscal year 2022 and Adtalem Brazil, which was divested during fiscal year 2020, are classified as “Discontinued Operations.” As a result, all financial results, disclosures, and discussions of continuing operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K exclude these entities operations, unless otherwise noted. In addition, we continue to incur costs associated with ongoing litigation and settlements related to the DeVry University divestiture, which was completed during fiscal year 2019, and are classified as expense within discontinued operations.

Overview of the Impact of COVID-19
On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has had tragic consequences across the globe and altered business and consumer activity across many industries. Management initiated several changes to the operations of our institutions and administrative functions in order to protect the health of our students and employees and to mitigate the financial effects of COVID-19 and its resultant economic slowdown. We will continue to evaluate, and if appropriate, adopt other measures in the future required for the ongoing safety of our students and employees. See also the COVID-19 section in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

10



of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information, including the effects of COVID-19 on our operations.
●Chamberlain: Approximately 30% of Chamberlain’s students are based at campus locations and pursuing their BSN degree; at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, all campus-based students transitioned to online learning for didactic and select clinical experiences. The remaining 70% of Chamberlain’s students are enrolled in online programs that may or may not have clinical components and those programs continued to successfully operate. Students and employees have returned to all Chamberlain campuses for onsite instruction. Management believes that COVID-19 disruptions in the healthcare industry may have driven the enrollment decisions of potential students in the fiscal year 2022 sessions; however, the resulting revenue losses specific to COVID-19 are not quantifiable. COVID-19 did not result in significantly increased costs at Chamberlain in fiscal year 2022 and 2021. The extent of the impact in fiscal year 2023 and beyond will be determined based on the length and severity of the effects of COVID-19, the efficacy and distribution of the vaccines, and whether any pandemic surge affects healthcare facilities’ ability to continue to provide clinical experiences. Chamberlain has clinical partnerships with healthcare facilities across the U.S., minimizing the risk of suspension of all onsite clinical education experiences.

●Walden: All of Walden’s students are enrolled in online programs and these programs have continued to successfully operate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Management believes that COVID-19 disruptions in the healthcare industry may have driven the enrollment decisions of potential students in fiscal year 2022; however, the resulting revenue losses specific to COVID-19 are not quantifiable. COVID-19 did not result in increased costs at Walden in fiscal year 2022. The extent of the impact in fiscal year 2023 and beyond will be determined based on the length and severity of the effects of COVID-19 and the efficacy and distribution of the vaccines.

●AUC and RUSM: Medical students enrolled in the basic science portion of their program transitioned to online learning at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Many students left St. Maarten and Barbados to continue their studies remotely from other locations. AUC and RUSM were able to provide remote learning and have students remain eligible for U.S. federal financial aid assistance under a waiver provided by the U.S. Secretary of Education that was included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) signed into law in March 2020. The waiver was dependent upon the host country’s coronavirus state of emergency declaration. The nation of St. Maarten lifted their declaration in June 2020, and as a result, AUC’s ability to offer distance education ended after the September 2020 semester, requiring all AUC students to return to St. Maarten for basic science instruction effective January 2021. A limited number of RUSM students began returning to Barbados in January and May 2021 with a full return occurring for the September 2021 semester. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the “Appropriations Act”) was signed into law in December 2020, and corrected technical errors in the CARES Act, which clarified the authority to operate via distance learning due to a declaration of an emergency in an applicable country or a qualifying emergency in the U.S. This section also extended these flexibilities through the end of the qualifying emergency or June 30, 2022, whichever was later. The Appropriations Act provided Adtalem’s foreign institutions the ability to continue distance education without disruption to their students’ Title IV federal financial aid. Management believes uncertainties caused by COVID-19 may have driven the enrollment decisions of potential and current students; however, COVID-19 did not result in significant or quantifiable revenue losses or increased costs within the basic science programs at the medical schools in fiscal year 2022 and 2021, except with respect to housing operations in fiscal year 2021, as discussed below. COVID-19 will likely continue to have a minimal impact on basic science program revenue in fiscal year 2023, unless significant numbers of students choose to not continue or start their studies during this time of uncertainty. The extent of the impact in fiscal year 2023 and beyond will be determined based on the length and severity of the effects of COVID-19, the efficacy and distribution of the vaccines, and whether any pandemic surge affects healthcare facilities’ ability to continue to provide clinical experiences. Students who have completed their basic science education progress to clinical rotations in the U.S. and the U.K. Clinical rotations for all students were temporarily suspended in March 2020; however, some students were able to participate in online clinical elective courses during this transition period and beyond. The COVID-19 surge experienced during the winter in fiscal year 2021 across the U.S. caused many partner hospitals to again reduce the hours available for clinical experiences. As a result, although many students were able to resume their clinical education during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, management estimates that not being able to offer a full clinical program reduced combined revenue of AUC and RUSM by approximately $21 million and operating income losses by approximately $14 million in fiscal year 2021. As of June 2021, all clinical partners of AUC and RUSM resumed their clinical programs. As a result, COVID-19 did not result in any lost clinical revenue in fiscal year 2022. Should future surges in COVID-19 again restrict the number 

11



of clinical hours available to our students, we could experience negative effects on revenue and operating income in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Adtalem has clinical partnerships with hospitals across the U.S. and the U.K., minimizing the risk of suspension of all onsite clinical education experiences. In addition to the loss of clinical revenue and operating income at AUC and RUSM, management estimates losses of housing and student transportation revenue of approximately $13 million and operating income of approximately $10 million in fiscal year 2021 due to students not returning to the St. Maarten and Barbados campuses. All students were allowed back on the two campuses in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, and therefore, COVID-19 did not result in significant lost housing and student transportation revenue in fiscal year 2022.
●RUSVM: All basic science veterinary students transitioned to online learning beginning in March 2020. Many students left St. Kitts in March 2020 to continue their studies remotely from other locations. As of May 2021, all basic science students returned to St. Kitts where lectures continue to be delivered both in-person and remotely and with labs delivered in-person. COVID-19 did not result in significant revenue losses or increased costs within the basic science program in fiscal year 2022 and 2021. We do not expect a significant impact from COVID-19 on the basic science program in fiscal year 2023, unless students choose to not continue or start their studies during this time of uncertainty. RUSVM continued to provide remote learning during the pandemic and students remained eligible for U.S. federal financial aid assistance under a waiver provided by the CARES Act and the Appropriations Act. The Appropriations Act extended through the end of the qualifying emergency or June 30, 2022, whichever was later, as described above. Students who have completed their basic science education progress to clinical rotations at select universities in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.K. A few universities initially suspended onsite clinical experiences and transitioned students to online education. All universities have since resumed onsite clinical courses. The initial suspensions did not significantly reduce revenue or operating income in fiscal year 2022 and 2021. While we do not expect a significant impact from COVID-19 at RUSVM, the extent of the impact on clinical experiences in fiscal year 2023 and beyond will be determined based on the length and severity of the effects of COVID-19, the efficacy and distribution of the vaccines, and whether any pandemic surge affects healthcare facilities’ ability to continue to provide clinical experiences.
●Administrative Operations: Remote and hybrid work arrangements continue in both the U.S. and at foreign locations and employees have begun to return to offices. The remote work arrangements have not adversely affected Adtalem’s ability to maintain operations, financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting, or disclosure controls and procedures. The effectiveness of our remote technology enables our ability to maintain these systems and controls. Management does not anticipate Adtalem will be materially impacted by any constraints or other impacts on our human capital resources and productivity. Travel restrictions and border closures are not expected to have a material impact on our ability to operate and achieve operational goals. While recent travel expenditures have been lower than historical levels, we would expect these costs to increase as the effects of COVID-19 continue to dissipate. No significant home office costs related to COVID-19 were incurred in fiscal year 2022 and 2021, and no such costs are anticipated in fiscal year 2023 and beyond.

Market Trends and Competition
Chamberlain
Chamberlain competes in the U.S. nursing education market, which has more than 2,000 programs leading to RN licensure. These include four-year educational institutions, two-year community colleges, and diploma schools of nursing. The market consists of two distinct segments: pre-licensure nursing programs that prepare students to take the NCLEX-RN licensure exam and post-licensure nursing programs that allow existing RNs to advance their education.
In the pre-licensure nursing market, capacity limitations and restricted new student enrollment are common among traditional four-year educational institutions and community colleges. Chamberlain has 23 campuses located in 15 states. In Fall 2021, according to data obtained from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (“AACN”), Chamberlain had the largest pre-licensure program in the U.S.
In post-licensure nursing education, there are more than 700 institutions offering RN-to-BSN programs and more than 600 institutions offering MSN programs. Chamberlain’s RN-to-BSN degree completion option has received three certifications from Quality Matters, an independent global organization leading quality assurance in online teaching and 

12



learning environments. Chamberlain has earned the Online Learning Support, Online Teaching Support, and Online Learner Success certifications. Chamberlain’s RN-to-BSN degree completion option, MSN degree program, and DNP degree program are approved in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The MSN FNP track is approved in 46 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands, while the AGACP and AGPCP tracks are approved in 42 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The MPH program is approved in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The MSW program is approved in 37 states and Puerto Rico.
In Fall 2021, according to AACN data, Chamberlain had the largest FNP and DNP programs in the U.S.
Walden
The market for fully online higher education, in which Walden competes, remains a highly competitive and growing space. As a comprehensive university offering degrees at the bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral level, in addition to certificates and a school of lifelong learning, the competition varies depending on the degree level and the discipline. While Walden’s target market of working professionals 25 years and older was once underserved, it now has a variety of options to meet the growing need for higher education.
 Walden has degree programs in nursing, education, counseling, business, psychology, public health, social work and human services, public administration and public policy, and criminal justice. Walden competes both with other comprehensive universities and also more narrowly focused schools, which may only offer a few degree programs. Given the growing and ever-changing market, Walden competes with a wide variety of higher education institutions as well as other education providers.
 Walden competes with traditional public and private non-profit institutions and for-profit schools. As more campus-based institutions offer online programs, the competition for online higher education has been growing. Typically, public universities charge lower tuitions compared with Walden due to state subsidies, government grants, and access to other financial resources. On the other hand, tuition at private non-profit institutions is higher than the average tuition rates at Walden. Walden competes with other educational institutions principally based on price, quality of education, reputation, learning modality, educational programs, and student services. 
Walden has over 50 years of experience offering high quality distance education with a mission to provide access to higher education for working professionals. Walden remains a leader in many areas and is one of the leading doctoral degree conferrers in nursing, public health, public policy, business/management, education, and psychology and one of the leading conferrers of master’s degrees in nursing, psychology, social work, human services, education, and counseling.
Medical and Veterinary
AUC and RUSM compete with approximately 150 U.S. schools of medicine, 48 U.S. colleges of osteopathic medicine, and more than 40 Caribbean medical schools as well as with international medical schools recruiting U.S. students who may be eligible to receive funding from ED Title IV programs. RUSVM competes with AVMA accredited schools, of which 33 are U.S.-based, 5 are Canadian and 16 are other international veterinary schools.
There has been some recent expansion in the U.S. medical education and veterinary education enrollment capacities because of the growing supply/demand imbalance for medical doctors and veterinarians. Despite this expansion, management believes the imbalance will continue to spur demand for medical and veterinary education.
Accreditation and Other Regulatory Approvals
Educational institutions and their individual programs are awarded accreditation by achieving a level of quality that entitles them to the confidence of the educational community and the public they serve. Accredited institutions are subject to periodic review by accrediting bodies to ensure continued high performance and institutional and program improvement and integrity, and to confirm that accreditation requirements continue to be satisfied. College and university administrators depend on the accredited status of an institution when evaluating transfer credit and applicants to their schools; employers rely on the accreditation status of an institution when evaluating a candidate’s credentials; parents and high school counselors look to accreditation for assurance that an institution meets quality educational standards; and many professions require candidates to graduate from an accredited program in order to obtain professional licensure in their respective 

13



fields. Moreover, in the U.S., accreditation is necessary for students to qualify for federal financial assistance and most scholarship commissions restrict their awards to students attending accredited institutions.
Chamberlain
Chamberlain is institutionally accredited by the HLC, an institutional accreditation agency recognized by ED. In addition to institutional accreditation, Chamberlain has also obtained programmatic accreditation for specific programs. BSN, MSN, DNP, and post-graduate Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (“APRN”) certificate programs are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (“CCNE”). Chamberlain’s MPH program is accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health. Chamberlain’s MSW program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education’s Commission on Accreditation. The Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (“ARC-PA”) has granted Accreditation-Provisional status to the Master of Physician Assistant Studies program. Accreditation-Provisional is an accreditation status granted when the plans and resource allocation, if fully implemented as planned, of a proposed program that has not yet enrolled students appear to demonstrate the program’s ability to meet the ARC-PA Standards or when a program holding Accreditation-Provisional status appears to demonstrate continued progress in complying with the Standards as it prepares for the graduation of the first class (cohort) of students. Accreditation-Provisional does not ensure any subsequent accreditation status. It is limited to no more than five years from matriculation of the first class. Additionally, Chamberlain is an accredited provider of nursing continuing professional development credits by the American Nursing Credentialing Center.

Additionally, Walden is an accredited provider of continuing education credits by the American Nursing Credentialling Center.
Medical and Veterinary
The Government of St. Maarten authorizes AUC to confer the Doctor of Medicine degree. AUC is accredited by the Accreditation Commission on Colleges of Medicine (“ACCM”). The ACCM is an international medical school accrediting organization for countries that do not have a national medical school accreditation body. The U.S. Department of Education National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation (“NCFMEA”) has affirmed that the ACCM has established and enforces standards of educational accreditation that are comparable to those promulgated by the U.S. Liaison Committee on Medical Education (“LCME”). In addition, AUC is authorized to place students in clinical rotations in the majority of U.S. states, including California, Florida, and New York, where robust processes are in place to evaluate and approve an international medical school’s programs. AUC students can join residency training programs in all 50 states. AUC has also been deemed acceptable by the Graduate Medical Council (“GMC”), the accrediting body in the U.K., which allows AUC graduates to apply for post-graduate (residency) programs in the U.K.

14



RUSM’s primary accreditor is Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions (“CAAM-HP”). CAAM-HP is authorized to accredit medical programs by the government of Barbados. On July 26, 2018, Barbados authorized RUSM to confer the Doctor of Medicine degree. The NCFMEA has affirmed that CAAM-HP has established and enforces standards of educational accreditation that are comparable to those promulgated by the LCME. In addition, RUSM is authorized to place students in clinical rotations in the majority of U.S. states, including California, Florida, New Jersey, and New York, where robust processes are in place to evaluate and accredit an international medical school’s programs. RUSM students can join residency training programs in all 50 states.
RUSVM has been recognized by the government of the Federation of St. Christopher and Nevis (“St. Kitts”) and is chartered to confer the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree. The Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree is accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education (“AVMA COE”). RUSVM has affiliations with 31 AVMA-accredited U.S. and international colleges of veterinary medicine so that RUSVM students can complete their final three clinical semesters of study in the U.S. or abroad. RUSVM has received accreditation for its Postgraduate Studies program from the St. Christopher & Nevis Accreditation Board. The Postgraduate Studies program offers Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees in all research areas supported by RUSVM. Areas of emphasis are guided by RUSVM's themed research centers.
Regulatory Environment
Student Payments
Adtalem’s primary source of liquidity is the cash received from payments for student tuition, books, other educational materials, and fees. These payments include funds originating as financial aid from various federal and state loan and grant programs, student and family educational loans (“private loans”), employer educational reimbursements, scholarships, and student and family financial resources. Adtalem continues to provide financing options for its students, including Adtalem’s credit extension programs.
The following table, which excludes ACAMS, Adtalem Brazil, Becker, EduPristine, and OCL revenue, summarizes Adtalem’s revenue by fund source as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Final data for fiscal year 2022 is not yet available.

Financial Aid
All financial aid and assistance programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations. In the U.S., the Higher Education Act (as reauthorized, the “HEA”) guides the federal government’s support of postsecondary education. The HEA was last reauthorized by the U.S. Congress in July 2008 and was signed into law in August 2008. In the 117th Congress, a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill has not been introduced. However, standalone bills impacting Title IV federal financial aid programs have been introduced in both chambers of Congress. Some of these bills could be included in a larger legislative package, which could include the HEA. When the HEA is reauthorized, existing programs and participation requirements are subject to change. Additionally, funding for student financial assistance programs may be impacted during appropriations and budget actions.
Information about Particular U.S. and Canadian Government Financial Aid Programs
Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM students participate in many U.S. and Canadian financial aid programs. Each of these programs is briefly described below.

15



U.S. Federal Financial Aid Programs
Students in the U.S. rely on three types of ED student financial aid programs under Title IV of the HEA.
1. Grants. Chamberlain and Walden undergraduate students may participate in the Federal Pell Grant and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant programs.

● | Federal Pell Grants: These funds do not have to be repaid and are available to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need and who have not already received a baccalaureate degree. For the 2021-2022 school year, eligible students could receive Federal Pell Grants ranging from $650 to $6,495.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (“FSEOG”): This is a supplement to the Federal Pell Grant and is only available to the neediest undergraduate students. Federal rules restrict the amount of FSEOG funds that may go to a single institution. The maximum individual FSEOG award is established by the institution but cannot exceed $4,000 per academic year. Educational institutions are required to supplement federal funds with a 25% matching contribution. Institutional matching contributions may be satisfied, in whole or in part, by state grants, scholarship funds (discussed below), or by externally provided scholarship grants.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Loans. Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM students may participate in the Direct Unsubsidized and PLUS programs within the Federal Direct Student Loan Program. Chamberlain and Walden undergraduate students may also be eligible for Subsidized Loans within the Federal Direct Student Loan Program.

● | Direct Subsidized Loan: Awarded on the basis of student financial need, it is a low-interest loan (a portion of the interest is subsidized by the Federal government) available to undergraduate students with interest charges and principal repayment deferred until six months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis (the student is responsible for paying the interest charges during the six months after no longer attending school on at least a half-time basis for those loans with a first disbursement between July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2014). Loan limits per academic year range from $3,500 for students in their first academic year, $4,500 for their second academic year, to $5,500 for students in their third or higher undergraduate academic year.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Awarded to students who do not meet the needs test or as an additional supplement to the Direct Subsidized Loan. These loans incur interest from the time funds are disbursed, but actual principal and interest payments may be deferred until six months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits vary based on dependency status and level of study, with $2,000 for undergraduate dependent students per academic year. Independent undergraduate students may borrow $6,000 in their first and second academic years, increasing to $7,000 in later undergraduate years. Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits then increase to $20,500 per academic year for graduate and professional program students. Additionally, a student without financial need may borrow an additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount up to the limit of the Direct Subsidized Loan at their respective academic grade level. The total Direct Subsidized and/or Direct Unsubsidized Loan aggregate borrowing limit for undergraduate students is $57,500 and $138,500 for graduate students, which is inclusive of Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts borrowed as an undergraduate.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct Grad PLUS and Direct Parent PLUS Loans: Enables a graduate student or parents of a dependent undergraduate student to borrow additional funds to meet the cost of the student’s education. These loans are not based on financial need, nor are they subsidized. These loans incur interest from the time funds are disbursed, but actual principal and interest payments may be deferred until a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. Graduate students and parents may borrow funds up to the cost of attendance, which includes allowances for tuition, fees, and living expenses. Both Direct Grad PLUS and Direct Parent PLUS Loans are subject to credit approval, which generally requires the borrower to be free of any current adverse credit conditions. A co-borrower may be used to meet the credit requirements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Federal Work-study. Chamberlain participates in this program, which offers work opportunities, both on or off campus, on a part-time basis to students who demonstrate financial need. Federal Work-study wages are paid partly from federal funds and partly from qualified employer funds.

16



State Financial Aid Programs
Certain states, including Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Vermont, offer state grant or loan assistance to eligible undergraduate students attending Adtalem institutions.
Canadian Government Financial Aid Programs
Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada (other than students from the Northwest Territories, Nunavet, or Quebec) are eligible for loans under the Canada Student Loans Program, which is financed by the Canadian government. Eligibility and amount of funding vary by province. Canadian students attending Walden or Chamberlain online while in the U.S., or attending AUC, RUSM, or RUSVM, may be eligible for the Canada Student Loan Program. The loans are interest-free while the student is in school, and repayment begins six months after the student leaves school. Qualified students also may benefit from Canada Study Grants (designed for students whose financial needs and special circumstances cannot otherwise be met), tax-free withdrawals from retirement savings plans, tax-free education savings plans, loan repayment extensions, and interest relief on loans.
Information about Other Financial Aid Programs
Private Loan Programs
Some Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM students rely on private (non-federal) loan programs borrowed from private lenders for financial assistance. These programs are used to finance the gap between a student’s cost of attendance and their financial aid awards. The amount of the typical loan varies significantly according to the student’s enrollment and unmet need.
Most private loans are approved on the basis of the student’s and/or a co-borrower’s credit history. The cost of these loans varies, but in almost all cases will be more expensive than the federal programs. The application process is separate from the federal financial aid process. Student finance personnel at Adtalem’s degree-granting institutions coordinate these processes so that students receive assistance from the federal and state programs before utilizing private loans.
With the exception of Chamberlain, Adtalem’s institutions do not maintain preferred lender lists. However, all students are entirely free to utilize a lender of their choice.
Tax-Favored Programs
The U.S. has a number of tax-favored programs aimed at promoting savings for future college expenses. These include state-sponsored “529” college savings plans, state-sponsored prepaid tuition plans, education savings accounts (formerly known as education IRAs), custodial accounts for minors, Hope and Lifetime Learning tax credits, and tax deductions for interest on student loans.
Adtalem-Provided Financial Assistance
Each of our institutions offers a variety of scholarships to assist with tuition and fee expenses, some of which are one-time awards while others are renewable. Some students may also qualify for more than one scholarship at a time.
Chamberlain students are eligible for numerous institutional scholarships with awards up to $2,500 per semester. 
Eligible Walden students may receive an institutional grant valued up to $750 per term. Walden offers a number of different scholarships discounts and other tuition assistance. These vary by program and by term but usually consist of any of the following: $500-$1,000 grants per term over three to ten terms; scholarships specific to the company they work for; if they are an alumnus of Walden; or if they are in the military.
Students at AUC may be eligible for an institutional scholarship, ranging from $5,000 to $80,000 to cover expenses incurred from tuition and fees. Students at RUSM may be eligible for various institutional scholarships, ranging from $5,000 to $108,000, to cover expenses incurred from housing, tuition and fees. Students at RUSVM may be eligible for an institutional scholarship, ranging from $2,000 to $27,123 to cover expenses incurred from tuition and fees.

17



Adtalem’s credit extension programs are available to students at Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM. These credit extension programs are designed to assist students who are unable to completely cover educational costs consisting of tuition, books, and fees, and are available only after all other student financial assistance has been applied toward those purposes. In addition, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM allow students to finance their living expenses. Repayment plans for financing agreements are developed to address the financial circumstances of the particular student. Interest charges at rates from 3.0% to 12.0% per annum accrue each month on the unpaid balance once a student withdraws or graduates from a program. Most students are required to begin repaying their loans while they are still in school with a minimum payment level designed to demonstrate their capability to repay, which reduces the possibility of over borrowing. Payments may increase upon completing or departing school. After a student leaves school, the student typically will have a monthly installment repayment plan.
The finance agreements do not impose any origination fees, in general have a fixed rate of interest, and most carry annual and aggregate maximums that ensure that they are only a supplemental source of funding and not relied on as the main source. Borrowers must be current in their payments in order to be eligible for subsequent disbursements. Borrowers are advised about the terms of the financing agreements and counseled to utilize all other available private and federal funding options before securing financing through the institution.
Adtalem financing agreements are carried on our balance sheet, net of related reserves, and there are no relationships with external parties that reduce Adtalem’s risk of collections.
Employer-Provided Tuition Assistance
Chamberlain and Walden students who receive employer tuition assistance may choose from several deferred tuition payment plans. Students eligible for tuition reimbursement plans may have their tuition billed directly to their employers or payment may be deferred until after the end of the session.
Walden students eligible for tuition reimbursement must make payment arrangements with Walden and then be reimbursed by their employer. When the employer pays on behalf of the employee, Walden will bill the employer and payment terms are due 20 days from the receipt of the billing statement.
Legislative and Regulatory Requirements
Government-funded financial assistance programs are governed by extensive and complex regulations in the U.S. Like any other educational institution, Adtalem’s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies and is subject to audit or investigation by other governmental authorities. Any violation could be the basis for penalties or other disciplinary action, including initiation of a suspension, limitation, or termination proceeding.
U.S. Federal Regulations
Our domestic postsecondary institutions are subject to extensive federal and state regulations. The HEA and the related ED regulations govern all higher education institutions participating in Title IV programs and provide for a regulatory triad by mandating specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following: (1) the federal government through ED, (2) the accrediting agencies recognized by ED, and (3) state higher education regulatory bodies.
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, a postsecondary institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by ED, must comply with the HEA and all applicable regulations thereunder, and must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state in which the institution operates, as applicable.
In addition to governance by the regulatory triad, there has been increased focus by members of the U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including ED, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), on the role that proprietary educational institutions play in higher education. We expect that this challenging regulatory environment will continue for the foreseeable future.
Changes in or new interpretations of applicable laws, rules, or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, and operating costs. The failure to maintain or renew any required regulatory approvals, accreditation, or state 

18



authorizations could have a material adverse effect on us. ED regulations regarding financial responsibility provide that, if any one of our Title IV participating institutions (“Title IV Institutions”) is unable to pay its obligations under its program participation agreement (“PPA”) as a result of operational issues and/or an enforcement action, our other Title IV Institutions, regardless of their compliance with applicable laws and regulations, would not be able to maintain their Title IV eligibility without assisting in the repayment of the non-compliant institution’s Title IV obligations. As a result, even though Adtalem’s Title IV Institutions are operated through independent entities, an enforcement action against one of our institutions could also have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Adtalem’s other Title IV Institutions and Adtalem as a whole and could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on the ability of Adtalem’s other Title IV Institutions and Adtalem as a whole to operate. For further information, see “A bankruptcy filing by us or by any of our Title IV Institutions, or a closure of one of our Title IV Institutions, would lead to an immediate loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs” under subsection “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Highly Regulated Industry” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
We have summarized the most significant current regulatory requirements applicable to our domestic postsecondary operations. Adtalem has been impacted by these regulations and enforcement efforts and is currently facing multiple related lawsuits arising from the enhanced scrutiny facing the proprietary education sector. For information regarding such pending investigations and litigation, and the potential impact such matters could have on our institutions or on Adtalem, see in this Annual Report on Form 10-K: (1) Note 20 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” (2) the subsection of Item 1A. “Risk Factors” titled “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Highly Regulated Industry,” and (3) the subsection of Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” titled “Regulatory Environment.”
Eligibility and Certification Procedures
The HEA specifies the manner in which ED reviews institutions for eligibility and certification to participate in Title IV programs. Every educational institution participating in the Title IV programs must be certified to participate and is required to periodically renew this certification. Institutions that violate certain ED Title IV regulations, including its financial responsibility and administrative capability regulations, may lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or may only continue participation under provisional certification. Institutions that do not meet financial responsibility requirements are typically required to be subject to heightened cash monitoring requirements and post a letter of credit (equal to a minimum of 10% of the Title IV aid it received in the institution’s most recent fiscal year). Provisional certification status also carries fewer due process protections than full certification. As a result, ED may withdraw an institution’s provisional certification more easily than if it is fully certified. Provisional certification does not otherwise limit access to Title IV program funds by students attending the institution. ED has initiated rulemaking proceedings to amend the certification procedures. The earliest we believe any new rules will be effective is July 1, 2024.
Defense to Repayment Regulations
Under the HEA, ED is authorized to specify in regulations, which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a Defense to Repayment of a Direct Loan made under the Federal Direct Loan Program. On July 1, 2020, new Defense to Repayment regulations went into effect that include a higher threshold for establishing misrepresentation, provides for a statute of limitation for claims submission, narrows the current triggers allowed for letter of credit requirements, and eliminates provisions for group discharges. The new regulations are effective with claims on loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2020. ED has initiated rulemaking proceedings to amend the Defense to Repayment regulations. The earliest any new rules will be effective is July 1, 2023.
The “90/10 Rule”
An ED regulation known as the “90/10 Rule” affects only proprietary postsecondary institutions, such as Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM. Under this regulation, an institution that derives more than 90% of its revenue on a cash basis from Title IV student financial assistance programs in two consecutive fiscal years loses eligibility to participate in these programs for at least two fiscal years. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “Rescue Act”) enacted on March 11, 2021 amended the 90/10 rule to require that a proprietary institution derive no more than 90% of its revenue from federal education assistance funds, including but not limited to previously excluded U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and military tuition assistance benefits. This change was subject to negotiated rulemaking, which ended in March 

19



2022. The amended rule will first apply to institutional fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The following table details the percentage of revenue on a cash basis from federal financial assistance programs as calculated under current regulations (excluding the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and military tuition assistance benefits) for each of Adtalem’s Title IV-eligible institutions for fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Final data for fiscal year 2022 is not yet available.


​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
--------------------------------------------------------+---+-------------+---+------+--
​ | ​ | Fiscal Year | 
​ | ​ | 2021 | ​ | 2020 | 
Chamberlain University | | 66 | % | 62 | %
American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine | | 80 | % | 81 | %
Ross University School of Medicine | | 85 | % | 85 | %
Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine | | 82 | % | 84 | %

Fiscal year data for Walden is not available as they previously reported on a calendar year basis. As reported by Laureate Education, Inc. in their February 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Walden derived approximately 76% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV program funds for the year ended December 31, 2020.
In September 2016, Adtalem committed to voluntarily limit to 85% the amount of revenue that each of its Title IV-eligible institutions derive from federal funding, including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and military tuition assistance benefits. As disclosed in the third-party review reports that have been made publicly available, Adtalem’s institutions that were owned at each reporting date have met this lower threshold for each fiscal year since the commitment was made. Adtalem is committed to implementing measures to promote responsible recruitment and enrollment, successful student outcomes, and informed student choice. Management believes students deserve greater transparency to make informed choices about their education. This commitment builds upon a solid foundation and brings Adtalem to a new self-imposed level of public accountability and transparency.
Incentive Compensation
An educational institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus, or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or awarding of Title IV program funds, if such payments are based directly or indirectly in any part on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. The law and regulations governing this requirement have not established clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances, but, prior to 2011, there were 12 safe harbors that defined specific types of compensation that were deemed to constitute permissible incentive compensation. New rules effective in 2011 eliminated the 12 safe harbors. These changes increased the uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation. This makes the development of effective and compliant performance metrics more difficult to establish. As such, these changes have limited and are expected to continue to limit Adtalem’s ability to compensate our employees based on their performance of their job responsibilities, which could make it more difficult to attract and retain highly-qualified employees. Management believes that Adtalem has not been, nor is currently, involved in any activities that violate the restrictions on commissions, bonuses, or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment, admissions, or awarding of Title IV program funds.
Standards of Financial Responsibility
A financial responsibility test is required for continued participation by an institution’s students in U.S. federal financial assistance programs. For Adtalem’s participating institutions, this test is calculated at the consolidated Adtalem level. The test is based upon a composite score of three ratios: an equity ratio that measures the institution’s capital resources; a primary reserve ratio that measures an institution’s ability to fund its operations from current resources; and a net income ratio that measures an institution’s ability to operate profitably. A minimum score of 1.5 is necessary to meet ED’s financial standards. Institutions with scores of less than 1.5 but greater than or equal to 1.0 are considered financially responsible, but require additional oversight. These institutions are subject to heightened cash monitoring and other participation requirements. An institution with a score of less than 1.0 is considered not financially responsible. However, an institution with a score of less than 1.0 may continue to participate in the Title IV programs under provisional certification. In addition, this lower score typically requires that the institution be subject to heightened cash monitoring requirements and post a letter of credit (equal to a minimum of 10% of the Title IV aid it received in the institution's most recent fiscal year).

20



For the past several years, Adtalem’s composite score has exceeded the required minimum of 1.5. Changes to the manner in which the composite score is calculated that were effective on July 1, 2020 has negatively affected Adtalem’s composite score for fiscal year 2022 and will continue to negatively affect future Adtalem scores. At this time, management does not believe these changes by themselves will result in the score falling below 1.5. However, as a result of the acquisition of Walden and the related transactions, Adtalem expects its consolidated composite score to fall below 1.5 for its fiscal year 2022 financial responsibility test. If Adtalem becomes unable to meet requisite financial responsibility standards within the regulations, management believes it will be able to otherwise demonstrate its ability to continue to provide educational services; however, our institutions will be required to request additional state regulatory approvals, heightened cash monitoring, and/or be required to post a letter of credit to continue to participate in federal and state financial assistance programs.
ED has initiated rulemaking proceedings to amend the financial responsibility regulations. The earliest we believe any new rules will be effective is July 1, 2024.
Administrative Capability
The HEA directs ED to assess the administrative capability of each institution to participate in Title IV programs. The failure of an institution to satisfy any of the criteria used to assess administrative capability may cause ED to determine that the institution lacks administrative capability and, therefore, subject the institution to additional scrutiny or deny its eligibility for Title IV programs. ED has initiated rulemaking proceedings to amend the administrative capability regulations. The earliest we believe any new rules will be effective is July 1, 2024.
State Authorization
Institutions that participate in Title IV programs must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state where the institution has a physical presence. Chamberlain is specifically authorized to operate in all of the domestic jurisdictions that require such authorizations. Some states assert authority to regulate all degree-granting institutions if their educational programs are available to their residents, whether or not the institutions maintain a physical presence within those states. Chamberlain has obtained licensure in states which require such licensure and where their students are enrolled and is an institutional participant in the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (“NC-SARA”) initiative. Walden does not participate in NC-SARA, and therefore maintains licenses or exemptions in those states that require it to do so to enroll students in distance education programs where they are currently offered.
On December 19, 2016, ED published new rules concerning requirements for institutional eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. These regulations, which would have become effective beginning July 1, 2018, but were delayed until July 1, 2020, were subsequently renegotiated as part of the 2018-2019 Accreditation and Innovation rule-making sessions. The renegotiated rule went into effect on July 1, 2020 and requires an institution offering distance education or correspondence courses to be authorized by each state from which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state. If an institution offers postsecondary education through distance education or correspondence courses in a state that participates in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, and the institution offering the program is located in a state where it is also covered by such an agreement, the institution would be considered legally authorized to offer postsecondary distance or correspondence education in the state where courses are offered via distance education, subject to any limitations in that agreement. The regulations also require an institution to document the state processes for resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education or correspondence courses. Lastly, the regulations require that an institution provide certain disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding its programs that lead to professional licensure. ED has initiated rulemaking proceedings and may amend the rules to require that a program meet state licensure requirements in lieu of the aforementioned disclosures. The earliest we believe any new rules will be effective is July 1, 2024.
Cohort Default Rates
ED has instituted strict regulations that penalize institutions whose students have high default rates on federal student loans. Depending on the type of loan, a loan is considered in default after the borrower becomes at least 270 or 360 days past due. For a variety of reasons, higher default rates are often found in private-sector institutions and community colleges, 

21



many of which tend to have a higher percentage of low-income students enrolled compared to four-year publicly supported and independent colleges and universities.
Educational institutions are penalized to varying degrees under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, depending on the default rate for the “cohort” defined in the statute. An institution with a cohort default rate that exceeds 20% for the year is required to develop a plan to reduce defaults, but the institution’s operations and its students’ ability to utilize student loans are not restricted. An institution with a cohort default rate of 30% or more for three consecutive years is ineligible to participate in these loan programs and cannot offer student loans administered by ED for the fiscal year in which the ineligibility determination is made and for the next two fiscal years. Students attending an institution whose cohort default rate has exceeded 30% for three consecutive years are also ineligible for Federal Pell Grants. Any institution with a cohort default rate of 40% or more in any year is subject to immediate limitation, suspension, or termination proceedings from all federal aid programs.
According to ED, the three-year cohort default rate for all colleges and universities eligible for federal financial aid was 7.3% for the fiscal year 2018 cohort (the latest available) and 9.7% for the fiscal year 2017 cohort.
Default rates for Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM students are as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
--------------------------------------------------------+---+---------------------+---+------+--
​ | ​ | Cohort Default Rate | 
​ | ​ | 2018 | ​ | 2017 | 
Chamberlain University | ​ | 2.6 | % | 3.4 | %
Walden University | ​ | 4.7 | % | 6.8 | %
American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine | ​ | 0.7 | % | 1.4 | %
Ross University School of Medicine | ​ | 0.9 | % | 1.3 | %
Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine | ​ | 0.4 | % | 0.9 | %

Satisfactory Academic Progress
In addition to the requirements that educational institutions must meet, student recipients of financial aid must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their program of study and an appropriate grade point average.
Change of Ownership or Control
Any material change of ownership or change of control of Adtalem, depending on the type of change, may have significant regulatory consequences for each of our Title IV Institutions. Such a change of ownership or control could require recertification by ED, the reevaluation of accreditation by each institution’s accreditors and/or reauthorization by each institutions’ state licensing agencies. If Adtalem experiences a material change of ownership or change of control, then our Title IV Institutions may cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until recertified by ED. There is no assurance that such recertification would be obtained on a timely basis. After a material change in ownership or change of control, most institutions will participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis for a period of one to three years.
In addition, each Title IV Institution is required to report any material change in stock ownership to its principal institutional accrediting body and would generally be required to obtain approval prior to undergoing any transaction that affects, or may affect, its corporate control or governance. In the event of any such change, each of our institution’s accreditors may undertake an evaluation of the effect of the change on the continuing operations of our institution for purposes of determining if continued accreditation is appropriate, which evaluation may include a comprehensive review.
In addition, some states in which our Title IV Institutions are licensed require approval (in some cases, advance approval) of changes in ownership or control in order to remain authorized to operate in those states, and participation in grant programs in some states may be interrupted or otherwise affected by a change in ownership or control.
Refer to the risk factor titled “If regulators do not approve, or delay their approval, of transactions involving a material change of ownership or change of control of Adtalem, the eligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, our institutions’ accreditation and our institutions’ state licenses may be impaired in a manner that materially and adversely affects our business” under subsection “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Highly Regulated Industry” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

22



ED has initiated rulemaking proceedings to amend the changes of ownership regulations. The earliest any new rules will be effective is July 1, 2023.
Gainful Employment
Current law states that proprietary institutions and non-degree programs at private non-profit and public institutions must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. ED has begun the process to define and implement this existing law through what is referred to as the Gainful Employment (“GE”) rules. A prior version of this rule was rescinded on July 1, 2019. We anticipate ED will use debt-to-earnings ratios and earnings thresholds in determining whether graduates were gainfully employed. Repeated failure of a program to meet these measures may result in the program losing Title IV eligibility.
Negotiated rulemaking took place from January 2022 to March 2022. We anticipate the proposed rules will be published in April 2023, resulting in an effective date of July 1, 2024.
State Approvals and Licensing
Adtalem institutions require authorizations from many state higher education authorities to recruit students, operate schools, and grant degrees. Generally, the addition of any new program of study or new operating location also requires approval by the appropriate licensing and regulatory agencies. In the U.S., each Chamberlain location is approved to grant degrees by the respective state in which it is located. Additionally, many states require approval for out-of-state institutions to recruit within their state or offer instruction through online modalities to residents of their states. Adtalem believes its institutions are in compliance with all state requirements as an out-of-state institution. AUC and RUSM clinical programs are accredited as part of their programs of medical education by their respective accrediting bodies, approved by the appropriate boards in those states that have a formal process to do so, and are reported to ED as required.
Many states require private-sector postsecondary education institutions to post surety bonds for licensure. In the U.S., Adtalem has posted approximately $27.9 million of surety bonds with regulatory authorities on behalf of Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM.
Certain states have set standards of financial responsibility that differ from those prescribed by federal regulation. Adtalem believes its institutions are in compliance with state and Canadian provincial regulations. If Adtalem were unable to meet the tests of financial responsibility for a specific jurisdiction, and could not otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility, Adtalem could be required to cease operations in that state. To date, Adtalem has successfully demonstrated its financial responsibility where required.
Seasonality
The seasonal pattern of Adtalem’s enrollments and its educational programs’ starting dates affect the timing of cash flows with higher cash inflows at the beginning of academic sessions.
Human Capital
As of June 30, 2022, Adtalem had the following number of employees:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
-----------------------+---+-----------+---+-------------+---+------
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | Temporary | ​ | ​

Adtalem also utilizes approximately 5,300 independent contractors who teach as adjunct faculty and instructors. These independent contractors are not included in the above table. Our management believes that Adtalem has good relations with its employees.
We continue to regularly gather feedback from our employees through our Engagement Survey to gain insight into how our employees perceive their work environment. The Engagement Survey includes 18 dimensions comprised of 55 questions.
Two of the key dimensions are Engagement and Enablement. Engagement is the “want to” of work, or more specifically, whether employees are committed to the organization and if they are willing to put in extra effort for the good of the organization. Enablement is the “can do” of work, meaning employee skills and abilities are fully utilized in their roles and whether the organizational environment supports them in getting their work done. We partner with Korn Ferry for high performing organization and global industry norm benchmark data (the “Korn Ferry Global Industry Benchmarks”).
For the upcoming survey, we will include questions around the overall health and well-being of our employees and our support in that area. Regarding key dimensions in the survey (Engagement, Enablement, Collaboration, and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) Adtalem consistently aligns with or outpaces our competitors in ratings. Selected results from our Summer 2022 Engagement Survey including the Korn Ferry Global Industry Benchmarks are as follows:

Collaboration during the pandemic remained strong as teams adapted to the new remote work environment. The engagement survey dimension of collaboration was 8% higher than the global industry benchmark. We remain productive and supportive to our students, employer partners and, most importantly, each other. We have moved to a hybrid work environment allowing flexibility to our employees in work location and brought together senior directors and above in certain locations to the office two days a week. We believe this return will further encourage team building and collaboration across departments.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) continue to be core tenets of our culture at Adtalem. Not only do we focus on ensuring a diverse workforce through our Talent First agenda, but our leadership team also participates in initiatives that further the advancement of historically under-represented groups in society. DEI was 12% higher than the global industry benchmark. We continuously measure representation amongst our employee population. Adtalem was named one of America’s Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes in 2022 for the second year in a row.
As of June 30, 2022, our employee diversity was as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

Adtalem offers a comprehensive benefits package including wellness programs for eligible employees. The wellness strategy entitled Live Well takes a wholistic approach to wellbeing through four pillars: Physical, Social, Financial and Emotional. Our health benefits remain competitive with generous paid time off, retirement plan, domestic partner benefits, 

24



adoption assistance, paid parent leave for both mothers and fathers, among others. We recently launched enhancements to our Employee Assistance Program and our mental health and wellbeing application, entitled Ginger. We track participation in our retirement plans and the Ginger application as noted below:

Finally, Adtalem launched additional opportunities for employees to pursue their educational goals through our Education Assistance program. This program offers both tuition discounts and tuition reimbursement at multiple nationally and regionally accredited higher education institutions. We will continue to offer resources to maintain an engaged, healthy, motivated workforce focused on meeting business goals.
The favorability on the newly added question on health and well-being programs was 15% higher than the global industry benchmark from our Summer 2022 Engagement Survey:
