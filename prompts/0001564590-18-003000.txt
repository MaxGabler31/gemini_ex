 Technologies 
 Gentherm’s expertise in thermal management is focused on two general areas: managing the thermal conditions of people and objects and managing the thermal energy conversion to electrical energy.  
Thermoelectric Technologies
 Many of our thermal products manage the thermal conditions of people and objects using our internally developed advanced TED technology. A TED is a solid state circuit that has the capability to produce both hot and cold thermal conditions by use of the 
 5

Peltier effect. The advantages of advanced TEDs over conventional compressed gas systems are that they are environmentally friendly and less complex as they have no moving parts and are compact and light weight.  For the last 17 years, our work on this technology has yielded great improvements in areas of efficiency, durability and performance. 
 Thermoelectric generator (“TEG”) technologies have the reciprocal capability to the Peltier effect, known as the Seebeck effect, whereby thermal energy is converted into electrical power.  Our current research and development activities are concentrated on improving the efficiency of this process, by improving design and adapting new materials that are better suited for TEG commercialization.  These efforts, together with previously sponsored research which focused on the recovery of waste heat from vehicle exhaust and other sources, has led us to introduce this technology to certain specialty markets.    
Resistive Heaters
 Resistive heater technologies are comprised of wire, carbon fiber or positive thermal coefficient (“PTC”) heating elements which quickly and effectively deliver heat to people and objects.  Wire heating elements are designed from stainless steel, copper, our proprietary carbon fiber woven lattice technology called Carbotex® or printed circuit PTC heaters based on the specifications for a particular product application.
Electronics
 Gentherm manufactures and supplies electronics to our core thermal seat comfort, interior comfort and thermal convenience products.  We also supply electronics for products outside this core set and have a contract to supply value-added electronic products to third parties for adjacent areas within the automotive interior, which is scheduled to launch in 2019.  In November 2017, we acquired Canadian-based Etratech Enterprises to expand our electronics capabilities in automotive, consumer and commercial products.
Automotive Cable Systems 
 Gentherm produces automotive cable systems used to connect automotive components to sources of power. The automotive cable systems are an important element in the production of virtually all of our products and form a significant component in how we generate value to our customers by being an efficient, low-cost and high quality manufacturer. We offer cable systems as integrated parts of our products and also as stand-alone components for other automotive applications, such as oxygen sensors.  Our cable systems business includes both ready-made individual cables and ready-to-install cable networks. Sales of products that utilize our automotive cable systems technology represent 9%, 9% and 10% of our total product revenues for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Air Moving Devices
 Our highly durable and quiet air moving devices, including our proprietary blower and fan designs, are essential to all of our products that require air movement.  Production of integrated air moving devices is an example of our expanding manufacturing capabilities and is an important step toward our goal of becoming a full service provider of sub-systems.
Refrigeration Systems
 Refrigeration systems are used in environmental test chambers to cool various products. In most cases the products are heated to a higher temperature (85°C and up) and then cooled down. The heat up and cool down rates are important to thoroughly test the product. Generally products are cooled to -40°C or below. To accomplish this, specialized refrigeration systems are required. Single stage refrigeration systems can cool chambers to -34°C. Two-stage refrigeration systems can achieve -50°C . Cascade refrigeration systems can cool down to -85°C. The customers’ applications determine the temperature range needed. 
Other Technologies
 We are developing new technologies that will help enable improvements to existing products and create new product applications.

Products 
 Seat Comfort
 Climate Control Seat®
 Our CCS products utilize exclusive patented technology to regulate temperature and enhance the comfort of vehicle passengers. The most advanced CCS models use one or more TEDs to generate heating or cooling depending upon the direction of the current applied to the device.
 A TED is the heart of a compact heat pump used in our active CCS products. Air is forced through the heat pump and thermally conditioned in response to electronic switch input from the seat occupant. The conditioned air circulates by one of our specially designed air moving devices through a proprietary air distribution system installed in the seat cushion and seat back, so that the seat surface can be heated or cooled. Each seat has individual electronic controls to adjust the level of heating or cooling. Active CCS products substantially improve comfort compared with conventional air conditioners by focusing cooling directly on the passenger through the seat rather than waiting until ambient air cools the seat surface beneath the passenger.  A heated and ventilated variant of the CCS utilizes ambient cabin air to provide cooling comfort instead of a TED to actively cool the seat. In the heating mode, the vent-only system is supplemented with resistive heating elements.   
 Heated and ventilated CCS products, which are targeted for lower cost vehicle models, provide a lower level of cooling capability than our active CCS solution, but at a lower price. By offering different models of the CCS product, our customers have the opportunity to purchase a wider range of climate control products at different price points. Sales of CCS products contributed 39%, 45% and 47% to our total product revenues for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Heated Seat 
 Heated seats, based on our resistive heater core technology, are seamlessly integrated into automotive seat designs, and are constructed using materials that offer the best capacity, installation characteristics and durability.  Our capabilities allow customers to choose among a variety of resistive heater materials based on their individual vehicle specifications. Sales of heated seat products contributed 31%, 32% and 32% to our total product revenues for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Thermal Convenience
TrueThermTM Cup Holder 
 The TrueTherm cup holder applies Gentherm’s patented TED technologies to keep beverages of automobile drivers and passengers either warm or cool.  We have developed a range of cup holder models with varying degrees of functionality, designed to be packaged in multiple configurations to accommodate different console environments.  Our dual independent design provides separate temperature settings in each holder allowing the driver and passenger to individually maintain a heated or cooled beverage.  
 TrueThermTM Storage Unit
 Gentherm’s TrueTherm storage units provide for food or beverage cooling for the global automotive market.  Using patented TED or refrigeration technologies, the TrueTherm cool storage unit provides temperature control independently from a vehicle’s heating and air conditioning system.  It can be custom designed to accommodate tight interior spaces, such as the front floor console of a sport utility vehicle (SUV), and provide additional cooling capacity to those who have long work commutes or transport multiple passengers.  
Interior Comfort
 Heated Steering Wheel
 Heated steering wheels deliver heating comfort to automobile drivers through resistive wire elements, similar to those used in our seat heater products.  This product can be applied to both leather and wood steering wheels.  A solution for drivers in cold and mild weather climates, the heated steering wheel is designed for the global automotive market.

Heated Door and Armrest 
 Gentherm’s thermally conductive door panel armrest and center console armrest are powered by technologies used in our advanced seat heating products. The system is thermally managed by a heating control system which can be discretely located in the door panel or seat of the vehicle.  Heated door panels and armrests complement our climate controlled seat and steering wheel products and provide a superior level of thermal comfort to the driving experience.  
Battery Thermal Management (“BTM”)
 Thermal management is critically important for the long-term operation of advanced automotive batteries.  The expansion of electrified vehicle applications, such as 48-volt electrical networks, start-stop systems, regenerative braking systems and other micro-hybrid battery implementations, have drastically increased the demand for BTM systems solutions which enable wider operating temperature ranges, enhanced driving range and prolonged life of the battery.  Gentherm’s BTM system can provide precision battery cooling on pack or cell-level using patented TED technology.  The BTM system maintains the temperature of the lithium-ion battery or other advanced chemistry battery within an acceptable temperature range without the use of chilled liquids or refrigerant loops, making it a light weight, highly scalable, compact solution ideal for automotive applications. Gentherm’s proprietary BTM system is compact and energy efficient, resulting in a minimal energy budget, which is important for an electrified vehicle.  The performance improvements realized with this product have been validated through the award of production BTM systems by two flagship original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). We are currently working with other OEMs in an effort to secure more production contracts.

Heated and Cooled Sleep Systems 
 Our heated and cooled sleep system solution incorporates our proprietary Climate Control Sleep SystemTM (“CCSS”) technology. The CCSS represents an adaptation of the TED technology used in our active CCS system. The CCSS directs warmed or cooled air to the surface of a mattress through our proprietary air distribution system. Two independently controlled temperature zones have their own heat or cool settings for a personalized microclimate sleep environment. There are five available settings in each of the heat and cool modes as well as an ambient setting. The sleep system is controlled by the user through a Master Control Unit or hand-held remote controls. In addition, our Heat Vent Sleep System (HVSS) provides similar comfort features at a lower price point. Integration solutions for both CCSS and HVSS exist for foam, innerspring and air bed mattresses and we are working with mattress manufacturers and retailers to bring CCSS technology to markets around the world. Beds featuring CCSS technology is available from Symbol Mattress and their brand SleepFreshTM  (www.sleepfreshbeds.com).
 Heated and Cooled Office Chair 
 Gentherm has adapted our innovative automotive-grade thermal technology to office chairs. Our design and integration solutions provide personalized temperature control whether at home or in the office. With the ability to provide heat or cool to one or both of the back and seat surfaces, we are able to provide manufactures and retailers a range of product and pricing options that best meets their customers’ needs. Combined with our occupant sensor switch, the rechargeable lithium-ion battery is capable of providing over 8 hours of thermally controlled comfort, granting users the freedom of movement without being tethered by an electrical cord. Office chairs featuring our technology are currently marketed and sold by National Business Furniture and Klӧber, and are also available at www.amazon.com.
Heated Lift Assist Chair
 Gentherm’s heated seat technology has recently been added to a lift assist chair. The chair, produced by Windermere Motion and marketed as the Ultimate Power ReclinerTM (www.ultimatepowerrecliner.com), uses dual zones allowing for the back and seat/legs to be set at different temperatures. The chair is available through Windermere Motion’s network of dealers.
 Sponsored Research
In April 2016, the Company was selected as a subcontractor in a U.S. Air Force sponsored program award for the engineering and development of a non-invasive warming and cooling device. The device will be incorporated as medical equipment in the Air Force Expeditionary Medicine Support and Air Force Theater Hospital units supporting overseas contingency operations. Once operational testing is complete and the manufacturing processes for initial production are fully matured, the device will be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for certification. The 30-month, $5.7 million project will be fully funded by the U.S. Air Force. As a subcontractor, Gentherm’s share of the award is approximately $2.6 million. Gentherm received $1.2 million and $300,000 in program funding during 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 During 2015, Gentherm was selected by the U.S. Navy to lead the development of an energy efficient, portable patient warming system based on proprietary thermal management technologies. The objectives for the program include improving the current standard of care for patient warming in support of expeditionary health services and advanced medical development.  The patient warming system is intended to be compatible with existing medical care systems and will be used for treating patients in field hospitals or in transport by ground, ship or air to traditional, better-equipped treatment centers.  Our approach, which is based on new research, leverages the body’s natural methods for thermal exchange and temperature management.  The $2.75 million project was granted a one-year extension and is fully funded by the U.S. Navy.  Total funding received from this program during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $836,000, $1.1 million and $140,000, respectively. The portion of funding pertaining to Gentherm’s project contributions  during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $648,000, $403,000 and $140,000, respectively.
 Marketing, Customers and Sales 
 Our Automotive segment customers include light vehicle OEMs, commercial vehicle OEMs, and first tier (“Tier 1”) suppliers to the automotive OEMs, including automotive seat manufacturers.  We also directly supply CCS and seat heaters to aftermarket seat distributors and installers. 
 9

The Company’s automotive marketing is directed primarily at automotive manufacturers and their Tier 1 suppliers and focuses on the enhanced value consumers attribute to vehicles with seat comfort, thermal convenience and interior comfort products.  If interested, the manufacturers direct us to work with their suppliers to integrate our products into the vehicle’s seat or interior design. These customers will sell our product, as a component of an entire seat or seating system, to automotive OEMs. Once the integration work is complete, prototypes are sent to the manufacturer for evaluation and testing. If a manufacture accepts our product, a program can then be launched for a particular model on a production basis, but it normally takes two to three years from the time a manufacturer decides to include any of our products in a vehicle model to actual volume production for that vehicle. During this process, we derive funding from prototype sales but obtain no significant revenue until mass production begins. Inherent to the automotive supplier market are costs and commitments that are incurred well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers.
 As automobile products comprise a majority of our current revenue, the volume of products we sell is significantly affected by the levels of new vehicle sales and the general business conditions in the automotive industry. 
 For 2017, our revenues from sales to our three largest customers, Lear, Adient and Bosch Automotive were $192,756,000, $173,964,000, and $75,370,000, respectively, representing 20%, 18%, and 8% of our total revenues, respectively. Revenues from Adient and Lear represent sales of our seat comfort, thermal convenience and interior comfort products.  Revenues from Bosch represent product sales based on our automobile cable system technology and are used primarily in the production of automotive oxygen sensors. The loss of any one of these customers is likely to have a material adverse impact on our business; however, as noted above, our strategy is to market our seat comfort and thermal convenience products to the OEMs who then direct their suppliers, such as Adient and Lear, to work with us.  Therefore it is relevant to understand how our revenues are divided among the OEMs, as shown below. 
 Our revenues, including those from sales of our automotive cable systems products, for each of the past three years were divided among automotive OEMs as follows: 
 
 
Manufacturer | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 2015
--------------------------+------+-----+---+------+-----+-----
General Motors | | 15 | % | | 18 | % | 18 | %
Ford Motor Company | | 11 | | | 12 | | 13 | 
Volkswagen | | 10 | | | 10 | | 10 | 
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles | | 9 | | | 10 | | 10 | 
Hyundai | | 8 | | | 10 | | 12 | 
Honda | | 6 | | | 6 | | 4 | 
Renault/Nissan | | 6 | | | 6 | | 6 | 
BMW | | 5 | | | 6 | | 6 | 
Daimler | | 4 | | | 4 | | 4 | 
Toyota Motor Corporation | | 4 | | | 4 | | 4 | 
Jaguar/Land Rover | | 3 | | | 2 | | 3 | 
Other | | 19 | | | 12 | | 10 | 
Total | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

 Non-automotive revenues of 11% in 2017, 8% in 2016 and 6% for 2015 are included within the Other category.  
 Our power generation systems are used by oil and gas customers for cathodic pipeline protection and other remote applications around the world.  
 Patient temperature management systems customers include hospitals and other health care service providers.  Customers purchase our products at prices negotiated by exclusive medical equipment distributors or, if they are a named participant, a group purchasing organization.
 Our environmental testing equipment and testing services are sold to a wide variety of customer in many different industries.
 We supply heated and cooled sleep systems to mattress manufactures and their distribution channels and heated and cooled office chairs to catalog and on-line retailers.  
 10

Our non-automotive electronics products are sold to a variety of industrial customers, including an elevator door manufacturer and an irrigation systems company.
 Outsourcing, Production and Suppliers 
 Our global manufacturing facilities are located close to our key customers.  Our European manufacturing operations are located at our Hungarian, Macedonian and Ukrainian sites. In North America, we operate two manufacturing production sites in Acuña, Mexico, one in Celaya, Mexico, one in Cincinnati, Ohio, one in Alberta, Canada and one in Ontario, Canada. In Asia, we operate production facilities in Langfang, China, and Ha Nam, Vietnam and two electronics production facilities in Shenzhen, China. We continue to grow our in-house manufacturing capabilities, reducing the number of components outsourced to contract manufacturers.  
 We rely on various domestic and foreign vendors and suppliers to supply components for our products through purchase orders, with no guaranteed supply arrangements. Components for certain products, including TEDs, are only available from a limited number of suppliers in the world. The loss of any significant supplier, in the absence of a timely and satisfactory alternative arrangement, or an inability to obtain essential components on reasonable terms or at all, could materially adversely affect our business, operations and cash flows. Our business and operations could also be materially adversely affected by delays in deliveries from our suppliers. 
 Proprietary Rights and Patents 
 The development of new technologies is critical to the execution of our business strategy. Patents obtained for new technologies form an important basis for the success of the Company and underpin the success of our research and development efforts. We have adopted a policy of obtaining, where practical, the exclusive rights to use technology related to our products through patents or licenses for proprietary technologies or processes. We adapt and commercialize such technologies in products for mass production. We also have developed technologies or furthered the development of acquired technologies through internal research and development efforts. 
 As of December 31, 2017, Gentherm held 565 issued patents, of which 233 were U.S. patents and 332 were non-U.S. patents.  A total of 27 patents were held jointly with other companies.  Gentherm held 399 patents directed to climate control products and thermoelectric technologies, 126 patents directed at heating elements and technologies, 26 patents directed to air moving devices, 13 patents directed at patient temperature management systems and 1 patent directed at refrigeration systems technologies.
 Competition 
 The automotive components and systems business is highly competitive. We have several important competitors in the heated seat business and certain vehicle manufacturers have, for some time, offered options on certain models that combine heated seats with circulation of ambient air or cooled air from the car’s air conditioning system which works similar to our heated and ventilated seat system products.  It is possible that our competitors will be able to expand or modify their current products to more directly compete with our CCS products. We believe that there are other potential competitors that are working to develop systems for heating and cooling of automotive car seats. 
 We may experience additional competition directly from automobile manufacturers or other major suppliers, most of which have the capability to manufacture competing products. We believe that our products will compete successfully on the basis of performance, quality, and price.
 Additionally, we may experience competition from non-traditional participants that introduce new technologies, such as advanced driver assistance technologies, as well as new products or services, such as autonomous vehicles, car- and ride-sharing and transportation as a service.
 See “Risk Factors” for further information regarding the significant competition in the automotive industry.
 Our power generation systems compete with other technologies, such as photovoltaic solar panels and fuel cells, to deliver power to different types of oil and gas market applications.  Our products have earned a reputation for delivering highly reliable power under extreme climatic and weather conditions to locations that do not offer access to an electrical grid.  In addition to quality and 
 11

performance, our ability to design and support custom solutions that integrate directly with an application’s existing infrastructure gives our products a competitive advantage over products based on other technologies.
 The patient temperature management market has seven segments: convective warming, blood warming, fluid warming, surface warming, invasive warming, non-invasive cooling and invasive cooling.  Gentherm specializes in the convective warming, blood warming, surface warming and non-invasive cooling.  We compete based on the quality of our products and service to our customers and are working to develop and market the next generation of advanced temperature management systems that complies with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other government regulatory bodies. 
 Gentherm’s environment test chamber business competes globally on the basis of performance, customization, quality and service. Our ability to modify our standard product lines to meet customer specifications helps differentiate Gentherm’s chambers from other competitive offerings. 
 Risk Attendant to Foreign Operations
 We internally manufacture the majority of our products at our production facilities in foreign countries.  Other products we sell are manufactured by third parties in foreign countries.  See “Risk Factors” for a description of risks attendant to our foreign operations.
 See Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Company’s segment revenues by geographic composition.
 Seasonality 
 Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for model year changeovers and in December when many customer plants close for the holidays. See Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for selected quarterly financial data. Employees
