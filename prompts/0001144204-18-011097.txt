Item 1. Business
 
History and Development of the Company
 
We are a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. As of December 31, 2017, we had 25 ships with approximately 50,400 Berths. We plan to introduce seven additional ships through 2025 and we have an option to introduce two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027, subject to certain conditions.
 
Norwegian commenced operations from Miami in 1966. In February 2000, Genting HK acquired control of and subsequently became the sole owner of the Norwegian operations.
 
In January 2008, the Apollo Holders acquired 50% of the outstanding ordinary share capital of NCLC. As part of this investment, the Apollo Holders assumed control of NCLC’s Board of Directors. Also, in January 2008, the TPG Viking Funds acquired, in the aggregate, 12.5% of NCLC’s outstanding share capital from the Apollo Holders.
 
In February 2011, NCLH, a Bermuda limited company, was formed with the issuance to the Sponsors of, in aggregate, 10,000 ordinary shares, with a par value of $.001 per share. In January 2013, NCLH completed its IPO, pursuant to which it sold 27,058,824 ordinary shares for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses, of approximately $473.9 million. In connection with the consummation of the IPO, the Sponsors’ ordinary shares in NCLC were exchanged for the ordinary shares of NCLH, and NCLH became the owner of 100% of the ordinary shares and parent company of NCLC (the “Corporate Reorganization”). At the same time, NCLH contributed $460.0 million to NCLC and the historical financial statements of NCLC became those of NCLH. The Corporate Reorganization was effected solely for the purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure. NCLH had not, prior to the completion of the Corporate Reorganization, conducted any activities other than those incidental to its formation and to prepare for the Corporate Reorganization and the IPO.
 
In November 2014, we completed the Acquisition of Prestige. We believe that the combination of Norwegian and Prestige creates a cruise operating company with a rich product portfolio and strong market presence.
 
The Sponsors have completed numerous Secondary Equity Offerings and as of December 31, 2017 have reduced their ownership to 16.8% of NCLH’s ordinary shares.
 
Additional Information
 
NCLH is a Bermuda exempted company formed as a holding company in 2011, with predecessors dating from 1966.

Our Company
 
Business Overview
 
We are a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. As of December 31, 2017, we had 25 ships with approximately 50,400 Berths. We plan to introduce seven additional ships through 2025 and we have an option to introduce two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027, subject to certain conditions. Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Encore are on order for delivery in the spring of 2018 and fall of 2019, respectively. We also have an Explorer Class Ship, Seven Seas Splendor, on order for delivery in the winter of 2020. Project Leonardo will introduce an additional four ships with expected delivery dates through 2025. These additions to our fleet (exclusive of the option for two additional ships) will increase our total Berths to approximately 72,300. Our brands offer itineraries to worldwide destinations including Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Africa, Canada, Bermuda, Caribbean, Alaska and Hawaii. Norwegian’s U.S.-flagged ship, Pride of America, provides the industry’s only entirely inter-island itinerary in Hawaii.
 
All of our brands offer an assortment of features, amenities and activities, including a variety of accommodations, multiple dining venues, bars and lounges, spa, casino and retail shopping areas and numerous entertainment choices. All brands also offer a selection of shore excursions at each port of call as well as hotel packages for stays before or after a voyage.
 
An innovator in cruise travel, Norwegian operates 15 ships that have been purpose-built to offer guests the freedom and flexibility to design their ideal cruise vacation on their schedule. Norwegian invites guests to enjoy a relaxed, resort style cruise vacation on some of the newest and most contemporary ships at sea with a wide variety of accommodation options, including, on certain ships, The Haven by Norwegian®, a luxury enclave with suites, private pools and dining, concierge service and personal butlers, that offers a

“ship within a ship” experience. The additional ships that we plan to add to our Norwegian fleet as part of Project Leonardo will introduce additional innovative features that we believe will further elevate the guest experience. Norwegian has been named “North America’s Leading Cruise Line” for the second time, along with being honored as the “Caribbean’s Leading Cruise Line” for the fifth consecutive year and “Europe’s Leading Cruise Line” for the tenth consecutive year at the 2017 World Travel Awards. In 2016, Norwegian also received awards for “World’s Leading Large Ship Cruise Line” for the fifth consecutive year and “Europe’s Responsible Tourism Award” for the second consecutive year and the award for “World’s Best Cruise Spa” for the Mandara Spa® on board Norwegian Cruise Line.
 
Oceania Cruises offers the finest cuisine at sea and immersive destination experiences with destination-rich itineraries spanning the globe. Oceania Cruises operates a fleet of six mid-size ships, including two 1,250-Berth O-Class Ships, and four 684-Berth R-Class Ships. Oceania Cruises is ranked as one of the world’s best cruise lines by Condé Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure. Oceania Cruises was awarded “Best Cabins,” “Best Dining,” “Best Fitness & Recreation,” “Best Public Rooms” and “Best Service” in the Cruise Critic Cruisers’ Choice Awards for 2017 and “Best Luxury Cruise Line for Dining” in Cruise Critic Cruisers’ 2016 Editors’ Picks along with “Best for Food,” “Best for On-Shore Excursions” and “Best for Suites” in the 2016 Town & Country Cruise Awards. Also in 2017, Ensemble Travel ® Group awarded Oceania Cruises “Cruise Partner of the Year” and “Marketing Partner of the Year.”
 
Regent Seven Seas Cruises is an all-inclusive cruise line which provides all-suite accommodations, round-trip air transportation, highly personalized service, specialized cuisine, fine wines and spirits, unlimited internet access, sightseeing excursions in every port and other amenities included in the cruise fare. The brand operates four award-winning ships, totaling 2,640 Berths. Condé Nast Traveler named Regent Seven Seas Cruises on its 2017 Gold List and among the World’s Best Medium- and Small-Ships Cruise Lines in its 2016 Readers’ Choice Awards. Regent Seven Seas Cruises also consistently places in Travel + Leisure’s top 5 Best Ocean Cruise Lines with Midsized Ships and tops U.S. News & World Report’s best cruise lines rankings. In 2016, Cruise Critic recognized Seven Seas Explorer as the Best New Luxury Ship and Porthole Cruise Magazine recognized Seven Seas Explorer as the Best Luxury Ship. In 2017, TravAlliance recognized Seven Seas Explorer as the Best Luxury Ship.

Our Competitive Strengths 
 
We believe that the following business strengths will enable us to execute our strategy:
 
Rich Stateroom Mix
 
The Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent fleets offer an attractive mix of staterooms, suites and villas. Norwegian’s accommodations include the groundbreaking Studio staterooms designed for solo travelers centered around the Studio Lounge, a private lounge area solely for Studio guests, as well as ocean views, balconies, and connecting accommodations to meet the needs of all types of cruisers. Norwegian’s suites range from two bedroom family suites to penthouses and owner suites, as well as three bedroom Garden Villas measuring up to 6,694 square feet. In addition, nine of Norwegian’s ships offer The Haven, a key-card access enclave on the upper decks with luxurious suite accommodations, exclusive amenities, and 24/7 butler and concierge service. The Haven suites surround a private courtyard with pool, hot tubs, sundeck, fitness center and steam rooms. Onboard Norwegian Epic, the Breakaway Class Ships and the Breakaway Plus Class Ships, The Haven also includes a private lounge and fine dining restaurant.
 
The spacious and elegant accommodations on Oceania Cruises’ six award-winning ships, the 684-Berth Regatta, Insignia, Sirena and Nautica, and the 1,250-Berth Marina and Riviera, range from 160-square foot inside staterooms to opulent 2,030-square foot owner suites. The Regent fleet is comprised of four ships — Seven Seas Voyager, Seven Seas Mariner and Seven Seas Explorer feature all-suite, all-balcony accommodations and a majority of the accommodations on Seven Seas Navigator include balconies.
 
High-Quality Service
 
The Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent brands all offer a high level of onboard service. We collaborate amongst the brands to provide an enhanced guest experience across all brands. Norwegian offers guests the freedom and flexibility to design their ideal cruise vacation on their schedule with no set dining times, a variety of entertainment options and no formal dress codes. Oceania Cruises and Regent are known for their quality of service, including some of the highest crew-to-guest ratios in the industry and a staff trained to deliver personalized and attentive service in a country club, casual setting.
 
Diverse Selection of Premium Itineraries
 
We have expanded our already broad range of premium itineraries. Our fleet has a worldwide deployment, offering a few days to 180-day itineraries, including destinations in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, the Greek Isles, Alaska, Canada and New England, Asia, Tahiti and the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, Africa, India, South America, the Panama Canal, and the Caribbean. We introduced a new destination, Harvest Caye, in November 2016. This destination in Southern Belize features Belize’s only cruise ship pier, expansive seven acre white sand beach, 15,000 sq. ft. pool with swim up bar, multiple dining options and a nature center with wildlife experiences plus adventure tours.
Strong Cash Flow
 
We believe our business model will generate a significant amount of cash flow with high revenue visibility. All three of our brands afford the ability to pre-sell tickets, receive customer deposits and sell onboard activities in advance with long lead times ahead of sailing. In terms of newbuild capital expenditures, the cash flow impact is mitigated as we have obtained export credit financing for the ships which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2025, subject to certain conditions.

Highly Experienced Management Team
 
Our senior management team is comprised of executives with extensive experience in the cruise, travel, leisure and hospitality-related industries. Frank J. Del Rio is our President and Chief Executive Officer of NCLH. He has been successful in leading the integration of Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent brands. Prior to this, he had been responsible for the financial and strategic development of Prestige. Mr. Del Rio founded Oceania Cruises in October 2002 and played a vital role in the development of Renaissance Cruises from 1993 to 2001. Andrew Stuart is our President and Chief Executive Officer of our Norwegian brand. Mr. Stuart joined Norwegian in 1988 and has held several Senior Management positions in Sales, Marketing and Passenger Services during his tenure before becoming President and Chief Executive Officer. Robert Binder is our Vice Chairman for the Oceania Cruises and Regent brands and President and Chief Executive Officer, Oceania Cruises brand and Jason M. Montague is our President and Chief Executive Officer for the Regent brand. Mr. Binder and Mr. Montague were instrumental in launching Oceania Cruises in 2002 and are widely regarded as its co-founders. Robin Lindsay is our Executive Vice President, Vessel Operations, for NCLH since January 2015. Mr. Lindsay was instrumental in the extensive refurbishment and launch of Oceania Cruises’ Regatta, Insignia and Nautica and the development of the Marina and Riviera. For more on our senior management, see “Executive Officers” below.
Our Business Strategies 
 
Driving Demand
 
We seek to attract vacationers to our products and services in several ways, including:
 

· | delivering an enhanced, value-added vacation experience to our guests relative to other vacation alternatives via our market-to-fill strategy;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | creating diverse and unique itineraries in new and existing markets for our current and upcoming ships;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | utilizing effective marketing and sales force initiatives; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | expanding internationally.
--+---------------------------

 
Our market-to-fill strategy, itinerary diversification, marketing and sales force initiatives and international expansion strategies contribute to driving increased revenues for our fleet. Our market-to-fill strategy maintains pricing integrity by offering both the best price early in the booking cycle and value-added promotions when necessary to mitigate the need to compromise on price.
 
Diversification of deployment is achieved by our destination management team which reviews deployments across the fleet, either repositioning ships to new destinations or fine-tuning itineraries, with the goal of creating product scarcity which, in turn, leads to higher pricing.
 
We also seek to increase demand through effective marketing campaigns across various channels such as branding campaigns on nationwide television or targeted mail campaigns aimed at supporting seasonal deployments. Our sales forces are also drivers of demand, particularly in terms of educating travel agents on our products and services in order for them to better sell to potential vacationers.
 
Lastly, our international expansion efforts are aimed at increasing brand awareness across the globe which allows us to diversify our guest sourcing.  We maintain numerous sales offices which support sales and marketing efforts in various markets outside of North America including the United Kingdom, Europe, China, Australia, Brazil, India, Japan and Singapore. 
 
Leveraging Scale to Suppress Costs
 
We continue to leverage the combined purchasing power of our three brands to reduce costs throughout the organization. This initiative is bolstered by our Supply Chain and Logistics Management function which supports our three brands as well as our corporate and international offices.
Enhanced Product Offerings and Guest Experience
 
Norwegian’s ships offer up to 28 dining options, a diverse range of accommodations and what we believe is the widest array of entertainment at sea. Oceania Cruises’ award-winning onboard dining, with multiple open seating dining venues, is a central highlight of its cruise experience. Regent’s all-inclusive offering includes air transportation, shore excursions, hotel packages, specialty restaurants, premium spirits and fine wines, gratuities, wi-fi and other amenities.
Maximize Revenue
 
We focus on growing revenue through various initiatives aimed at increasing ticket prices and Occupancy Percentages as well as onboard spending to drive higher overall revenue. Our specific initiatives include:

8
-

Strategic Relationships. We have strategic relationships with travel agencies and tour operators who commit to purchasing a certain level of inventory with long lead times.
 
Meetings, Incentives and Charters. We maintain our focus on the meetings, incentives and charters channel, which typically books very far in advance and can represent a significant portion of the ship, or even an entire sailing, in one transaction.
Promotional Strategy. With our Norwegian brand, we utilize a more inclusive product offering on certain sailings and in certain cabin selections which provides guests a choice of one to five onboard amenities.
Casino Player Strategy. We have non-exclusive arrangements with over 100 casino partners worldwide whereby loyal gaming guests are offered cruise reward certificates redeemable for cruises. Through property sponsored events and joint marketing programs, we have the opportunity to market cruises to these guests. These arrangements with casino partners have the dual benefit of filling open inventory and reaching guests expected to generate above average onboard revenue through the casino and other onboard spending.
Optimization of Deployment. We manage our ships’ deployment to promote better breadth of itineraries and to offer sailings further in advance.
 
Ship Refurbishments. We have invested in revitalizations to our ships which provides a product which we believe delivers higher guest satisfaction and, in turn, higher pricing.
 
Disciplined Fleet Expansion
 
We have Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Encore on order for delivery in the spring of 2018 and the fall of 2019, respectively. These ships will be the largest in our fleet, each reaching approximately 164,600 Gross Tons. With approximately 3,770 to 4,000 Berths each, they will be similar in design to our first Breakaway Plus Class Ship, Norwegian Escape, which was delivered in October 2015, and will include additional innovative features. We also have a contract to build a second Explorer Class Ship, Seven Seas Splendor to be delivered in the winter of 2020. Project Leonardo consists of four ships on order with expected delivery dates through 2025 with an option for two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027, subject to certain conditions. The four Leonardo ships are each 140,000 gross tons with approximately 3,300 Berths. We have obtained export credit financing for the ships which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2025, subject to certain conditions. We believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding the reach of our brands, positioning us for accelerated growth and providing an optimized return on invested capital.
Expand and Strengthen Our Product Distribution Channels
 
As part of our growth strategy, we continually look for ways to deepen and expand our sales channels. We continue to invest in our brands by enhancing websites and passenger services departments through which travel agents and guests have the ability to book cruise vacations.
 
We focus on distribution through our three primary channels: “Retail/Travel Agent,” “International,” and “Meetings, Incentives and Charters.”
 
Retail/Travel Agent. The retail/travel agent channel represents the majority of our ticket sales. Our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of approximately 23,000 independent travel agencies including brick and mortar, internet-based and home-based operators located in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. We have made substantial investments with improvements in booking technologies, transparent pricing strategies, effective marketing tools, improved communication and cooperative marketing initiatives. We have expanded sales force teams who work closely with our travel agency partners on maximizing their marketing and sales effectiveness across all three of our brands. Our focused account management is designed to create solutions catered to the individual retailer through product and sales training. This education creates a deeper understanding of all our offerings.
 
International.  The international channel represents an underpenetrated channel of distribution and one that we have increased focus on since 2015. Focus on this market accomplishes the dual objective of allowing us to grow our yields and capacity faster than if we only focused on the North American market while also allowing us to diversify our risk.  As part of this focus, we have undertaken a three-pronged strategy of:

· | expanding the management, sales and marketing teams that oversees this area,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | broadening our travel agency distribution to multiple partners in each region, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expanding the geographic reach of our product by deploying our ships in areas that appeal to international guests and by personalizing our product for their tastes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As part of this strategy, we have opened offices in Sydney, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Tokyo, and Singapore and expanded or renovated our existing offices in Southampton, Sao Paulo and Wiesbaden.

For information regarding risks associated with our international operations, see Part I Item 1A-Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor titled “Conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks.”
 
Meetings, Incentives and Charters. This channel focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meetings and incentive travel. These sales often have very long lead times and can fill a significant portion of the ship’s capacity, or even an entire sailing, in one transaction. The acquisition of Sixthman in 2012, a company specializing in developing and delivering music-oriented charters, opened up a new market for travel partners enabling travel partners to sell high-quality music experiences at sea to guests.
Itineraries 
 
We offer cruise itineraries ranging from a few days to 180-days calling on worldwide locations, including destinations in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, the Greek Isles, Alaska, Canada and New England, Asia, Tahiti and the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, Africa, India, South America, the Panama Canal, and the Caribbean. We have developed, and are continuing to develop, innovative itineraries to position our ships in new and niche markets as well as in the mainstream markets throughout the world.
 
We believe that these destination-focused itineraries, complemented by a comprehensive shore excursion program (which is included in the all-inclusive fare for cruises on the Regent ships), differentiate our brands from many of our competitors. We call on varied destinations, many of which include overnight stays in port, allowing guests to have more in-depth experiences than would otherwise be possible in only a single day port call.
 
For some of our longer itineraries, we strive to maximize profitability by selling segments of the longer itineraries as shorter cruises (i.e., which last 7 to 20 days) in order to capture more time-constrained customers. We believe the deployment flexibility created by the use of longer itineraries translates off-peak seasons into more profitable portions of longer cruises. We have bolstered our presence internationally by opening sales offices in Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo and Mumbai which will further increase sourcing from these markets for all three brands.
 
In addition to expanding our international sourcing efforts, we are in the process of deploying our vessels to new destinations around the world. Norwegian Joy homeports year-round in the Asia Pacific region with itineraries that include many of the region’s ports.
 
Additionally, all three of our brands sail to the Republic of Cuba. These sailings began in the spring of 2017, and offer U.S. travelers the opportunity to visit the culturally rich country on select Caribbean sailings that include calls in the historic city of Havana.
 
Passenger Ticket Revenue 
 
We offer our guests a wide variety of cruise fare options when booking a cruise. Our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities, as well as meals and entertainment. In some instances, cruise ticket prices include round-trip airfare to and from the port of embarkation, complimentary beverages, unlimited shore excursions, free internet, pre-cruise hotel packages, and on some of the exotic itineraries pre or post land packages. Prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary, stateroom category selected and the time of year that the voyage takes place.
Onboard and Other Revenue 
 
All three brands generate onboard and other revenue for additional products and services which are not included in the cruise fare, including casino operations, certain food and beverage, gift shop purchases, spa services, photo services and other similar items. Food and beverage, casino operations and shore excursions are generally managed directly by us while retail shops, spa services, art auctions and internet services may be managed through contracts with third-party concessionaires. These contracts generally entitle us to a fixed percentage for the gross sales derived from these concessions. Norwegian’s ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations, meals in certain dining facilities and many onboard activities such as entertainment, pool-side activities, some internet services and various sports programs. Norwegian generates additional revenue on our ships from casino operations, food and beverage, shore excursions, gift shop purchases, spa services, photo services and other similar items. To maximize onboard revenue, Norwegian uses various cross-marketing and promotional tools which are supported by point-of-sale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these products and services. Oceania Cruises’ offerings may include air transportation and certain other amenities. Regent’s offerings typically include air transportation, a pre-cruise hotel night stay (for concierge level and above), premium wines and top shelf liquors, gratuities and unlimited shore excursions. Both Regent and Oceania Cruises generate additional revenue from casino operations, gift shop purchases, premium shore excursions and spa services.
 
Onboard and other revenue accounted for 31%, 30% and 28% of our consolidated revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Revenue Management Practices 
 
Our revenue management function performs extensive analyses in order to determine booking history and trends by sailing, stateroom category, travel partner, market segment, itinerary and distribution channel in order to determine cruise ticket pricing. We concentrate on improving early booking occupancy rates to drive higher Net Yields. We execute targeted and high-frequency marketing campaigns that communicate a message of a value-packed cruise offering in both North American and select international markets. To increase the effectiveness of these targeted marketing programs, we emphasize communication to keep the travel agents engaged and informed and utilize call centers focusing on both inbound calls and outbound calls to high potential targeted customers. This

--

 

marketing strategy assists in maximizing the revenue potential from each customer contact generated by various marketing campaigns. We believe these strategies and other initiatives executed by our distribution channels will drive sustainable growth in the number of guests carried and in Net Yields achieved.
 
Seasonality
 
Our revenue is seasonal and based on the demand for cruises. Historically, the seasonality of the North American cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. This predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations by quarter in our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled Dry-docks, which we typically schedule during non-peak demand periods.
Competition
 
Our primary competition includes operators such as Carnival Corporation & Carnival plc, which owns and operates Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises and Seabourn Cruise Line, among others, and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which owns and operates Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises, among others, as well as other cruise lines such as MSC Cruises, Crystal Cruises, Silversea Cruises and Viking Ocean Cruises. In addition, we compete with land-based vacation alternatives, such as hotels and resorts, vacation ownership properties, casinos, and tourist destinations throughout the world.
 
Sales of cruises and onboard offerings are subject to consumer discretionary spending levels and may be influenced by geopolitical events and economic conditions.
 
Marketing Strategy 
 
Our marketing teams work to enhance brand awareness and increase levels of understanding and consideration of our products and services among consumers and trade and travel partners with the ultimate goal of driving sales. We utilize a multi-channel strategy that may include a combination of print, television, radio, website/e-commerce, direct mail, social media, mobile and e-mail campaigns, partnerships, customer loyalty initiatives, market research, and business-to-business events.
 
Building customer loyalty among our past guests is an important element of our marketing strategy. We believe that attending to the needs and motivations of our past guests creates a cost-effective means of attracting business, particularly to our new ships and itineraries, because past guests are familiar with our brands, products and services and often return to cruise with us. We have shared customer databases across our brands to further enhance our communications with our past guests who receive newsletters and mailings with informative destination and product information and promotional amenities. Continued investments in our websites is also key to ensuring the optimal pre-cruise planning experience offering guests the ability to shop, reserve and purchase a breadth of onboard products and services. We have a strong communications stream that provides customized pre-cruise information to help guests maximize their cruise experience as well as a series of communications to welcome them home and ultimately engage them in booking another cruise.
 
Travel agents are crucial to our marketing and distribution efforts. We provide robust marketing support and enhanced tools for our travel agent partners through a variety of programs. Our travel partners can benefit from our online travel partner education programs that include a wide variety of courses about our ships, itineraries and other best-selling practices. Agents can also easily customize a multitude of consumer marketing materials for their use in promoting our products through our online platform.
 
Guest feedback is also a critically important element in the development of our overall marketing and business strategies. We regularly initiate guest feedback studies among both travel partners and consumers to assess the impact of various programs and/or to solicit information that helps shape future direction.
 
Ship Operations and Cruise Infrastructure
 
Ship Maintenance and Logistics
 
Sophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems support the technical superiority and modern look of our fleet. In addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements, each of our ships is generally taken out of service, approximately every 24 to 60 months, for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work, repairs and improvements performed in Dry-dock. Dry-dock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under IMO requirements reflected in chapters of the International Convention of the Safety of Life at Seas (“SOLAS”) and to some extent the International Load Lines Convention. Under these regulations, it is required that a passenger ship Dry-dock once in five years (depending on age of vessel), twice in 5 years (depending on flag state and age of vessel) and the maximum interval between each Dry-dock cannot exceed 3 years (depending age of vessel and flag state). However, most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the Bahamas and/or Marshall Islands (flag state), as applicable, after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to Dry-dock once every 5 years. To the extent practical, each ship’s crew, catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the Dry-dock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work. Accordingly, Dry-dock work is typically performed during non-peak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service. Dry-docks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability.
Suppliers

Our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition. Our largest operating expenditures are for payroll and related (including our contract with a third party who provides certain crew services), fuel, food and beverage, advertising and marketing and travel agent services. Most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices. In addition, owing to the large quantities that we purchase, we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies. Our purchases are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. Payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry.

Best-in-class guest service levels are paramount in the markets in which we operate, where travelers have discriminating tastes and high expectations for service quality. We have dedicated increasing attention and resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests. Among other initiatives, we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs, with a focus on career development. We believe that our dedication to anticipating and meeting our guests’ every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew, helping to build customer loyalty.
 
We place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and crew. We operate all of our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of SOLAS and International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (“ISM Code”), the international safety standards which govern the cruise industry. Every crew member is well trained in the Company’s stringent safety protocols, participating in regular safety trainings, exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships.
 
Our captains are experienced seafarers. We further ensure that our captains regularly undergo rigorous training on navigation and bridge operations. To assist our captains and officers while at sea, we have extensive navigation protocols in place. Our bridge operations are based on robust navigational procedures and risk analysis. Our bridge teams follow pre-set voyage plans which are thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team prior to port departures and arrivals. In addition, all of our ships employ the latest state-of-the-art navigational equipment and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have the most accurate data regarding the planned itinerary.
 
Prior to every cruise setting sail or upon departure, we hold a mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated. We also show an extensive safety video which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions. Our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems. In recent years, our ships have continuously been upgraded and include internal and external regulatory audits.
 
We have developed Safety Management Systems (“SMS”), which establish policies, procedures, training, qualification, quality, compliance, audit and self-improvement standards for all employees, both shipboard and shoreside. SMS also provides real-time reports and information to support the fleet and risk management decisions. Through these systems, our senior managers, as well as ship management, can focus on consistent, high quality operation of the fleet. Our SMS are approved and audited regularly by our classification society, Lloyds Register, and they also undergo regular internal audits as well as annual/semiannual inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard, flag state and other port and state authorities. We screen and train our crew to ensure crew familiarity and proficiency with the safety equipment onboard. Various safety measures have been implemented on all of our ships and additional personnel have been appointed in our ship operations departments.
 
Insurance
 
We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship. The coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the European and U.S. insurance markets.
 
In addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships, we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business. The insurance we carry includes:
 

· | Protection and indemnity insurance (coverage for passenger, crew and third-party liabilities), including insurance against risk of pollution liabilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | War risk insurance, including terrorist risk insurance. The terms of our war risk policies include provisions where underwriters can give seven days’ notice to the insured that the policies will be cancelled in the event of a change of risk which is typical for policies in the marine industry. Upon any proposed cancellation the insurer shall, before expiry of the seven day period, submit new terms; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Insurance for our shoreside property and general liability risks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that all of our insurance coverage, including those noted above, is subject to market-standard limitations, exclusions and deductible levels.
 
The Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea (1974) (the “Athens Convention”) and the Protocol to the Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea (1976) (the “1976 Protocol”) are generally applicable to passenger ships. The U.S. has not ratified the Athens Convention; however, with limited exceptions, the 1976 Protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to cruises that do not call at a U.S. port. The IMO Diplomatic Conference agreed

to a new protocol to the Athens Convention on November 1, 2002 (the “2002 Protocol”). The 2002 Protocol, which took effect on April 23, 2014, establishes for the first time a level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators with a right of direct action against the insurer. In addition, on December 31, 2012, the European Union (“EU”) Passenger Liability Regulation became effective and requires us to carry a minimum level of financial responsibility per passenger per incident. We believe the amount of our protection and indemnity policy coverage provides the compulsory insurance; however, no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will remain available to provide the level and type of coverage required.
 
Trademarks and Tradenames
 
Under the Norwegian brand, we own a number of registered trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE” and “FEEL FREE,” the names of our ships (except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending), incentive programs and specialty services rendered on our ships and specialty accommodations such as “THE HAVEN BY NORWEGIAN.” In addition, we own registered trademarks relating to the “FREESTYLE” family of names, including, “FREESTYLE CRUISING,” “FREESTYLE DINING” and “FREESTYLE VACATION.” We believe that these trademarks are widely recognized throughout North America, Europe and other areas of the world and have considerable value.
 
Under the Oceania Cruises brand, we own a number of registered trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “OCEANIA CRUISES” and its logo, “REGATTA,” “INSIGNIA,” and “YOUR WORLD. YOUR WAY.”
 
Under the Regent brand, we own registered trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “SEVEN SEAS CRUISES” and “LUXURY GOES EXPLORING” as well as the names of our ships (except where trademark applications have been filed and are pending).
 
We also claim common law rights in trademarks and tradenames used in conjunction with our ships, incentive programs, customer loyalty program and specialty services rendered onboard our ships for each of our brands.
 
The Regent ships have been operating under the Regent brand since 2006. We entered into a trademark license agreement with Regent Hospitality Worldwide, Inc., which we amended in February 2011, granting us the right to use the “Regent” brand family of marks. The amended trademark license agreement allows Regent to use the Regent tradename, in conjunction with cruises, in perpetuity, subject to the terms and conditions in the agreement.
 
Regulatory Issues
 
Registration of Our Ships
 
Seventeen of the ships that we currently operate are registered in the Bahamas. One of our ships, Pride of America, is a U.S.-flagged ship. Seven of our ships are registered in the Marshall Islands. Our ships registered in the Bahamas and the Marshall Islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to Bahamian and Marshall Islands requirements and are subject to International laws and regulations and to various U.S. federal regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. Our U.S.-registered ship is subject to laws and regulations of the U.S. federal government, including, but not limited to, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Department of Labor. The international, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and other legal requirements applicable to our operations change regularly, depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited.
 
Our ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities in the various countries that they visit. Such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety, security, environmental, customs, immigration, health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements.
 
Environmental Protection
 
Our ships are subject to various international, national, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those that govern air emissions, waste discharge, water management and disposal, and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals, solvents and paints. Under such laws and regulations, we are prohibited from discharging certain materials, such as petrochemicals and plastics, into waterways, and we must adhere to various air quality-related requirements.
 
With regard to air quality requirements, the International Maritime Organization’s (“IMO”) convention entitled Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”) has set a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 0.5% (reduced from the current 3.5% global limit) beginning January 2020. Alternative compliance methods, such as the use of alternative fuels, or sulfur scrubbers that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur emissions, may also be utilized. This fuel standard was initially set in 2008 and was reviewed in 2016 to determine the availability of fuel oil to comply with this standard. The review took into account supply and demand in the global fuel oil market, an analysis of trends in fuel oil markets and other relevant issues. The result of the review was to confirm the date of implementation as January 2020.
 
MARPOL also requires stricter limitations on sulfur emissions within designated Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”), which include the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, North American waters and the U.S. Caribbean Sea. Ships operating in these waters are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 0.1% or use approved alternative emission reduction methods. Additional ECAs may also be established in the future, with areas around Norway, Japan, and the Mediterranean Sea being considered.

Ballast water discharges are governed by the MARPOL Ballast Water Management Convention, which came into force in 2017 (“The Convention”), and which governs the discharge of ballast water from ships. Ballast water, which is seawater held onboard ships and used for stabilization, may contain a variety of marine species. The Convention is designed to regulate the treatment and discharge of ballast water to avoid the transfer of marine species to new, different, or potentially unsuitable environments.
 
MARPOL also sets forth requirements for discharges of garbage, oil and sewage from ships, including regulations regarding the ships’ equipment and systems for the control of such discharges, and the provision of port reception facilities for sewage handling. Ships are generally prohibited from discharging sewage into the sea within a specified distance from the nearest land. Governments are required to ensure the provision of adequate reception facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage, without causing delay to ships. Ships are generally required to be equipped with either approved sewage treatment plants, disinfecting systems or sewage holding tanks.
 
Recently adopted amendments to MARPOL will make the Baltic Sea a “Special Area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships will be prohibited. Stricter discharge restrictions will be in effect for new passenger ships in 2019, and for existing passenger ships starting in 2021.
 
These requirements may impact our operations unless suitable port waste facilities are available, or new technologies for onboard waste treatment are developed. Accordingly, the cost of complying with these requirements is not determinable at this time.
 
In the U.S., the Clean Water Act of 1972, and other laws and regulations, provide the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water, bilge water, gray water, anti-fouling paints and other substances during normal operations while a vessel is in inland waters, within three nautical miles of land, and in designated federally-protected waters. The U.S. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) program, authorized by the Clean Water Act, was established to reduce pollution within U.S. territorial waters. For our affected ships, all of the NPDES requirements are set forth in the EPA’s Vessel General Permit (“VGP”). The VGP establishes effluent limits for 26 specific discharge streams incidental to the normal operation of a vessel. In addition to these discharge- and vessel-specific requirements, the VGP includes requirements for inspections, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping.
 
The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, which implements the MARPOL in the U.S., provides for potentially severe civil and criminal penalties related to ship-generated pollution for incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles of land and, in some cases, within the 200-nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (“EEZ”).
 
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) provides for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200-nautical mile EEZ of the U.S., subject to defined monetary limits. OPA 90 requires that in order for us to operate in U.S. waters, we must have Certificates of Financial Responsibility (“COFR”) from the U.S. Coast Guard for each ship.  Our continued OPA 90 certification signifies our ability to meet the requirements for related OPA 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance.
 
Many coastal U.S. states have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law and, in some cases, the laws have no statutory limits of liability. Among the most stringent requirements are those set by the State of Alaska, which has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards. The legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in Alaskan waters.
 
The European Union (“EU”) has also adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at maintaining or improving the quality of the environment. To support the implementation and enforcement of European environmental legislation, the EU has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections.
 
With regard to air emissions from seagoing ships, the EU requires the use of low sulfur (less than 0.1%) marine gas oil in EU ports. Passenger ships on regular service to EU ports (and not operating in an ECA) are required to use fuels containing a maximum sulfur content of 1.5%. The EU has set January 2020 as the compliance date for the 0.5% fuel sulfur limit within their jurisdictional waters.
 
In addition to the existing legal requirements, we are committed to helping to preserve the environment, because a clean, unspoiled environment is a key element that attracts guests to our ships. Furthermore, NCL (Bahamas) Ltd. and NCL (America) LLC are certified under the International Organization for Standardization’s 14001 Standard. This voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system which we have adopted for our operations. Currently we operate under an Environmental Management System that is incorporated into the Company’s SMS.
 
If we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws, regulations or treaties, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws, regulations and treaties. Any fines or other sanctions for violation or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations,

cash flow or financial condition.
 
Permits for Glacier Bay, Alaska 
 
In connection with certain Alaska cruise operations, we rely on concession permits from the U.S. National Park Service to operate our ships in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. We currently hold a concession permit allowing for 22 calls per summer cruising season through September 30, 2019. However, there can be no assurance that such permit will be renewed when necessary or that regulations relating to the renewal of such permit will remain unchanged in the future.
 
Passenger Well-Being
 
In the U.S., we must meet the U.S. Public Health Service’s requirements, which include vessel ratings by inspectors from the Vessel Sanitation Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We rate at the top of the range of CDC and FDA scores achieved by the major cruise lines. In addition, the cruise industry and the U.S. Public Health Service have agreed on regulations for food, water and hygiene, aimed at proactively protecting the health of travelers and preventing illness transmission to U.S. ports.
 
Security and Safety
 
The IMO has adopted safety standards as part of the SOLAS convention, which apply to all of our ships. SOLAS establishes requirements for vessel design, structural features, construction methods and materials, refurbishment standards, life-saving equipment, fire protection and detection, safe management and operation and security in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew. All of our crew undergo regular security and safety training exercises that meet all international and national maritime regulations.
 
SOLAS requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (“ISM Code”). All of our ships are certified as to compliance with the ISM Code. Each such certificate is granted for a five-year period and is subject to periodic verification.
 
The SOLAS requirements are amended and extended by the IMO from time to time. For example, the International Port and Ship Facility Code (“ISPS Code”) was adopted by the IMO in December 2002 with the goal of strengthening maritime security by placing new requirements on governments, port authorities and shipping companies.
 
Amendments to SOLAS required that ships constructed in accordance with pre-1974 SOLAS requirements install automatic sprinkler systems. IMO adopted an amendment to SOLAS which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of non-combustible construction. The SOLAS regulation implemented Long-Range Identification and Tracking. All of our ships are in compliance with the requirements of SOLAS as amended and/or as applicable to the keel-laying date.
 
In addition to the requirements of the ISPS Code, the U.S. Congress enacted the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) which implements a number of security measures at ports in the U.S. including measures that apply to ships registered outside the U.S. while docking at ports in the U.S. The U.S. Coast Guard has published MTSA regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the U.S., provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships. The Transportation Workers Identification Credential is a U.S. requirement for accessibility into and onto U.S. ports and U.S.-flagged ships.
 
Maritime-Labor
 
In 2006, the International Labor Organization (“ILO”), an agency of the United Nations that develops and oversees international labor standards, adopted a new Consolidated Maritime Labor Convention (“MLC 2006”). MLC 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the ILO since 1920. MLC 2006 includes a broad range of requirements, such as a broader definition of a seafarer, minimum age of seafarers, medical certificates, recruitment practices, training, repatriation, food, recreational facilities, health and welfare, hours of work and rest, accommodations, wages and entitlements. MLC 2006 added requirements not previously in effect, in the areas of occupational safety and health. MLC 2006 became effective in certain countries commencing August 2013. The Standard of Training Certification and Watch Keeping for Seafarers (“STCW”), as amended, establishes minimum standards relating to training, certification and watch-keeping for our seafarers.
 
Financial Requirements
 
The Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”) requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of U.S. ports to indemnify passengers in the event of non-performance of the transportation. Accordingly, each of our three brands are required to maintain a $30.0 million third-party performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for non-performance of transportation and other obligations to passengers. The guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price index-based adjustments. Also, our brands have a legal requirement to maintain a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the U.K. As of December 31, 2017, approximately British Pound Sterling 11.8 million was in place as a security guarantee. We also are required to establish financial responsibility by other jurisdictions to meet liability in the event of non-performance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions.
 
From time to time, various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an

effect on our operations in the U.S. and the cruise industry in general.
 
For information regarding risks associated with our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, see Part I Item 1A-Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor titled “We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue.”
 
Taxation 
 
U.S. Income Taxation
 
The following discussion is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below.
 
Exemption of International Shipping Income under Section 883 of the Code
 
Under Section 883 of the Code (“Section 883”) and the related regulations, a foreign corporation will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation on its U.S.-source income derived from the international operation of ships (“shipping income”) if: (a) it is organized in a qualified foreign country, which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the U.S. in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under Section 883; and (b) either: (1) more than 50% of the value of its stock is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by qualified shareholders, which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country; (2) one or more classes of its stock representing, in the aggregate, more than 50% of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the U.S. (the “publicly traded test”); or (3) it is a “controlled foreign corporation” (a “CFC”) for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50% of its stock is owned by qualified U.S. persons for more than half of the taxable year (the “CFC test”). In addition, U.S. Treasury Regulations require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements.
 
NCLH is incorporated in Bermuda, a qualified foreign country which grants an equivalent exemption, and NCLH meets the publicly traded test because its ordinary shares were primarily and regularly traded on the Nasdaq until December 18, 2017 and have been primarily and regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) since December 19, 2017. Both the Nasdaq and the NYSE are considered to be established securities markets in the U.S. Therefore, we believe that NCLH qualifies for the benefits of Section 883.
 
We believe and have taken the position that substantially all of NCLH’s income, including the income of its ship-owning subsidiaries, is properly categorized as shipping income, and that we do not have a material amount of non-qualifying income. It is possible, however, that the IRS interpretation of shipping income could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify (or will not qualify) as shipping income. Moreover, the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under Section 883. There are factual circumstances beyond our control, including changes in the direct and indirect owners of NCLH’s ordinary shares, which could cause NCLH or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under Section 883. Further, any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income, and we can give no assurances on this matter.
 
Under certain circumstances, changes in the identity, residence or holdings of NCLH’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause NCLH’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under Section 883. Therefore, as a precautionary matter, NCLH has provided protections in its bye-laws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly traded test by prohibiting any person, other than the Sponsors, from owning, directly, indirectly or constructively, more than 4.9% of NCLH’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by NCLH’s Board of Directors (the “4.9% limit”). Any outstanding shares held in excess of the 4.9% limit will be transferred to and held in a trust.
 
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, Regent and its non-U.S. subsidiaries are disregarded as entities separate from their immediate foreign parent (PCH) and Oceania Cruises is treated as a corporation. For 2015, 2016 and 2017 both Regent and Oceania Cruises relied on NCLH’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of Section 883 as discussed above.
 
Taxation of International Shipping Income Where Section 883 of the Code is Inapplicable
 
Unless exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, a foreign corporation is subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the U.S. If we fail to qualify for the exemption under Section 883 in respect of our U.S.-sourced shipping income, or if the provision was repealed, then we will be subject to taxation in the U.S. on such income.
 
Generally, “shipping income” is any income that is derived from the use of vessels, from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time, voyage or Bareboat Charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses. For these purposes, shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the U.S., which we refer to as “U.S.- source shipping income,” will be considered to be 50% derived from sources within the U.S.
 

16
--

 

If we do not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if the provision was repealed, then any U.S.-sourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected income would be subject to federal corporate income taxation on a net basis (generally at a 35% rate, 21% rate effective January 1, 2018) and state and local taxes, and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax of 30%, unless a lower treaty rate applies (the “Net Tax Regime”). Our U.S. source shipping income is considered effectively connected income if we have, or are considered to have, a fixed place of business in the U.S. involved in the earning of U.S. source shipping income, and substantially all of our U.S. source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the U.S.
 
If we do not have a fixed place of business in the U.S. or substantially all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation, the income will generally not be considered to be effectively connected income. In that case, we would be subject to a special 4% tax on our U.S. source shipping income (the “4% Tax Regime”).
 
Other United States Taxation
 
U.S. Treasury Regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and, to the extent derived from U.S. sources, are subject to U.S. federal income taxes under the Net Tax Regime discussed above. Income items considered non-incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of single-day cruises, shore excursions, air and other transportation, and pre- and post-cruise land packages. We believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income.
 
Income from U.S.-flagged Operation under the NCL America
 
Income derived from our U.S.-flagged operation generally will be subject to U.S. corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels. We expect that such income will not be subject to U.S. branch profits tax nor a U.S. dividend withholding tax under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty.
 
U.K. Income Taxation
 
As a result of a restructuring, NCLH and NCLC became tax residents of the U.K. and are subject to normal U.K. corporation tax.
 
U.S. Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels
 
Gains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt from tax under Section 883 provided NCLH qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 in respect of our shipping income. If, however, our gain does not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if the provision was repealed, then such gain could be subject to either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Tax Regime.
Certain State, Local and Non-U.S. Tax Matters
 
We may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property, or operations involving foreign property may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.
Changes in Tax Laws
 
The various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. For example, legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from U.S. federal income tax under Section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the U.S. Moreover, we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty on income derived in respect of our U.S.-flagged operation.
 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. Among other provisions, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 118, which addresses how a company recognizes provisional amounts when a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes in the Act. The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year. As of December 31, 2017, we have not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, as described below, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances. These amounts are provisional and subject to change. The most significant impact of the Act for the Company was a $7.4 million reduction of the value of net deferred tax liabilities (which represent future tax expenses) that was recorded as a discrete tax benefit as a result of lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The tax benefit represents a provisional amount and the Company’s current best estimate. Any adjustments recorded to the provisional amount through the end of 2018 will be included in income from operations as an adjustment to tax expense. The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the Company’s current

interpretation of the Act and may change as the Company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance. Other aspects of the Act are either not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 3,000 full-time employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 28,000 shipboard employees. Regent and Oceania Cruises’ ships also utilize a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant employees onboard. We refer you to “Risk Factors—Amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining agreements that are currently in place.
Ports and Facilities 
 
We own a private island in the Bahamas, Great Stirrup Cay, which we utilize as a port-of-call on certain itineraries. We have also developed a cruise destination in Belize, Harvest Caye, which we introduced in November 2016. In addition, we have entered into various agreements relating to port or berthing rights for our ships, which include the following:

· | an agreement with the Government of Bermuda whereby we are permitted weekly calls in Bermuda through 2022 from Boston and New York.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | contracts with the Port of New Orleans, PortMiami, Port Canaveral and the Port of Tampa pursuant to which we receive preferential Berths to the exclusion of other vessels for certain specified days of the week at the cities’ cruise ship terminals.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a concession permit with the U.S. National Park Service whereby our ships are permitted to call on Glacier Bay during each summer cruise season through September 30, 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Segment Reporting 
 
We have concluded that our business has a single reportable segment. Each brand, Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment. Our operating segments have similar economic and qualitative characteristics, including similar long-term margins and similar products and services; therefore, we aggregate all of the operating segments into one reportable segment.
 
Although we sell cruises on an international basis, our passenger ticket revenue is primarily attributed to U.S.-sourced guests who make reservations in the U.S. Revenue attributable to U.S.-sourced guests was 77%, 81% and 75% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No other individual country’s revenues exceeded 10% in any of our last three years.
 
Revenues by destination were as follows (in thousands):
 

 | Year Ended December 31, |

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2015
North America | $ | 3,285,903 | | $ | 3,132,208 | | $ | 2,743,007
