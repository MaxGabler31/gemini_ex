General Overview
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 21, 2009, under the name Mokita Exploration, Ltd. The Company originally intended to develop its business as a mineral exploration company, however, due to the low supply of potentially profitable mining properties, our company abandoned its original plan and restructured its business strategy. The Company then focused its efforts on developing a business as a provider of credit card payment services for Canadian customers. To reflect the Company’s new focus, on February 5, 2010, it filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation changing our name to Mokita, Inc. 
 
The board decided to enter the oil and gas industry, seeking out viable options to create value for our shareholders. On July 20, 2011, it filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation changing the name to Mokita Ventures, Inc., to reflect the company’s new business plan. The name change to Mokita Ventures, Inc. was subsequently rejected by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and accordingly, on May 30, 2013, it filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to restore its name to Mokita, Inc.
 
On February 27, 2014, there was a change of control of the Company. On February 28, 2014, the board of directors and a majority of holders of the Company’s voting securities approved a change of name of the Company to MediJane Holdings Inc. A Certificate of Amendment to effect the change of name was filed and became effective with the Nevada Secretary of State on March 4, 2014. A Certificate of Correction was subsequently filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on March 6, 2014 to correct a spelling error in the Company’s new name. These amendments have been reviewed by FINRA and were approved for filing with an effective date of March 10, 2014. The name change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on March 10, 2014 under the new ticker symbol “MJMD”.

On March 8, 2017 the Company filed an Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of Nevada. As a result of the Amendment, the Company changed its name with the State of Nevada from Medijane Holdings, Inc. to Stem Bioscience, Inc.
 
In May 2018 the Company again changed its name to Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited. A Certificate of Amendment to effect the change of name was filed and became effective with the Nevada Secretary of State on May 31, 2018. The name change was accepted by FINRA and became effective with the Over-the- Counter Bulletin Board on November 2, 2018 with the trading symbol “PLSI”.
 
Our Business
 After the change of control on February 27, 2014, the Company became a medical delivery systems company with a pharmaceutical approach to cannabinoid treatment of various illnesses with medical marijuana.
 
License Agreement. On March 14, 2014, the Company entered into a license agreement with Phoenix Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“Phoenix Bio Pharm”). Pursuant to the license agreement, Phoenix Bio Pharm has granted to the Company an exclusive license for the territory of North America to exploit all presently owned and after-acquired intellectual property rights and know-how of Phoenix Bio Pharm related to certain medical cannabinoid products and delivery systems for the treatment and management of illnesses. Products falling under the license will include the following medicinal cannabis products: transdermal patches, orally administered extracts, concentrated extracts for vaporizers and inhalers, sublingual and buccal dispensing products and extraction technology, suppository delivery systems, salves, creams, gels, lotions, and liquid extracts, and any products or active ingredients sourced through Phoenix Bio Pharm affiliates or third party suppliers or licensors.
 
The Company will also have the right to sublicense the rights acquired pursuant to the license agreement and to use and develop copyrighted materials of Phoenix Bio Pharm for marketing and distribution purposes. In consideration of the acquired license, the Company issued 26,000,000 shares of common stock to Phoenix Bio Pharm, valued at $13,000,000 based on a discounted cash flow model and the fair value of the assets acquired in the license agreement.
 
On January 5, 2015, the Company entered into an additional license agreement with Phoenix Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation to expand the territories covered under its original license agreement dated March 14, 2014. Under the terms of the additional license agreement, the Company acquired the marketing rights to distribute products developed by Phoenix Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation in Australia and New Zealand for ten years. In exchange for the license, the Company issued 250,000,000 restricted common shares at $0.016 per common share, for an aggregate value of $4,000,000. 
 
On July 8, 2015, the Company agreed to enter into a new licensing agreement with Phoenix Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation. This new agreement shall replace the previous licensing agreements. The new licensing agreement shall be non-exclusive, CBD only licensing agreement with Phoenix Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation. This license agreement operates for a twenty (20) year period. Phoenix Bio Pharm has granted to the Company a license for the territory of North America, Australia and New Zealand to exploit all presently owned and after-acquired intellectual property rights and know-how of Phoenix Bio Pharm related to CBD based cannabinoid products and delivery systems for the treatment and management of illnesses. Products falling under the license will include the following CBD products: transdermal patches, orally administered extracts, concentrated extracts of vaporizers and inhalers, sublingual and buccal dispensing products and extraction technology, suppository delivery systems, salves, creams, gels, lotions, and liquid extracts, and any product or active ingredients sourced through Phoenix Bio Pharm or third party suppliers or licensors. The Company will also have the right to sublicense the rights acquired pursuant to the license agreement and to use and develop copyrighted materials of Phoenix Bio Pharm for marketing and distribution purposes.

In addition to the new licensing agreement, on July 8, 2015 the Company has entered into an exchange agreement with Phoenix Bio Pharm where all existing common shares held by Phoenix Bio Pharm (276,000,000) are exchanged for 2,000,000 Series B Preferred Shares, par value $0.0001. These preferred shares are entitled to 100 votes for each share held, and convertible into 100 common shares per preferred share at any time at the discretion of the holder.
 
Subsequently as the Company has failed to meet projected cash flows which underpin the valuation model of the License Agreement. The Company determined that the balance of License Agreement should be impaired. Accordingly a total of $14,014,189 was expensed as an impairment to the License Agreement and paid in capital was reduced by $2,282,132 at year ended February 28, 2015.

In connection with the convertible promissory note dated December 23, 2014, the Company subsequently issued warrants to purchase 20,000,000 common shares at an exercise price of $0.02 per common share to Kisha Spendthrift Trust, an affiliate of CannaVest Corp. These warrants were issued on January 6, 2015. In exchange for these warrants, the Company shall have access to the technical and management staff of CannaVest Corp. for the development of products to be manufactured from cannabidiol sourced from CannaVest Corp. 
 
On or about January 25, 2016, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 1 to the Convertible Promissory Note executed by and between the Company and CV Sciences, Inc (FKA Cannavest Corp. and referred to herein as “CVS”) dated December 23, 2014 (the “Note”), whereby the company and CVS agreed to terminate the Note upon the Company’s return of five containers of raw hemp oil to CVS. As of February 29, 2016 four of five containers had been returned to CVS due to quality issues with the product.
 
GoKush
 On May 13, 2014, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with South Pacific Resources, Inc., DBA GoKush.com LLC (“GoKush”) that is part of a not-for-profit California Cooperative Corporation that is dedicated to providing safe and legal access to medical marijuana for patients throughout California. Pursuant to the agreement, amongst other things, the Company issued GoKush 200,000 common shares of the Company. GoKush agreed to become the online ordering platform for the ordering and re-stock of the Company’s products in California. As of October 2014, Medi-Strips have been available for sale through the GoKush online ordering system.
 
As consideration of the distribution agreement, the Company issued GoKush 200,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock valued at $172,000. The Company was to amortize the cost of the Distribution Agreement over the ten year life beginning October 2014 when on-line sales of product commenced.
 
However the Company was not paid for any sales and as such the Company determined that there is no value in the distribution agreement. Accordingly an impairment of $141,800 of the distribution agreement was made and paid-in capital was reduced by $13,000 for the year ended February 28, 2015.

As of February 2016, 28 states plus Washington DC have passed laws for medicinal cannabis use, ranging from cannabidiol (CBD) only to broad spectrum cannabinoid use. In 2012, Colorado and Washington legalized marijuana for recreational use. In 2014, Oregon and Alaska legalized medical marijuana for recreational use.
 
The Company is forming strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and medical device sales professionals to capitalize on this growing new market.
 
As published by the Huffington Post in November 2013, the medical marijuana market is larger than the smartphone market. The Company believes that the medical marijuana is among one of the fastest-growing markets in the United States. The Company plans to secure a large share of the market place by providing superior products. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/04/marijuana-market_n_4209874.html
 
Industry Analysis
The health, wellness and cannabinoid industries in the United States have been growing due to a substantial growth in the numbers of states approving the use of medical and adult-use marijuana and cannabinoid products. Additionally, in recent years, several internationally recognized medical journals and medical professionals including CNN’s chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, have published results relating to the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of cancer, childhood seizures, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis and pain management. This swell of interest in alternative health and wellness related to the use of cannabinoids is resulting in the establishment of new opportunities across many industries. Individual states have passed legislation for the regulation of medical and recreational use, but the lack of federal mandates has created some uncertainty in the industry.
Competitive Analysis
The health, wellness and cannabinoid industries, specifically in states that have passed medicinal marijuana laws, are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we expect that the competition will intensify in the future. Barriers to entry are minimal. We believe while we currently may have advantages in this market, the growth of this market is able to allow us to take a market share if we can raise sufficient funds to commence full-scale operations. We will compete on the basis of quality and value, whilst leveraging established brands and operators, and through customer preference. Our competitors may be well established, substantially larger and have substantially greater market recognition, greater resources and broader capabilities than we have. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by the Company may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations

Revenue
The Company will receive revenue from the sales of its licensed products.
 
Government Regulations
Most countries are parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, which governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances, including cannabis extracts. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to the Company obtaining marketing approval our products in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit the products to be marketed, or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time.
 
The cannabis industry faces challenges as a result of federal laws which limit and regulate cannabis products and federal tax laws which make it difficult for us to claim deductions on our tax returns. The IRS has been enforcing IRC Sec. 280E, a law from the 1970s that bars tax deductions for business expenses incurred by drug dealers. This law prevents and deduction or credit for any amount paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business if said trade or business consists of trafficking in Schedule I or II controlled substances which is prohibited by federal law or the law of any State in which the trade or business is being conducted. This law was intended to stop drug dealers from claiming tax deductions, but the IRS has stated that it applies to medical marijuana companies as well. The tax court has upheld this interpretation. As a result of this, we may not be able to claim business deductions on our tax returns.
 
Our products contain controlled substances as defined in the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA. Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA classifies controlled substances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, no currently “accepted medical use” in the United States, lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the United States. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the United States may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule I and II drugs are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. In addition, dispensing of Schedule II drugs is further restricted. For example, they may not be refilled without a new prescription.
 
While cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance, products approved for medical use in the United States that contain cannabis or cannabis extracts if to be approved federally, must be placed in Schedules II—V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the “accepted medical use” requirement. If any proposed products developed receive FDA approval, the DEA will make a scheduling determination and place it in a schedule other than Schedule I in order for it to be prescribed to patients in the United States. Consequently, its manufacture, importation, exportation, domestic distribution, storage, sale and legitimate use will be subject to a significant degree of regulation by the DEA. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in the loss of our DEA registration, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. In addition, the scheduling process may take one or more years, thereby delaying the launch of any product in the United States. Furthermore, if the FDA, DEA, or any foreign regulatory authority determines that any product may have potential for abuse, it may require us to generate more clinical or other data than we currently anticipate to establish whether or to what extent the substance has an abuse potential, which could increase the cost and/or delay the launch of any proposed product. Our products are federally considered a Schedule 1 controlled substance. As a result, we only sell our products within states that have passed marijuana laws allowing for the sale of Schedule 1 products.

Facilities conducting research, manufacturing, distributing, importing or exporting, or dispensing controlled substances must be registered (licensed) to perform these activities and have the security, control, recordkeeping, reporting and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. All these facilities must renew their registrations annually, except dispensing facilities, which must renew every three years. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Obtaining the necessary registrations may result in delay of the importation, manufacturing or distribution of any products. Furthermore, failure to maintain compliance with the CSA, particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to restrict, suspend or revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings.
 
Individual states have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule any product candidates as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug based on federal action, other states schedule drugs through rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could have a material adverse effect on the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our partners must also obtain separate state registrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.
 
Because some of the proposed products contain cannabis extracts, which are Schedule I substances, to conduct clinical trials in the United States prior to approval, each of the research sites must submit a research protocol to the DEA and obtain and maintain a DEA researcher registration that will allow those sites to handle and dispense the products and to obtain the product from our importer. If the DEA delays or denies the grant of a research registration to one or more research sites, the clinical trial could be significantly delayed, and the clinical trial sites could be lost. The importer for the clinical trials must also obtain a Schedule I importer registration and an import permit for each import.
 
If a product is approved and classified as a Schedule II or III substance, an importer can import for commercial purposes if it obtains an importer registration and files an application for an import permit for each import. The DEA provides annual assessments/estimates to the International Narcotics Control Board that guides the DEA in the amounts of controlled substances that the DEA authorizes to be imported. The failure to identify an importer or obtain the necessary import authority, including specific quantities, could affect the availability of proposed products and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, an application for a Schedule II importer registration must be published in the Federal Register, and there is a waiting period for third party comments to be submitted.
 
If a product is approved and classified as a Schedule II controlled substance, federal law may prohibit the import of the substance for commercial purposes. If a product is listed as a Schedule II substance, the manufacturer will not be allowed to import the drug for commercial purposes unless the DEA determines that domestic supplies are inadequate or there is inadequate domestic competition among domestic manufacturers for the substance as defined by the DEA. Moreover, Schedule I controlled substances have never been registered with the DEA for importation commercial purposes, only for scientific and research needs. Therefore, if neither a product could be imported, a product would have to be wholly manufactured in the United States, and we would need to secure a manufacturer that would be required to obtain and maintain a separate DEA registration for that activity If, because of a Schedule II classification or voluntarily, a project developer were to conduct manufacturing or repackaging/relabeling in the United States, they would be subject to the DEA’s annual manufacturing and procurement quota requirements. Additionally, regardless of the scheduling of any product, cannabis comprising the active ingredient in the final dosage form are currently Schedule I controlled substances and would be subject to such quotas as these substances could remain listed on Schedule I. The annual quota allocated to us or our contract manufacturers for the active ingredient in any product may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Consequently, any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers’, procurement and/or production quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operations.

If a product is scheduled as Schedule II or III, we would also need to identify wholesale distributors with the appropriate DEA registrations and authority to distribute the product to pharmacies and other health care providers. We would need to identify distributors to distribute the product to pharmacies; these distributors would need to obtain Schedule II or III distribution registrations. The failure to obtain, or delay in obtaining, or the loss any of those registrations could result in increased costs to us. If a product is a Schedule II drug, pharmacies would have to maintain enhanced security with alarms and monitoring systems and they must adhere to recordkeeping and inventory requirements. This, coupled with the fact that a product must be refrigerated, may discourage some pharmacies from carrying the product. Furthermore, state and federal enforcement actions, regulatory requirements, and legislation intended to reduce prescription drug abuse, such as the requirement that physicians consult a state prescription drug monitoring program may make physicians less willing to prescribe, and pharmacies to dispense, Schedule II products.
