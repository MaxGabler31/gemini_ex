ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Overview
 
SAExploration Holdings, Inc. (“we”, “our” or “us”) is a publicly held Delaware corporation formed in 2011.  We were formed with the merger of Trio Merger Corp and SAExploration Holdings, Inc. (the “Former SAE”).  Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “SAEX.”  Our business activities are primarily conducted through wholly–owned subsidiaries and branch offices in North America, South America, Asia Pacific and West Africa.
 
We are a full–service global provider of seismic data acquisition, logistical support, processing and integrated reservoir geosciences services to our customers in the oil and natural gas industry. In addition to the acquisition of 2D, 3D, time–lapse 4D and multi–component seismic data on land, in transition zones between land and water, and offshore in depths reaching 3,000 meters, we offer a full–suite of logistical support and data processing and interpretation services utilizing our proprietary, patent–protected software. We operate crews around the world that are supported by over 135,000 owned land and marine channels of seismic data acquisition equipment and other leased equipment as needed to complete particular projects. Seismic data is used by our customers, including major integrated oil companies, national oil companies and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies, to identify and analyze drilling prospects and maximize successful drilling. The results of the seismic surveys we conduct belong to our customers and are proprietary in nature; we do not acquire data for our own account or for future sale or maintain multi–client data libraries.
 
We specialize in the acquisition of seismic data in logistically complex and challenging environments and delicate ecosystems, including jungle, mountain, arctic and subaquatic terrains. We have extensive experience in deploying personnel and equipment in remote locations, while maintaining a strong quality, health, safety and environmental (“QHSE”) track record and building positive community relations in the locations where we operate. We employ highly specialized crews made up of personnel with the training and skills required to prepare for and execute each project and, over time, train and employ large numbers of people from the local communities where we conduct our surveys. Our personnel are equipped with the technology necessary to meet the specific needs of the particular project and to manage the challenges presented by sensitive environments.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $184.9 million of backlog under contract, in addition to approximately $570.7 million of bids outstanding.  Our backlog estimates represent those projects for which a customer has executed a contract or signed a binding letter of award.  Our backlog can vary significantly from time to time, particularly if the backlog is made up of multi–year contracts with some of our more significant customers.  Because of potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers’ projects, and the possibility of early termination of customer contracts, we cannot predict with certainty when or if our backlog will be realized.  Material delays, payment defaults or cancellations on the underlying contracts could reduce the amount of backlog currently reported and, consequently, could inhibit the conversion of that backlog into revenues.   
 
Our principal headquarters are located at 1160 Dairy Ashford Rd., Suite 160, Houston, Texas, 77079.  Our telephone number is (281) 258–4400, and our web address is www.saexploration.com.  We do not intend for information contained in our website to be a part of this report.
 
Recent Developments
 
In February 2019, we borrowed an additional $9.7 million under our credit facility and now have $22.0 million outstanding.  We also extended the maturity date of our senior loan facility to January 4, 2021.
 
As of March 19, 2019, we have issued 0.7 million shares of common stock through the exercise of our Series C warrants, Series D warrants and Series E warrants thus far in 2019.

Industry Overview
 
Seismic technology is the primary tool used to locate oil and natural gas reserves, and it facilitates the development of complex reservoirs.  Seismic data is used to pinpoint and determine the locations of subsurface features favorable for the accumulation of hydrocarbons, as well as define the make–up of the sedimentary rock layers and their corresponding fluids.  Seismic data is acquired by introducing acoustic energy into the earth and water through controlled energy sources.  Seismic energy sources can consist of truck–mounted vibration equipment in accessible terrain, explosives such as dynamite in more difficult terrain, or vessel–mounted air guns in shallow water and certain marsh environments.  The sound waves created by explosives or vibration equipment are reflected back to the surface and collected by seismic sensors referred to as “geophones” or “hydrophones,” which measure ground and water displacement.  One or more strategically positioned seismic sensors are connected to a recording channel which transmits the data to a central recording location.  A typical project involves the use of thousands, and sometimes tens of thousands, of channels recording simultaneously over the survey area.  In general, the higher the number of recording channels employed in a given survey, the richer the data set that is produced.
 
A seismic survey is acquired with a surface geometry grid of seismic energy sources and receivers extending over very large areas.  The size of this grid varies with and depends on the size, depth and geophysical characteristics of the target to be imaged.  The lines must be accurately positioned, so the location of each source and receiver point is obtained using either GPS, inertial, or conventional optical survey methods depending upon the vegetation and environment in the prospect area.  Seismic receivers are deployed on the surface of the area being surveyed at regular intervals and patterns to measure, digitize and transmit reflected seismic energy to a set of specialized recording instruments.  The transportation of cables, geophones and field recording equipment can be by truck, vessel or helicopter depending upon the terrain and environment within the area to be imaged.
 
Two–dimensional, or 2D, seismic data is recorded using single lines of receivers crossing the earth’s surface, and, once processed, results in only a profile image of the earth, and the data is generally used only to identify gross structural features.  Prior to 1980, all seismic data acquired was 2D, and 2D surveys are still widely employed in locations previously unexplored by exploration and production (“E&P”) companies to provide preliminary data for broad–scale exploration evaluation.  Three–dimensional, or 3D, seismic data surveys have proven more effective in providing detailed views of subsurface structures.
 
The increased use of 3D seismic data by the oil and natural gas industry in the 1980s helped drive significant increases in drilling success rates as better data quality allowed operators to optimize well locations and results.  Today, the vast majority of seismic data acquired in North America is 3D, of which high density 3D is a growing component.
 
More recently, the seismic industry has seen the development of four–dimensional, or 4D, imaging technology, also known as time–lapse seismic.  4D seismic data incorporates numerous 3D seismic surveys over the same reservoir at specified intervals of time and can help determine changes in flow, pressure and saturation.  As hydrocarbons are depleted from a field, the pressure and composition of the fluids may change.  By scanning a reservoir over a given period of time, the flow of the hydrocarbons within can be traced and better understood.  In addition, 4D seismic data can help geologists understand how a reservoir reacts to gas injection or water flooding and can help locate untapped pockets of oil or natural gas within the reservoir.
 
Once seismic data is acquired, complex mathematical algorithms are used to transform the data into 2D profiles, 3D volumes of the earth’s subsurface or 4D time–lapse seismic data.  These images are then interpreted by geophysicists and geologists for use by oil and natural gas companies in evaluating prospective areas, designing drilling programs, selecting drilling sites and managing producing reservoirs.
 
Our Business
 
Seismic Data Acquisition Services
 
We provide a full range of seismic data acquisition services, including in–field data processing, and related logistics services. We currently provide our services on a proprietary basis to our customers and the seismic data acquired is owned by our customers once acquired.  Our seismic data acquisition and logistics services include the following:
 
4


Program Design, Planning and Permitting.  A seismic survey is initiated at the time the customer requests a proposal to acquire seismic data on its behalf.  We employ an experienced design team, including geophysicists with extensive experience in 2D, 3D, time–lapse 4D, and multi–component survey design, to recommend acquisition parameters and technologies to best meet the customer’s exploration objectives.  Our design team analyzes the request and works with the customer to put an operational, personnel and capital resource plan in place to execute the project.
 
Once a seismic program is designed, we assist the customer in obtaining the necessary permits from governmental authorities and access rights of way from surface and mineral estate owners or lessees where the survey is to be conducted.  It is usually our permitting crew that is first to engage with the local residents and authorities.  We believe our knowledge of the local environment, cultural norms and excellent QHSE track record enable us to engender trust and goodwill with the local communities, which our customers are able to leverage over the longer exploration cycle in the area.
 
Camp Services.  We have developed efficient processes for assembling, operating and disassembling field camps in challenging and remote project locations.  We operate our camps to ensure the safety, comfort and productivity of the team working on each project and to minimize our environmental impact through the use of wastewater treatment, trash management, water purification, generators with full noise isolation and recycling areas.
 
In areas like South America and the Asia Pacific, logistical support needs to be in place to establish supply lines for remote jungle camps.  To insure the quality of services delivered to these remote camps, we own ten supply and personnel river vessels to gain access to remote jungle areas.  We also have five jungle camps and a series of 40 fly camps that act as advance camps from the main project camp.  Each of these jungle base camps contains a full service medical facility complete with doctors and nurses in the remote chance any potential injuries need to be stabilized for medical transport.  The camps are equipped with full meal kitchens held to high standards of cleanliness, sleeping and recreational quarters, power supply, communications links, air support, water purification systems, black water purification systems, offices, repair garages, fuel storage and many more support services.
 
Survey and Drilling.  In a typical seismic recording program, the first two stages of the program are survey and drilling.  Once the permitting is completed, our survey crews enter the project areas and begin establishing the source and receiver placements in accordance with the survey design agreed to by the customer.  The survey crew lays out the line locations to be recorded and, if explosives are being used, identifies the sites for shot–hole placement.  The drilling crew creates the holes for the explosive charges that produce the necessary acoustical impulse.
 
The surveying and drilling crews are usually employed by us but may be third party contractors depending on the nature of the project and its location.  Generally, the choice of whether to subcontract out services depends on the expertise available in a certain region and whether that expertise is more efficiently obtained through subcontractors or by using our own labor force.  For the most part, the surveying and drilling crews in North America are typically provided by third party contractors but are supervised by our personnel.  services are subcontracted within Alaska and Canada and our personnel are used in other regions where we operate.  In South America and the Asia Pacific, we perform our own surveying and drilling, which is supported by up to 200 drilling units, including people–portable, low impact self–propelled walk behind, track–driven and heli–portable deployed drilling rigs.  Our senior drilling staff has a combined work experience of over 50 years in some of the most challenging environments in the world.  On most programs there are multiple survey and drilling crews that work at a coordinated pace to remain ahead of the data recording crews. When subcontractors are used, we manage them and require that they comply with our work policies and QHSE objectives.
 
Recording.  We use equipment capable of collecting 2D, 3D, time–lapse 4D and multi–component seismic data.  We utilize vibrator energy sources or explosives depending on the nature of the program and measure the reflected signals with strategically placed sensors.  For land applications, geophones are buried, or partially buried, to ensure good coupling with the surface and to reduce wind noise.  Burying geophones in the ground is a manual process and may involve anywhere from a few to more than 100 people depending on the size of the seismic crew and the terrain involved.  Cables that connect the geophones to cabled recording systems may also be deployed manually or, in some cases, automatically from a vehicle depending on the terrain. The acoustic source for land seismic data acquisition is typically a fleet of large hydraulic vibrator trucks but may also be explosives detonated in holes drilled for such purposes.
 
In marine surveys, air guns, which release high–pressure compressed air into the water column, are used as the acoustic energy source.  For ocean bottom cable operations, an assembly of vertically oriented geophones and hydrophones connected by electrical wires typically is deployed on the sea floor to record and relay data to a seismic recording vessel.  Increasingly, ocean bottom nodes positioned by remote operated vehicles are used in areas of obstructions (such as production platforms) or shallow water inaccessible to ships towing seismic streamers (such as submerged cables).
 5



In the transition zone area where land and water come together, elements of both land data acquisition and offshore data acquisition are employed.  Transition zone seismic data acquisition is similar to ocean bottom cable applications in that both hydrophones and geophones are lowered to the ocean floor.  However, due to the shallow water depths, only small vessels and manual labor can be used to deploy and retrieve the cables.  Additionally, the source vessels and acoustic source arrays must be configured to run in shallow water.  In transition zone areas consisting of swamps and marshes, explosives must be used as an acoustic source in addition to air guns.
 
Reclamation.  We have experienced teams responsible for reclamation of the areas where work has been performed so as to minimize the environmental footprint from the seismic program.  These programs can include reforestation or other activities to restore the natural landscape at our worksites.
In–field Data Processing. Our knowledgeable and experienced team provides our customers with superior quality in–field data processing.  We believe that our strict quality control processes meet or surpass industry–established standards, including identifying and analyzing ambient noise, evaluating field parameters and employing obstacle–recovery strategies.  Using the latest technology, our technical and field teams electronically manage customer data from the field to the processing office, minimizing time between field production and processing.  All of the steps employed in our in–field data processing sequence are tailored to the particular customer project and objectives.
 
We have available over 135,000 owned land and marine seismic recording channels with the ability to access additional equipment, as needed, through rental or long–term leasing sources.  All our systems record equivalent seismic information but vary in the manner by which seismic data is transferred to the central recording unit, as well as their operational flexibility and channel count expandability.  
 
Historically, we have made significant capital investments to increase the recording capacity of our crews by increasing channel count and the number of energy source units we operate.  This increase in channel count demand is driven by customer needs and is necessary in order to produce higher resolution images, increase crew efficiencies and undertake larger scale projects.  In response to project–based channel requirements, we routinely deploy a variable number of channels with a variable number of crews in an effort to maximize asset utilization and meet customer needs.  When recording equipment is at or near full utilization, we utilize rental equipment from strategic suppliers to augment our existing inventories.  We believe we will realize the benefit of increased channel counts and flexibility of deployment through increased crew efficiencies, higher revenues and increased margins.
 
Historically, we have also dedicated a significant portion of our capital investment to purchasing and leasing wireless recording systems rather than the traditional wired systems.  We utilize this equipment as primarily stand–alone recording systems, but on occasion it is used in conjunction with cable–based systems.  The wireless recording systems allow us to gain further efficiencies in data recording and provide greater flexibility in the complex environments in which we operate.  In addition, we have realized increased crew efficiencies and lessened the environmental impact of our seismic programs due to the wireless recording systems because they require the presence of fewer personnel and less equipment in the field.  We believe we will experience continued demand for wireless recording systems in the future.
 
We also utilize multi–component recording equipment on certain projects to further enhance the quality of data acquired and help our customers enhance their development of producing reservoirs.  Multi–component recording involves the collection of different seismic waves, including shear waves, which aids in reservoir analysis such as fracture orientation and intensity in shales and allows for more descriptive rock properties.
 
Seismic Data Processing and Integrated Reservoir Geosciences Services
 
We provide a full suite of onshore and offshore proprietary seismic data processing and integrated reservoir geosciences solutions to complement our seismic data acquisition services.  Seismic data are processed to produce an accurate image of the earth’s subsurface using proprietary computer software and internally developed technologies.  Advanced signal processing of 2D, 3D, time–lapse 4D and multi–component seismic data acquired by us, other industry contractors, as well as reprocessing of previously acquired legacy data, provides our clients with detailed subsurface information essential to reducing risk in their E&P activities.  
 
6


We also offer our clients integrated reservoir services where our experts can combine the power of seismic, geologic, well and petrophysical information to provide detailed information of rock lithologies and fluid content at the reservoir level.  This integration of all sources of subsurface information has become particularly critical with the emergence of shale plays in North America and internationally since, in these plays, gross structural information is much less important than understanding physical rock properties such as fracture characterization and stress relationships at the reservoir formation level.

In addition to providing clients with effective solutions customized to their processing needs, we actively market our seismic data processing and integrated reservoir geosciences services in conjunction with our seismic data acquisition services to enhance total value provided to our customers.
 
Markets and Trends
 
North America
 
While the last several years have seen a decline in demand, the North American market has historically been a stable and sustainable market for 3D seismic data acquisition. The historic stability of this market was one of the reasons we acquired the assets of Geokinetics, Inc. (“GEOK”) in July 2018.  Use of 3D technology is the norm in the United States and Canada as international oil companies seek to maximize the efficiency of their reservoirs and reduce exploration risk.
 
Our operations in the North American market are consistent with our strategy to help increase our equipment utilization rates, while concurrently increasing margins, by balancing growth in North and South America, which have complementary operating seasons.  While this model continues to be a viable operating model, the industry downturn has created significant pressure on competitive cost structures and pricing, particularly during the early 2018 winter season.  However, we are beginning to see signs that would suggest this trend may be shifting towards an increase in overall regional activity assuming there is a longer period of consistency in the commodity price environment.
 
South America
 
The economies in South American countries continue to expand and develop, demanding significantly more energy to fuel their growth. As the political environments stabilize, oil companies are increasing operations in the market and are seeking experienced seismic service providers with complex environment know–how, strong QHSE records and excellent relations with local communities to satisfy their exploration needs.
 
We have maintained operations in South America since 2006 while further growing our presence in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.  However, the global oil and natural gas industry downturn significantly impacted exploration activity in South America particularly during 2018 and 2017.  While some improvements in the level of customer interest can be seen by an increase in inquiries and subsequent tenders, no assurance can be given that this will result in increased activity or that future decreases in activity will not occur again.
 
Asia Pacific
 
Exploration activities in Asia Pacific have declined recently with lower commodity prices but there is a steady demand for energy in the region. We expect the Asia Pacific market to continue to be a predominantly marine–based market in the current commodity price environment.  This trend is expected to continue as long as customers remain hesitant to commit capital to large onshore projects that are more exploration driven.
West Africa
 
Historically, West Africa has presented numerous offshore marine opportunities.  More recently, offshore marine seismic activity has been increasing in certain West African countries.  These projects are more focused on production–enhancement initiatives than new exploration.  Despite the current macro–economic instability related to the oil and natural gas industry downturn, we expect overall offshore marine seismic activity to continue to improve in the near to medium–term future.

Seasonal Variation in Business
 
Seismic data acquisition services are performed outdoors and, consequently, are subject to weather and seasonality. In Alaska and Canada, the primary season for seismic data acquisition is during the winter since much of the terrain for seismic data acquisition cannot be accessed until the ground has frozen. The weather conditions during this time of year can affect the timing and efficiency of operations. In addition, this prime season can be shortened by warmer weather conditions.
 
In South America and the Asia Pacific, our operations are affected by the periods of heavy rain in the areas where seismic operations are conducted. Specifically, the jungle areas in South America are affected by heavy rain during certain parts of the year so we must either avoid taking projects during these time periods or limit the weather risk in a particular customer contract. Many of the heavy rain periods in South America, though, are during the high season for Alaska and Canada, and there are opportunities to maximize the utilization of equipment and personnel by moving them between these regions to take advantage of the different high seasons.
 
In all areas of operation, the weather is an uncontrollable factor that affects our operations at various times of the year. We try to minimize these risks during the bidding process by utilizing the expertise of our personnel as to the weather in a particular area and through the negotiation of downtime clauses in our contracts with our customers. Due to the unpredictability of weather conditions, there may be times when adverse conditions substantially affect our operations and the financial results of a particular project may be impacted.
 
Marketing
 
Our services are marketed from our various offices around the world. We have a corporate business development and marketing staff and also have local managers who interact with customers in each country of operations. Through these customer interactions, we are able to remain updated on a customer’s upcoming projects in the area and to work with the customer on projects in other countries.
 
Contracts are obtained either by direct negotiation with a prospective customer or through competitive bidding in response to invitations to bid. Most of our revenue historically has been generated through repeat customer sales and new sales to customers referred by existing and past customers. In addition, a significant portion of our engagements results from competitive bidding. Contracts are awarded primarily on the basis of price, experience, availability, technological expertise and reputation for dependability and safety. With the involvement and review of senior management, bids are prepared by knowledgeable regional operations managers who understand their respective markets, customers and operating conditions and who communicate directly with existing and target customers during the bid preparation process.
 
We also work closely with customers on a direct award basis to plan particular seismic data acquisition projects. Due to the complexity of the areas where we do business, these projects can take a number of months in planning and consulting with the customer on exploration goals and parameters of the projects to fit within a particular budget. By working closely with the customer, we are able to acquire seismic data for a project efficiently and within the customer’s required timeframe.
 
Contracts
 
We conduct our services under master service agreements with our customers that set forth certain obligations of our customers and us. A supplemental agreement setting forth the terms of a specific project, which may be canceled by either party on short notice, is entered into for every project. The supplemental agreements are either “turnkey” agreements that provide for a fixed fee to be paid to us for each unit of data acquired or processed, or “term” agreements that provide for a fixed hourly, daily or monthly fee during the term of the project. Turnkey agreements generally mean more profit potential, but involve more risks due to potential crew downtimes or operational delays. Under term agreements, we are ensured a more consistent revenue stream with improved protection from crew downtime or operational delays, but with a decreased profit potential.
 
Our contracts for proprietary seismic data acquisition services reflect a high proportion of turnkey contracts, which is preferred by our customers because it shifts much of the business interruption risk onto us; however, it provides us with the greatest opportunity to maximize the advantage we have from being a full–service provider and the operational efficiencies created by our vertical integration. We attempt to negotiate on a project–by–project basis some level of weather downtime protection within the turnkey agreements and increasingly use hybrid contracts where we may share with our customers a certain degree of the risks for certain business interruptions, such as weather, community relations and permitting delays, that are outside of our control.

Principal Customers
 
Our customers include both national and international oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas companies.  Our revenues are derived from a concentrated customer base; however, we are not substantially dependent on any one customer.  Based on the nature of our contracts and customer projects, our significant customers can and typically do change from year to year and the largest customers in any one year may not be indicative of the largest customers in the future.   
 
In 2018, we had four customers, TGS–NOPEC Geophysical Company, ConocoPhillips Alaska, Inc., Hocol Petroleum Limited and Parex Resources (Colombia) Ltd., that individually exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenue from services and represented approximately 55% of consolidated revenue from services for the year.  In 2017, we had three customers, Conoco Phillips Alaska, Inc., Star Deep Water Petroleum Limited and Hocol Petroleum Limited, that individually exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenue from services and represented approximately 75% of consolidated revenue from services for the year.  
 
Competition
 
The acquisition and processing of seismic data for the oil and natural gas industry is a highly competitive business. Factors such as price, experience, asset availability and capacity, technological expertise and reputation for dependability and safety of a crew significantly affect a potential customer’s decision to award a contract to us or one of our competitors.  In addition, the recent excess supply and downturn in commodity prices has decreased demand for seismic services, further intensifying the competitive landscape and causing further pressure on pricing and margins.
 
Our competitors include much larger companies with greater financial resources, more available equipment and more crews, as well as companies of comparable and smaller sizes.  Our primary competitors are Compagnie Générale de Géophysique (CGG), BGP, Inc. and Dawson Geophysical Company.  In addition to those companies, we also compete for projects from time to time with smaller seismic companies that operate in local markets with only one or two crews.  As the barriers to entry in the seismic industry are not prohibitive, it is not difficult for seismic companies outside of the U.S. to enter the domestic market and compete with us.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on certain proprietary information, proprietary software, trade secrets and confidentiality and licensing agreements to conduct our operations.  We continually strive to improve our operating techniques and technologies, through internal development activities and working with vendors to develop new processes and technologies to maintain pace with industry innovation. Through this process, we have developed certain proprietary processes and methods of doing business, particularly with respect to logistics. Although those processes and methods may not be patentable, we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our key managers and customers.
Government and Environmental Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to various international, federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations. Those laws and regulations govern various aspects of operations, including the discharge of explosive materials into the environment, requiring the removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and access to private and governmental land to conduct seismic surveys. We believe we have conducted our operations in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing our activities.
 
The costs of acquiring permits and remaining in compliance with environmental laws and regulations, title research, environmental studies and surveys are generally borne by our customers. Although our direct costs of complying with applicable laws and regulations have historically not been material, the changing nature of such laws and regulations makes it impossible to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on future operations. Additional U.S. or foreign government laws or regulations would likely increase the compliance and insurance costs associated with our customers’ operations. Significant increases in compliance expenses for customers could have a material adverse effect on customers’ operating results and cash flows, which could also negatively impact the demand for our services.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 803 employees, 563 of whom were located in the United States. From time to time and on an as–needed basis, we supplement our regular workforce with individuals that we hire temporarily or as independent contractors in order to meet certain business needs. Our U.S. employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
