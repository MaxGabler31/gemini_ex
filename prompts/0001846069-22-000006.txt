Item 1. Business 
Overview
At Nextdoor, our purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on. Nextdoor is the neighborhood network that connects neighborhood stakeholders, including neighbors, businesses, and public services, online and in real life to build stronger, more vibrant, and resilient neighborhoods. As of December 31, 2021, Nextdoor was in more than 285,000 neighborhoods around the world and in nearly 1 in 3 households in the United States, and during the fourth quarter of 2021, we reached 69 million global Verified Neighbors1. Neighbors and organizations, which include small and mid-sized businesses, large brands, public agencies, and nonprofits, around the world turn to Nextdoor to receive trusted information, give and get help, and build real-world connections with neighborhood stakeholders.
Nextdoor began in the United States, and as of December 31, 2021, our platform was available in 11 countries. Beyond the United States, Nextdoor supports neighborhoods in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. In the United Kingdom, as of December 31, 2021, Nextdoor was in 1 in 5 households, and 1 in 4 households in London. We intend to expand our neighbor footprint globally and to increasingly become a weekly use case for neighbors. 
Value for Neighbors and Organizations
Value for Neighbors
Neighbors come to Nextdoor to connect to the neighborhoods that matter to them so they can belong. We leverage technology to enable online and real-world connections between neighbors and organizations — both of which are a valuable part of the neighborhood ecosystem. Nextdoor ensures neighbors are connected to real people by requiring neighbors to use their real name, which fosters a trusted environment so they can meet and learn more about those nearby. Further, since the experience is based on geographical location, Nextdoor uniquely provides a way to bring online connections into the real world. 
Value for Organizations
Nextdoor connects neighbors with each other and everything nearby, including organizations. Organizations are essential for building strong, vibrant neighborhoods and are a trusted and core member of the community. Businesses of all sizes and types come to Nextdoor to reach their customers in meaningful ways and to encourage action through hyperlocal targeting and personalization of advertising at scale. Public agencies come to Nextdoor to deliver critical information to neighbors with hyperlocal distribution. Public agencies also leverage Nextdoor to find out what is important to their constituents and communicate with them directly. This includes keeping neighbors apprised about everything from local events such as webinars and street fairs, to timely safety updates and urgent alerts and tips to stay safe and protected during times of crisis such as power outages, storms, or wildfires.
Our Platform
Nextdoor’s product strategy fulfills our purpose by enabling neighbors and organizations to build an “Active Valued Community” — an engaged community of neighbors, businesses, and public services that you can trust and depend on to exchange valuable information, goods, and services. The Nextdoor platform offers distinct functionalities and experiences for neighbors and organizations alike. 
How neighbors discover what's happening nearby 
•Newsfeed: The Newsfeed is where neighbors find constantly updated posts, discussions, photos, and links from other neighbors and organizations. Neighbors can respond by commenting or adding a reaction (e.g., like, thank, and wow), and can set their feed preferences (e.g., rank by top posts, recent activity, recent posts, or popular everywhere). 
1 Verified Neighbors are individuals who have joined Nextdoor and have had their address confirmed by us. 
•Notifications: In-app and Email Notifications inform neighbors about news, items, and activities they are interested in. Notifications include everything from trending posts to direct messages about items for sale to alerts by local public agencies. Notifications keep neighbors updated and drive increased engagement on Nextdoor.
•Search: Search gives neighbors the ability to find specific content and organizations (including large brands, small businesses, public agencies, and nonprofits) related to their neighborhood. Nextdoor’s search combines an understanding of search terms with filtering capabilities to get neighbors the results they are looking for.
How neighbors connect with organizations and find local resources 
•Businesses: Neighbors use Nextdoor to discover spots most-loved by locals, leave recommendations, find exclusive deals and promotions, and interact with businesses. As of December 31, 2021, neighbors had left more than 55 million business recommendations on Nextdoor.
•For Sale & Free: For Sale & Free is our truly local marketplace where neighbors buy, sell, or give away items, and even offer services such as babysitting and dog walking. 
•Public Services: On Nextdoor, neighbors can receive critical, real time information from trusted officials. Public agencies, including government entities and service providers, turn to Nextdoor directly, quickly, and easily reach neighbors in their community with hyperlocal information and alerts.
How neighbors connect with other neighbors 
•Posts, Comments, and Reactions: Through posts, comments, and reactions neighbors can reach out to the neighborhood to get and give information that is locally relevant, trusted, and in real time. Whether it is for a local plumber or a family friendly pizza place, neighbors know best.
•Connections: Connections are a new way to find and keep up with the neighbors you know and care about. When neighbors connect with each other, they will see each other’s posts, comments, and reactions highlighted in their feeds and have the ability to @mention them in posts and comments. The Neighbors You May Know feature recommends neighbors to connect with based on proximity, Connections in common, on-platform interactions, and personal contacts. 
•Groups: Neighbors create Groups to connect with those nearby with a common interest. We see an incremental lift in engagement after a neighbor engages with a Group.
•Messaging: Neighbors can contact other neighbors and organizations through direct messaging (e.g., neighbors messaging businesses, coordinating a time to pick up a desk, to borrow a printer, or get more information about a tutor).
Our Advertising Solutions
Advertisers of all sizes come to Nextdoor to reach their customers in meaningful ways, including through our proprietary self-serve Neighborhood Ad Center (“NAC”), which we continued to deploy in 2021 and will expand during 2022. Large brands use our platform to reach, engage, and convert neighbors by delivering hyperlocal and personalized advertising at scale. Small businesses rely on Nextdoor to reach customers with information that encourages local action. From building awareness to driving sales, we offer advertisers of all sizes distinct and differentiated products in a unique local context that allow them to reach the right neighbor, at the right time, with the right message. The value of Nextdoor’s audience to advertisers is driven by providing: 
•A high utility platform: Neighbors come to Nextdoor for a real-time solution nearby and to get things done. From finding an emergency plumber, to checking which Internet service provider works best locally, to finding the best spot for dinner. This creates a highly performant environment for advertisers who come to Nextdoor to create meaningful connections with a uniquely engaged local audience. 
•Access to untapped audiences: According to fourth quarter 2021 data from GWI, 76% of neighbors who visit Nextdoor at least once a month do not visit Snap, 57% do not visit Pinterest, and 17% do not visit Facebook. 
•Contextual relevance: Nextdoor content is highly relevant based on neighbors’ local boundaries, which provides a unique environment for brands to show up surrounded by relevant and welcome content.
•Neighborhood level data provides actionable insights: We have a unique ability to understand consumer behavior and trends from a national to a neighborhood level. Our data can provide valuable insights to advertisers to help them better serve their customers. 
•Hyperlocal personalization at scale: Advertisers reach neighbors both locally and with local customization at scale. We are able to dynamically update ad creatives to run nationally with local specifics, such as neighborhood names, store locations or business representative information, to create meaningful connections between our customers and neighbors.
Ad Placements
Advertisers can engage with their customers in multiple surfaces on our platform, including:
•Newsfeed: Advertisers can run ads in the Newsfeed to build awareness, to become part of the consideration set for a consumer’s purchase, and to create a direct response to an explicit call to action (e.g., visit our newly opened store). Ads are featured prominently where neighbors first look for what is happening on Nextdoor. Ads can also be customized (e.g., with neighborhood name and store location) to make them even more relevant.
•In-App Digest and Email Digest: Advertisers can also use ads in the In-App Digest and Email Digest to create awareness among neighbors who turn to their summary of top posts. Ads are highly visible, and neighborhood names and store locations can be customized by neighborhood.
•For Sale & Free: Advertisers can leverage ads in For Sale & Free to drive action such as shop now. Our local marketplace is where neighbors with high intent to buy will go. Ads are given a top spot in this contextually relevant space with the opportunity to customize by neighborhood.
•Search: Advertisers can bid on relevant categories that are aligned with their products and services. Neighbors use Nextdoor search to discover local businesses and get trusted recommendations from their neighbors. Offering solutions to our neighbors in this high intent experience gives advertisers a very efficient lower-funnel strategy to drive conversion.
Ad Formats
Our ad formats include, but are not limited to:
•Sponsored Posts: An advertisement that features some combination of text (static or dynamic), images (including static, animated, or video), audio, and URL links to a website where a customer can learn more about or buy goods or services. 
•Paid Search Listings: Advertisers can leverage paid search listings available in Nextdoor’s search ad marketplace to reach their desired audience with high-intent in a contextually relevant environment.
•Neighborhood Sponsorships: Advertisers leverage Neighborhood Sponsorships to drive awareness, build a positive reputation, and keep their business top of mind. With these sponsorships they create and distribute automated ad placements that regularly post to the Newsfeed in targeted ZIP codes.
•Local Deals: Advertisers offering goods and services use Local Deals to target specific neighborhoods and drive sales. Designing specific timely discounts and promotions for specific neighborhoods engages and motivates their best customers, those nearby.
Ad Auction
Ads on the Nextdoor platform compete via an auction-based system. Our ad auction allows us to serve ads to neighbors when and where it matters most, while optimizing business outcomes for advertisers. Our auction system selects the best ad for each available ad impression, based on the likelihood of a desired action occurring and how much that action is worth to advertisers. The likelihood of the action occurring depends on a variety of factors, such as ad relevance and creative quality. 
Measurement 
Delivering and demonstrating value for our advertisers is a key objective for Nextdoor. We offer a variety of measurement solutions that are mapped to advertisers’ goals and objectives, and validate Nextdoor’s performance. 
A Kind Platform
Nextdoor is a leading innovator in creating a kind platform that facilitates healthy neighborhood connections and conversations. We set clear guidelines and use a combination of people and technology to encourage the behaviors that support our purpose of cultivating a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.
From day one, we’ve ensured that Nextdoor neighborhoods are made up of real people, nearby. We require all new neighbors to accept our Neighbor Pledge upon joining, in order to introduce our community guidelines and provide personal accountability for interactions on the platform. If these guidelines are violated, neighbors are able to report the inappropriate behavior or the person engaging in the said behavior. 
We rely on a combination of technology and human review to effectively moderate the platform. We’ve always believed it’s important to incorporate local context into moderation decisions, which is why we’ve built our community volunteer programs to empower thoughtful neighborhood moderation. Review of potentially harmful content (e.g., misinformation, discrimination) and inappropriate neighbor behavior is always handled by Nextdoor staff to ensure consistency. 
Volunteers on our Neighborhood Teams help make Nextdoor a welcoming platform for all neighbors. Volunteer moderators are active neighbors who have access to specialized tools, resources and training — including an online course designed to help recognize and address bias in online discourse — that they can utilize to promote compliance with our community guidelines. Additionally, our Welcome Team volunteers are alerted when a new neighbor joins, so they can reach out with a message of connection and belonging to establish rapport. Building community is at the core of Nextdoor. 
Technology
Our investments in technology are focused on the following areas: Core Product Development, Business Solutions, and Cloud Infrastructure.
•Core product development. Our product organization focuses on creating and improving products for all our neighbors in the countries in which we operate around the world. Our platform powers hundreds of thousands of neighborhood networks and all the entities that form these neighborhoods across neighbors, businesses, and public agencies. Using machine-learning and proprietary technology, we enable locally relevant conversations, keeping neighbors informed and connected while nurturing civil and kind discussions with solutions like the Good Neighbor Pledge and the Kindness Reminder.
•Business solutions. Our proprietary Nextdoor Ad Manager (“NAM”) continues to be an area of expansion and powers a number of our advertising solutions. NAM is designed to be the heart of our ad tech stack, and to meet and exceed the demands of all of our customers, ranging from large brands to small business owners. Built with flexibility and modularity at its core, NAM consists of shared targeting, auctioning, machine learning, and delivery engines. NAM uses first-party data captured from the billions of daily actions on Nextdoor and combines it with proprietary neighborhood mapping data from our platform to create differentiated and hyperlocal audience targeting solutions. NAM also underpins NAC, which enables 
advertisers to quickly create ads, reach their most valuable audiences and optimize their campaigns in real time. Expansion of advertiser adoption of NAC will continue in 2022. 
•Cloud infrastructure. We continually invest in the underlying technology platform that powers all of our products and services. From its inception, our infrastructure was built to be cloud-native, applying well-tested design patterns with distributed systems that are linearly scalable and highly flexible. We partner with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) as our preferred cloud services provider to support our growing platform needs. We enable our engineering resources to focus on improving the products for our neighbors on Nextdoor.
•Development principles. Execution velocity and autonomy are critical pillars of our engineering culture. We employ agile development processes and techniques combined with continuous integration (“CI”) and continuous deployment (“CD”) to empower our teams to rapidly improve our products and the platforms that power them. 
Leveraging data generated by usage of our products is a first principle in how we develop, test, and iterate to continually improve the user experience and inform our future product roadmap.
In addition, we build our products to be global-ready and mobile first, with the majority of our neighbors using our iOS and Android mobile apps to interact with our products.
Intellectual property
Our intellectual property and core technological innovations are integral components of our business. To establish and protect our intellectual property, proprietary rights and brand, we rely on a combination of federal, state, and common-law rights in the United States and the rights under the laws of other countries, patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain name, trade secrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure, and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights.
We own a trademark portfolio, including registered trademarks and applications in the United States and other countries, for the marks NEXTDOOR, , and . We have registered domain names that we use in or relate to our business, such as the <nextdoor.com> domain name and country code top level domain name equivalents. As of December 31, 2021, we had eight issued patents and three filed patent applications in the United States and certain other foreign countries. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Additionally, our current and future patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property or other proprietary rights may be contested, circumvented or found unenforceable or invalid. We may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient protection for or successfully enforce our intellectual property. We license content, technology, and other intellectual property from our partners, and rely on our license agreements with those partners to use the intellectual property. Third parties may assert claims related to intellectual property rights against our partners or us.

Human Capital
Our Culture and Core Values
Community is at the heart of Nextdoor and our growing community of employees is our lifeblood. Our employees have a wide range of experiences and perspectives, which fuel our purpose to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.
Our company core values are:
•Earn trust everyday; 
•Invest in community; 
•Customer obsessed; 
•Think big; 
•Experiment and learn quickly; and 
•Act like an owner.
We live these core values through our approach to our people practices, summarized below.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 602 full-time employees in the United States and in our international locations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland, France and Australia. 
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging
The principles of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (“DEIB”) are woven into the very fabric of our organization and guide how we recruit, retain, and develop our talent.
Our commitment to DEIB begins at the top and is underscored by the importance of making diverse perspectives a business imperative. This is reflected in the racially diverse and gendered-balanced leaders that make up our Board of Directors, management team, and employees, and who all share in our passion for contributing to and effecting change in communities globally.
We thrive on creating a dynamic, inclusive environment that aims to support and appreciate our employees as well as contribute to our award-winning company culture. We have ten active and engaged Employee Resource Groups that are aligned around dimensions of diversity, such as gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other shared attributes, which we believe help foster a sense of community, and a diverse and inclusive workplace. 
We also offer training sessions to our employees to emphasize awareness in self, bias and privilege, and inclusion. Further, we focus our global recruitment efforts on ensuring that teams and hiring managers have the opportunity to consider qualified people from historically excluded groups for open roles. Moreover, we distribute a bi-annual employment engagement survey to measure our employees’ satisfaction at Nextdoor, including employees’ perspective on our current state of workplace inclusivity.
Learning, Development, and Engagement
We have a dedicated Talent Management and Development team that develops and delivers company-wide people programs and learning and development experiences to help our employees grow in their careers. The programs include performance feedback and promotion cycles and recognition through our “Nextdoor Values Awards”. Our learning and development experiences focus on onboarding new hires as well as offering workshops focused on skills development and compliance training. Additionally, we offer employees a development stipend that they can use towards their professional development (e.g., career coaches, books, classes, conferences, tuition, etc.). 
We are committed to making Nextdoor the best place to work by engaging with, and listening to, our community of employees. We maintain ongoing connection with our team members through weekly all hands meetings, our speaker series, and bi-annual engagement surveys. 
Compensation, Benefits and Perks
We provide employees with competitive compensation packages that include base salaries, sales commissions for certain employees, and equity awards. Additional benefits programs (which vary by country and region) include a 401(k) Plan with a company match, healthcare, vision, and dental insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, flexible paid time off, parental leave, and other benefits tailored to the specific needs of our 
employees such as family forming, caregiving and mental health resources. We also support and encourage our employees to give back to our communities by giving each employee “Volunteer Time Off” to dedicate to the causes that matter most to them. 
Competition
We compete in almost every aspect of our business with companies that provide a variety of internet products, services, content, and online advertising, including Meta (including Facebook and Instagram), Alphabet (including Google), Pinterest, Snap, and Twitter. In addition, aspects of our platform compete with other products and services, including home services, classifieds, real estate, recommendations and search engines. We compete with these companies to attract, engage, and retain users and to attract and retain advertisers. As we introduce new products, as our platform evolves, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition in other countries. 
While our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive, we believe that we compete effectively due to our singular focus on creating and strengthening our neighborhood networks, the size and engagement of our user base, our ability to provide neighbors with trusted information from a uniquely local perspective, our value proposition to advertisers including businesses and public agencies, and our powerful network effects.
Our strengths are real people, hyperlocal proximity, trusted information, local perspective and instant distribution, each of which reinforce each other to create a strong competitive moat.
For additional information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors — Our business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.”
Government regulation
We are subject to many U.S. federal and state and foreign laws, regulations and industry standards that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations that involve data privacy and data protection, intellectual property (including copyright and patent laws), content regulation, rights of publicity, advertising, marketing, health and safety, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption, telecommunications, and securities. Our business may also be affected by the adoption of any new or existing laws or regulations or changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, or that significantly restrict or impose conditions on our ability to collect, store, augment, analyze, use and share data or increase consumer notice or consent requirements before a company can utilize cookies or other tracking technologies or that increase the liability of content platforms like us. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. 
We rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses relevant to the content available on our service, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”) and the fair-use doctrine in the United States, and the Electronic Commerce Directive in the European Union. However, each of these statutes is subject to uncertain or evolving judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. In addition, various countries around the world have adopted and pending legislation, including the forthcoming Digital Services Act (the “DSA”) in the European Union, that may impose additional obligations or liability on us associated with content uploaded by users to our platform. For example, in the United States, laws such as the CDA, which have previously been interpreted to provide substantial protection to interactive computer service providers, may change and become less predictable or unfavorable by legislative action or juridical interpretation. There have been various federal and state legislative efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under the CDA, in particular with regards to Section 230 of the CDA, and current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages.
We receive, process, store, use, and share data, some of which contains personal information. We are therefore subject to U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy and the collection, 
storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data from users, employees or business partners, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). Additionally, California recently enacted a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), and Colorado enacted the Colorado Data Privacy Act (“CDPA”), which have similar requirements and obligations to the CCPA. There are also a number of legislative proposals recently enacted or pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislatures and foreign governments concerning content regulation and data protection that could affect us, These and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretation of existing laws and regulations, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs in order to comply.
The costs of complying with these laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are high and likely to increase in the future, particularly as the degree of regulation increases, our business grows and our geographic scope expands. Further, the impact of these laws and regulations may disproportionately affect our business in comparison to our peers in the technology sector that have greater resources. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities or penalties, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Further, it is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all our products for an extended period of time or indefinitely.
We communicate with lawmakers and regulators in the countries and regions in which we do business. We have a dedicated policy team that monitors legal and regulatory developments and works with policymakers and regulators around the world to help ensure that our perspective is heard in matters of importance to us.
For additional information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters.”
