Overview
 
Our Mission
 
At Charles & Colvard, we believe luxury can be both beautiful and conscientious. With innovative technology and sustainable practices, our goal is to lead a revolution in the jewelry industry – delivering a brilliant product at extraordinary value balanced with environmental and social responsibility.
 
Charles & Colvard, Ltd., a North Carolina corporation founded in 1995 (which may be referred to as Charles & Colvard, we, us, or our), manufactures, markets and distributes Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® (which we refer to as moissanite or moissanite jewels) and finished jewelry featuring our proprietary moissanite gemstone for sale in the worldwide jewelry market. Our unique differentiator, moissanite – The World’s Most Brilliant Gem® – is core to our ambition to create a movement around beautiful, environmentally and socially responsible fine jewelry. Charles & Colvard is the original creator of lab-created moissanite, and we believe that we are leading the way in delivering the most pure form of this gemstone through technological advances in gemstone manufacturing, cutting, polishing and setting.

Our strategy is to build a globally revered brand of gemstones and jewelry that appeals to a wide consumer audience and leverages our advantage of being the original and leading worldwide source of created moissanite. We believe a direct relationship with consumers is important to this strategy, which entails delivering tailored educational content, engaging in dialogue with our audience, and positioning our brand to meet the discerning needs of today’s consumer. We sell loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry through two operating segments: our Online Channels segment, which comprises our charlesandcolvard.com website, e-commerce outlets, including marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay, and drop-ship customers, such as Overstock.com, and other pure-play, exclusively e-commerce customers, such as Gemvara; and our Traditional segment, which consists of wholesale, retail, and television customers. For more information about our operating segments, see Note 3, “Segment Information and Geographic Data”, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe our expanding application of an omni-channel sales strategy across the jewelry trade and to the end consumer with branded finished jewelry featuring moissanite positions Charles & Colvard goods at the many touchpoints where consumers are when they are making their buying decisions – thereby creating greater exposure for our brand and increasing consumer demand.
 
In February 2016, we made the strategic decision to explore a potential divestiture of our direct-to-consumer home party business previously operated through our Charles & Colvard Direct, LLC (dba Lulu Avenue®) subsidiary. After careful analysis of our core competencies, go-to-market strategies, and intent to advance toward profitability, the management team and Board of Directors determined a divestiture of this distribution channel to be in our best interest and our shareholders’ best interest. On March 4, 2016, we and Charles & Colvard Direct, LLC entered into an asset purchase agreement with Yanbal USA, Inc., or Yanbal, under which Yanbal purchased certain assets related to our direct-to-consumer home party business for $500,000 and assumed certain liabilities related to such assets. A more detailed description of this transaction is included in Note 13, “Discontinued Operations”, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Our Market Opportunity
 
According to Forbes.com and McKinsey & Company, by 2020 the global online fashion jewelry market is expected to drive $45 billion in sales – representing 15% of the global jewelry market – and global online fine jewelry is projected to represent a staggering $30 billion of the global jewelry market. Concurrently, according to the Wall Street Journal, the lab-created gemstone opportunity is expected to reach an $8 billion market size. We believe this convergence of the online fine jewelry shopper and the emergence of lab-created gemstones as a solution to the underserved, ethically-minded value consumer shapes a bright and sizeable future opportunity for Charles & Colvard and jewelry designed with our exceptional gemstone.
Our Strategic Direction
 
As consumers have shifted to significant levels of online shopping and buying, in particular, the Millennial generation, we have had to transform our go-to-market strategy in a relatively short period. Our historical business was that of a gemstone manufacturer, and as such, we created gemstones, and leveraged our distributor networks as the primary method for delivering our goods to market. That meant relying on our network partners to generate interest and sales for our gemstone, while they were doing the same for other gemstones and jewelry across the industry. Consequently, we believe there was a substantial lack of market awareness for moissanite.
 
In order to address these issues, we began building a new leadership team in December 2015. This team increased the focus on the importance of a direct connection with the consumer, and over the course of the last two years began implementing new strategies to strike a dialogue with this audience.
 
In October 2016, we re-launched Charles & Colvard with the intent to position both Charles & Colvard and its innovative moissanite product – Forever OneTM – as a premium gemstone and jewelry brand. During this pivotal time, we launched the charlesandcolvard.com web site as our primary storefront, established our brand across key social media properties, and began a significant digital marketing campaign to gain exposure, build brand awareness, and begin the journey of establishing a lifetime relationship with consumers that are seeking an alternative luxury brand that aligns with their buying preferences.

2017 was a year of growth and optimization of our branding initiatives. We progressed the business from our 2016 re-launch, and focused on driving consumer awareness while making calculated marketing and sales investments as we engaged new channel partners and forged inroads into new markets. Over the course of the year, we executed our strategic plan with new innovations in our Forever OneTM product line and finished jewelry offerings. We invested in key retail and wholesale partnerships, as evidenced by our brick-and-mortar expansion into nearly all Helzberg Diamonds stores. We explored new channels, applying our e-commerce expertise as we rolled-out our inaugural presence on Tmall® in China, and achieving authorized Seller-Fulfilled Prime status on Amazon.com. We believe that we have improved the customer experience with our brand by taking such actions as offering free shipping and introducing a 60-day free returns policy. We also believe that we were able to amplify our global marketing efforts as we advanced toward profitability. A more detailed description of our achievements in 2017 is included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Our strategy for 2018 is to focus on growth and market expansion across channels and geographies. As competitive moissanite makes its way to market, there is no more important time than now to confirm Charles & Colvard’s leadership position as the premier worldwide moissanite provider and to further establish our presence in emerging markets.  Our key strategies for 2018 are:
 
 
· | Drive organic revenue growth in the U.S. and maintain attractive margins – We plan to continue engaging our target customers through creative and progressive marketing campaigns and leverage technology to ensure efficiencies in our marketing, sales and customer service functions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand our gemstone and jewelry offerings to serve a broad range of customers – We plan to continue innovating our moissanite gemstone offerings and further enhance our jewelry offerings to include unique, curated collections and new styles at multiple price points that will appeal to a broad audience.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Target the global market opportunity through continued brand building, focused channel expansion and world-class customer service – We plan to diversify and expand our global customer base in a low-risk manner by introducing our brand in select markets via cross-border trade initiatives and through established marketplaces.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Balance growth-oriented investments to generate sustainable earnings improvement – We plan to maintain financial flexibility and use data-driven business decisions to balance investments in future growth with consistent near-term financial performance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Guiding Principles
 
One of the most critical factors in implementing our strategies and achieving success is our team of employees. We carefully develop, support and reward our team members, making sure they know our fundamental mission, which is to lead a revolution in the jewelry industry – delivering a brilliant product at an extraordinary value balanced with environmental and social responsibility. We have set forth Guiding Principles that set the tone for everything we do – from structuring our interactions with partners, customers and shareholders to the way we operate our business, and the products we bring to market. Following are the principles that guide our actions:

· | Catalyze – Build positive momentum with customers and influencers by being thoughtful and trustworthy in every interaction.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Innovate – Disrupt the jewelry industry through use of technology – in gemstone and jewelry design, business processes and engagement with our audience.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Aspire – Be socially conscious, economically informed and environmentally responsible. Build a sustainable business and give back through community acts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Obsess – Think like a consumer, act like a friend. Constantly seek ways to reduce friction between the brand and our audience.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Achieve – Focus attention on the interdependent successes of individual, brand and shareholder.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enrich – Promote personal growth and the ability to affect positive change in the business by cultivating a culture of critical thinking and creativity.

Our Audience
 
Our consumer audience is in transition. Historically, our audience has been largely comprised of Baby Boomers and Generation X – which we consider an older set of consumers driven by a traditional style of jewelry. Today, our market research and buying habit analytics indicate that, regardless of demographic, our audience appears to be driven by three distinct motivating factors: (1) Beauty – the innate brilliance of our gemstone and jewelry selection; (2) Value – the “bang for the buck” possible with moissanite, and the ability to buy luxury items while saving money for the more important things in life; and (3) Conscientiousness – having a positive impact on the world by buying from brands that are environmentally and socially responsible.
 
Our marketing programs are driven by this understanding of our audience and their motivating factors. Their mindset drives the segmented messages we deliver, defines the partners and kindred brands we select and co-promote with, and determines the channels in which we engage with our audience.
 
While these common motivating factors transcend demographics, we believe that we are seeing distinct trends that lend themselves to highly targeted marketing programs. Most distinctly, we have discovered – what we refer to as the conscientiousness factor – emanating from the Millennial and burgeoning Generation Z demographics. We believe that today’s younger consumers are socially and ethically wired. They appear to proactively seek out goods and services that align with their core principles and become devoted and vocal advocates of brands that embody ‘green’ practices. This consumer group is our fastest growing online channels demographic.
 
In summary, we believe our beautiful, high value, ethically-sourced product aligns directly with the principles and purchasing requirements of our primary target – the Millennial audience. However, we believe that we also appeal to a broader range of demographics for whom we can deliver tailored promotional programs that speak to their distinct motivating factors.
 
Marketing to the Online Channels Segment
 
Driven by knowledge of our changing audience, we adjusted our strategy and marketing tactics throughout 2017 and proactively engaged the consumer through a multi-channel digital marketing strategy. Our goal is to continue growing our direct relationship with the consumer, which we believe will drive interest across all of our selling channels. Our approach for marketing directly to the consumer includes the following online programs:

· | Social Media – To reinforce and support our position as the leading source of ethically-sourced, lab-created moissanite, our marketing team manages several social media initiatives that target current and future jewelry consumers to support the promotion and sale of Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite®. Our campaigns are focused on driving a consistent message emphasizing the environmentally and socially responsible aspects of our jewels, their everlasting beauty, and overall value. Our social media efforts include both owned posts and engagements (our own profiles and activities) as well as paid placement (ads presented to targeted audiences).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Digital Marketing – According to a recent research study by Forrester Research, Inc., a global independent research, data, and advisory services firm, 71% of consumers begin their buying journeys by using a web search to discover new products and services. In short, the typical buyer’s journey is a digital one. Digital marketing encompasses the myriad ways we can be a part of that journey – from Search Engine Marketing (keyword buys and ads) to digital display (banner ads and product re-targeting ads) to video pre-roll (ads playing before third-party YouTube videos), and native advertising (long-form content produced in conjunction with editorial outlets such as Refinery29®). We are using, and continually optimizing, available digital marketing channels and will continue to monitor new forms of paid media as they arise, assessing whether they will be effective in helping us connect with our target audiences.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Influencer Campaigns – According to Forbes Magazine and a study from MuseFind Technologies Inc., a leading U.S. influencer marketing authority, up to 92% of consumers trust an influencer more than an ad or traditional celebrity endorsement. This is a clear indicator of what marketers have already come to accept: that people trust other people more than they trust brands. However, we believe there is a caveat: the influencers that a brand partners with must truly be aligned in mindset. We do not believe that we can simply find someone with millions of followers, pay them to post about our brand and product, and expect to see results. Instead, we believe we must find influencers who embody the same mindset as our brand and believe in the products we bring to market. This takes time, and we plan to continue to build our influencer network throughout 2018.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 4
 

 
· | Sweepstakes – We believe sweepstakes, especially leveraging social media platforms in partnership with kindred brands, are powerful in acquiring and engaging new audiences. Through the use of sweepstakes in 2017, we increased our email marketing subscribers and social media followers, generated a multitude of user-generated content about our brand and products, and converted new customers. Sweepstakes will be a marketing tactic we intend to expand upon throughout 2018.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A Twist on the Traditional TV Channel – Throughout our history, we have utilized TV as a channel to reach our consumers. In 2017, we identified a shift in our audience and how they began to disengage from TV and shift to online and streaming video. We are combining our years of knowledge about video marketing, and the power of seeing our product in motion, with our growing expertise in digital marketing. These efforts are expected to culminate in extensive use of video marketing and livestream video in 2018.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Consumer Education – Because we believe education of the consumer is so important to the sell-through of moissanite products, we continue to enhance our website and contribute to third party platforms such as social media sites to share extensive educational information about moissanite, in addition to general background information about our company. But we do not believe our value to the marketplace is only realized in our product. As our goal is to lead a revolution in the jewelry industry, we also have a commitment to providing value through education of the jewelry market by bringing to light the environmental and social impact of the trade as a whole. We plan to continue to create content of value on our own site and social channels and to contribute more to third party platforms, sharing extensive educational information about environmentally and socially responsible, lab-grown moissanite.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributing to the Online Channels Segment
 
Equally as important to us as marketing to our direct consumer audience is moving our customers through the process of engaging with our brand – and eventually converting into a lifetime customer. Throughout the above marketing tactics, we employ calls to action that drive the consumer to the many places where they can view our products and complete their purchase. We utilize a centralized distribution and fulfillment facility in Morrisville, North Carolina, to fulfill online channels orders. Following are our primary online transactional channels:

· | charlesandcolvard.com – In 2017, we significantly enhanced our transactional web site to optimize for the mobile consumer and to reduce friction between our brand and the consumer. Programs such as free shipping, a 60-day return policy, and an enhanced and optimized shopping experience were rolled out in time for the 2017 holiday season. With data collected through web analytics, and through user surveys that reveal how consumers use the site, we are in a continual state of optimizing the buying experience – making it easier for shoppers to browse, sort and compare. Through the use of partners such as Affirm, Inc., and PayPal Holdings, Inc., or PayPal, for financing purchases, Braintree, a service of PayPal, for ease of transfer, and cross-border trade, or CBT, services, we are continually focused on improving our customers’ experience.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Marketplaces – As noted previously, a large majority of buyers start their online shopping experience with a web search. According to BloomReach, Inc., a global content management firm, as many as 55% of those searches begin on Amazon. That number skews even higher within the Millennial demographic – based on a finding by the Pew Research Center, a renowned nonpartisan fact think tank, Amazon is the brand Millennials identify as most relevant. Therefore, we have made a point to be prominent on Amazon, achieving Seller-Fulfilled Prime status in 2017, which means we have the option of fulfilling orders with the same benefits of Amazon Prime. This will enable us to be positioned more prominently in Amazon’s search platform and to take advantage of their negotiated shipping rates and service levels that, in turn, will lower our shipping costs. This status is available by Amazon to only those sellers who have a history of fulfilling orders quickly and not running out of stock. We are also prominent on eBay and a multitude of other specialty marketplaces, allowing us to meet our customers where they want to buy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Pure-Play E-tailers – Bain & Company, a global management consulting firm, estimates that 28% of total retail sales will become e-commerce centric by 2030. As consumers become more digitally savvy, new businesses have gained traction by tailoring their product, services and experiences to specific consumer preferences. We believe that these pure-play e-tailers offer unique opportunities for Charles & Colvard to feature our gemstones and connect with their loyal audiences. As our 2018 strategy evolves, we plan to focus on expanding these relationships and forging new partnerships that enable us to reach differentiated audiences.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Drop Ship Retail – Retailers are consistently seeking socially responsible brands to serve the growing demand for conscientious product selection from their audiences. In an effort to smartly expand their assortment, they utilize drop-ship as it enables them to offer a more robust assortment online without having to physically take ownership of the goods in their warehouse. As we have refined charlesandcolvard.com’s post-purchase customer experience to deliver fast shipping and a streamlined return process, we are leveraging these enhanced processes to support the increasing opportunity among retailers that are incorporating drop-ship as core to their online assortment expansion strategy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cross-Border Trade – According to statistics from Statista.com (based on data from Shopify Inc., a global cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform), with 84% of global e-commerce sales predicted to take place outside of Europe and North America by 2020, we anticipate combining regionalized marketing efforts in new geographies with promotional campaigning to drive international consumers to our charlesandcolvard.com web property. Through the application of market-leading CBT technology, we believe CBT to be a significant opportunity in 2018 and beyond.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing to the Traditional Channels Segment
 
The Traditional Channels segment is our legacy channel – representing such outlets as distributor partners, brick-and-mortar retail, and traditional television shopping. These channels remain important avenues for Charles & Colvard to drive product to market, and be present in the many places the consumer takes their shopping journey.

· | Trade advertising – In 2017, we continued to target the trade with print advertisements featuring moissanite, with specific emphasis on our Forever OneTM moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring the Forever OneTM jewel in leading trade publications. We intend to continue to deliver meaningful promotion of Forever OneTM as we further expand this product line into the wholesale distribution segment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Industry associations – We maintain relationships with major jewelry industry organizations and jewelry trade publications as an opportunity to communicate with our peers on a consistent basis through media coverage, trade shows, and charitable events, among others.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Trade shows – Our attendance at leading jewelry trade shows as a sponsor, an exhibitor, or a participant has helped us extend our outreach to customers. In 2017, we attended major domestic and international jewelry industry trade shows including JCK, North America’s largest annual jewelry trade event in Las Vegas, and the Hong Kong Gem and Jewellery Fair. We intend to continue investing in these important industry events in 2018.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cooperative advertising – We sometimes participate in the cooperative advertising programs of our distributor and retail partners, subject to the customer adhering to our branding guidelines and other conditions. In these programs, we subsidize a portion of their marketing costs in order to create awareness of and exposure for our gemstones and jewelry.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributing to the Traditional Channels Segment
 
We utilize a centralized distribution and fulfillment facility in Morrisville, North Carolina, to fill bulk orders to manufacturer, distributor, and retail customers.
 
 
· | Retail – In order to create awareness and exposure for our gemstones, jewelry, and brands, we sell loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite at wholesale prices to nationally recognized and emerging retail customers through a broad range of channels including jewelry chains, television shopping networks, and department stores. Wholesale orders are received via purchase order and filled from our centralized distribution and fulfillment center. In addition, we have placed loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry inventory in stores on a consignment basis. We continue to evolve our retail channel strategy as we optimize our historical methods and partners. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Domestic Manufacturers and Distributors – In order to service the vast number of independent jewelers, jewelry stores, and smaller jewelry chains, we sell our loose moissanite jewels to domestic wholesale distributors and finished jewelry manufacturers at distributor prices, that in turn set them in mountings and sell them to retailers, sell them through their own e-commerce sites, or resell the loose jewels at a markup to independent jewelers and jewelry stores – whether brick-and-mortar, online, or both. In addition, we have placed loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry inventory with select domestic distributors on a consignment basis. We continue to evaluate our channel strategy for domestic distributors, which may result in a change to our historical domestic distributor methods and partners.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | International Manufacturers and Distributors – In order to create global awareness and exposure for our gemstones, jewelry, and brands, we sell loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite to international wholesale distributors and finished jewelry manufacturers at distributor prices, that in turn set them in mountings and sell them to retailers, sell them through their own e-commerce sites, or resell the loose jewels at a markup to independent jewelers and jewelry stores in their local markets. We currently have more than 15 international wholesale distributors covering portions of Canada, the UK, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and China. In addition, we have placed loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry inventory with select international distributors on a consignment basis. We continue to evaluate our channel strategy for international distributors, which may result in a change to our historical international distributor methods and partners. A portion of our international sales consists of finished jewels sold internationally that may be re-imported to U.S. retailers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



For a discussion of our largest customers for 2017 and 2016, see Note 14, “Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk”, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales in the retail jewelry industry are typically seasonal due to increased consumer purchases during the holiday season. Because historically we have primarily sold our loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite at wholesale pricing to distributors, manufacturers, and retailers, our sales to support the holiday season have largely taken place during the third and beginning of the fourth calendar quarters, depending on the sales channel and the level of advanced planning and production our customers undertook. However, the effect of seasonality on our business is also impacted by the timing of orders we receive to support new or expanded distribution and the level of current inventory positions held by our customers. In recent years, excluding one-time sales events from time to time throughout the year, we have experienced a higher degree of seasonality in the fourth quarter than we have experienced in prior years primarily as a result of the holiday season sales to end consumers through our growing direct-to-consumer e-commerce website, charlesandcolvard.com and as a result of increased sales through our Online Channels segment. In future periods, as sales of our finished jewelry increase to retailers and directly to consumers, both in dollars and as a percentage of total sales, we anticipate a seasonality trend more typical with the retail jewelry industry, and these factors may significantly affect our results of operations in a given quarter.
 
Change in Fiscal Year-End
 
On January 30, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year from a fiscal year beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 of each year to a fiscal year beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30 of each year. This change in our fiscal year-end enables management to shift its annual planning and budgeting process away from the holiday season, so that management’s focus during that time is on revenue-generating opportunities with customers. This change to the fiscal year reporting cycle will begin July 1, 2018. As a result of the change, we will have a six-month transition period from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018. During this period, we plan to file our results for the three-month period ending March 31, 2018 in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2018 and to file a transition report with our results for the six-month period ending June 30, 2018 on Form 10-KT with the SEC.

Moissanite
 
Over 120 years ago, Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Henri Moissan, Ph.D., first discovered the extremely rare mineral, silicon carbide, or SiC, in a meteorite crater in Arizona. Over a century after the discovery of SiC, and after years of experimentation, researchers from the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina developed and patented a thermal growing process for creating pure SiC crystals in a controlled laboratory environment. This long-sought-after breakthrough made possible the world’s first lab-created moissanite gemstone – posthumously named after its discoverer. With hardness rivaling any mineral on earth, and optical properties exceeding all mined and created gemstones, we believe moissanite is a brilliant new type of jewel that is free from environmental and ethical issues, and capable of disrupting traditional definitions of fine jewelry.
 
Naturally-occurring moissanite is generally very small in size, dark green or black in color, and not a commercially viable source of gemstone material. Therefore, in order to create high quality moissanite material in desirable colors and across a range of carat sizes that will appeal to a consumer audience, we expect only lab-grown SiC crystals to provide a sustainable source of moissanite for gemstones. In addition to carat size, important characteristics of a gemstone are beauty, durability, and rarity. The beauty of a near-colorless and colorless gemstone is characterized by its color, brilliance, and fire. The brilliance of a gemstone is measured by its refractive index, or the extent to which, when coupled with the facet design, the gemstone reflects light. The fire of a gemstone, or the breaking of light rays into spectral colors, is measured by its dispersion. Durability is determined by a gemstone’s hardness, or resistance to scratching and toughness, or resistance to chipping or cleaving. Rarity is the availability or perceived availability of a gemstone.
 
Moissanite jewels have a unique combination of brilliance, fire, durability, and rarity. Moissanite’s beauty is objectively derived from its refractive index, which is higher than any other gemstone, including diamond. And its hardness is greater than all minerals, and all known gemstone materials with the exception of diamond. As a result, moissanite jewels, like diamond, can be cut with sharp, well-defined, and highly polished facets that accentuate their brilliance and fire. The cutting specifications (facet arrangement and proportions) for moissanite jewels are different than any other gemstone, and designed to maximize the brilliance and fire of the material. We evaluate the finished jewels to exacting standards with automated video-imaging equipment and specially trained quality control personnel. Due to the rare natural occurrence of moissanite and both the proprietary and technical limitations in producing mass quantities of gem-grade moissanite, we believe that moissanite is among the rarest of jewels.

The following table compares the physical properties of moissanite jewels with other fine gemstone materials:
 

Description | Refractive Index | | Dispersion | | Hardness (1) | Toughness
--------------------------------------+------------------+-----------+------------+-------+--------------+----------
Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® | | 2.65-2.69 | | 0.104 | | | 9.25 – 9.5 | Excellent 
Diamond | | 2.42 | | 0.044 | | | 10 | Good to Excellent (2)
Ruby | | 1.77 | | 0.018 | | | 9 | Excellent (3) 
Sapphire | | 1.77 | | 0.018 | | | 9 | Excellent (3) 
Emerald | | 1.58 | | 0.014 | | | 7.50 | Poor to Good 

 
(1) For purposes of this table, “hardness” is based on the Mohs Scale, which is a relative scale only. Quantitative comparisons of different gemstone materials cannot be made directly using the Mohs Scale. Moissanite jewels, while harder than all other known gemstones, are approximately one-half as hard as diamond.
 (2) In cleavage direction, toughness is “good”
 (3) Except twinned stones

Products and Product Development
 
Moissanite jewels
 
Historically, Charles & Colvard primarily sold near-colorless moissanite jewels including Forever ClassicTM and Forever Brilliant®. We continue to offer these products in a variety of shapes including round, square brilliant, princess, cushion, radiant, pear, marquise, heart, and oval, among others, in sizes ranging from approximately 1.3 to 12 millimeters (approximately 0.008 to 5.3 carats).  In 2015, we announced availability of our premier product, the first colorless moissanite jewel, Forever OneTM, which grades from colorless (D-E-F) to near-colorless (G-H-I) using the Gemological Institute of America’s color grading scale. Our limited launch was met with great enthusiasm from channel partners and consumers.  In response to this demand, we continue to expand our Forever OneTM product line with additional shapes and sizes. Today, we offer Forever OneTM in 14 cuts, and a multitude of sizes ranging from melee accent stones as small as .005 carats to gemstones up to 6.13 carats, and our recently-released Exotics that are as large as 15.55 carats diamond equivalent weight (“DEW”).
 
Moissanite finished jewelry
 
We began selling finished jewelry featuring moissanite in 2010. Our core designs include stud earrings, solitaire and three-stone rings, pendants, and bracelets. We are now selling an expanded selection of fashion-oriented, designer-inspired moissanite jewelry that we offer as an expansion to the core line of jewelry. The primary ingredients of our moissanite finished jewelry are loose moissanite jewels that we have on hand as part of our finished goods inventory, white, yellow, and rose gold settings, sterling silver settings, and labor to mount the jewels into the settings.
 
In addition, we historically purchased fashion finished jewelry comprising base metals and non-precious gemstones for sale through Lulu Avenue®. This finished jewelry was fashion oriented and subject to styling trends that could change with each catalog season. The majority of this finished jewelry was custom designed for us. We made limited purchases of fashion finished jewelry after the divestiture of our direct-to-consumer home party business on March 4, 2016.

Source of Raw Material
 
Our moissanite jewels are made from gem-grade SiC crystals. Our sole supplier of SiC crystals is Cree, Inc., or Cree, with which we have certain exclusive supply rights for SiC crystals to be used for gemstone applications. We source the metals used for our finished jewelry, including white, yellow, and rose gold and sterling silver, from a number of domestic and international manufacturers located in the U.S, China, India, Mexico, or Hong Kong. In line with our goal of providing socially and ethically-sourced products, we require suppliers to adhere to our stringent supplier guidelines, as well as to certify that their gold is coming from conflict free sources and that all metals supplied to us are responsibly sourced.
Exclusive Supply Agreement with Cree
 
On December 12, 2014, we entered into a new exclusive supply agreement with Cree, or the Supply Agreement, which superseded and replaced our prior agreement with Cree. Under the Supply Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions, we agreed to exclusively purchase from Cree, and Cree agreed to exclusively supply 100% of our required SiC materials in quarterly installments that must equal or exceed a set minimum order quantity. The initial term of the Supply Agreement will expire on June 24, 2018, unless extended by the parties. Accordingly, we are reviewing various alternatives with respect to our purchase of SiC material, including whether to exercise our unilateral option, subject to certain conditions, to renew the Supply Agreement for an additional two-year period. Our total purchase commitment under the Supply Agreement until June 2018 is dependent upon the size of the SiC material and ranges between approximately $29.60 million and approximately $31.50 million. As of December 31, 2017, our remaining purchase commitment through June 2018 under the Supply Agreement ranges from approximately $5.15 million to approximately $7.05 million.
Intellectual Property
 
We held U.S. product and method patents for moissanite jewels that expired during 2015, under which we had broad, exclusive rights to manufacture, use, and sell moissanite jewels in the U.S. We held these same patents in 25 foreign jurisdictions primarily across Asia and Europe that expired in the third quarter of 2016, and will expire in Mexico in 2021. In addition, we have certain trademarks and pending trademark applications that support our moissanite branding strategy. Since the expiration of our patents we have noted new providers of moissanite entering the market. We know how challenging it is to create high-quality moissanite and anticipate it will take emerging providers significant time and investment to bring meaningful and competitive products to market. As we experienced ourselves, we anticipate it will take these new providers significant time to evolve from producing low-end moissanite to delivering high-quality gemstones in the colorless or near-colorless range. Achieving the capacity to consistently produce a high-quality moissanite product at mass scale requires a careful balance of silicon carbide-specific faceting skills and a well-tuned global supply chain. Therefore, we do not anticipate direct moissanite competition in our superior quality gemstone ranges in the foreseeable future.
 
Our success and our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our proprietary technology. In addition to our remaining international patents, we rely on trade secret laws and employee, consultant, and customer confidentiality agreements to protect certain aspects of our technology. We currently are not subject to any claims that our products or processes infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. At the present time, we are also dependent on Cree’s technology for the production of SiC crystals.
 
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 
Moissanite jewels
 
The production of Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® jewels is an elaborate process developed over a number of years of collaborative research and development, acquired and learned knowledge from scientists, and considerable investment expense.
 
 10
 

Following are the key manufacturing processes of our moissanite jewels:
 
 
· | Growing gem-grade raw SiC crystals;
--+------------------------------------


· | Manufacturing rough preforms;
--+------------------------------


· | Faceting and polishing jewels;
--+-------------------------------


· | Inspecting, sorting, and grading; and
--+--------------------------------------


· | Engraving.
--+-----------



Growing gem-grade raw SiC crystals – SiC crystal growth suitable for gem-grade usage at commercial quantities is proprietary both in design and in operational methodology. Cree has grown the majority of our SiC crystals in accordance with the terms of the Supply Agreement. We routinely evaluate the yield and quality of saleable moissanite jewels from SiC crystals. The yield of saleable jewels from each crystal is one of the most significant factors affecting the volume and cost of moissanite jewels available for sale. Yield is dependent on the quality of the crystals, and variations in crystal quality can adversely affect our gross margin percentage.
 
Manufacturing rough preforms – We have made considerable investment in the design, development, and customization of a proprietary manufacturing process that includes equipment, software, and procedures to maximize raw material yield. The result is production of intermediary shapes, called “preforms,” that vary depending upon the size and shape of the desired finished jewel. We continue to invest research and development resources to improve raw material yield, including studying alternate preform shapes and cutting technologies, due to the dramatic effect such an improvement could have on our gross margin percentage.
 
Faceting and polishing jewels – Each preform is faceted and polished by our independent third-party gem-cutters based on master designs with multiple quality control measures built into the process. Gem-cutter training is a regimented program involving several months of progressive hands-on bench training. As we continue to expand the assortment of Forever One™, we will continue the process of certifying additional cutters to ensure sufficient scalability of our production capabilities to meet anticipated demand for this premium finished jewel.
 
Inspecting, sorting, and grading – Similar to other gemstones, each faceted moissanite jewel greater than 2.5 millimeters in size is individually graded against established master standards using our specially trained personnel. Additionally, as part of our overall quality assurance program, a representative sample from each batch of jewels is submitted to an image analyzer to ensure critical angles and other attributes designed to maximize moissanite’s optical properties are consistently maintained. This phase of manufacturing is relatively labor-intensive and requires skills not readily available in the general work force. In the future, we may elect to outsource certain portions of this stage of the manufacturing process to independent third parties that we will require to adhere to our rigorous quality control and monitoring standards.
 
Engraving – For moissanite gemstones over four millimeters in size, Charles & Colvard laser inscribes an identifying code on the girdle of each gemstone. This identifier matches a grading standard and is an important element in protecting the integrity of Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® and ensuring the customer an authentic Charles & Colvard gemstone.
 
Finished jewelry
 
Our line of finished jewelry featuring moissanite is developed by a team of industry experts integrating our moissanite jewels into many forms of jewelry, generally made of precious metals, either designed or purchased by us utilizing a core group of suppliers, manufacturers, and finishers. In addition to our Limited Lifetime Warranty offered on our moissanite jewels, we provide a 12-month Limited Warranty on all finished jewelry featuring our moissanite.
 
Our prior line of fashion finished jewelry, comprised of base metals and non-precious gemstones for sale through Lulu Avenue®, was either designed exclusively for us and manufactured to our specifications or purchased from a core group of suppliers and manufacturers. We made limited purchases of fashion finished jewelry after the divestiture of our direct-to-consumer home party business on March 4, 2016.
 
 11
 

All procured finished jewelry components are sourced from our approved suppliers, and each finished jewelry item is jobbed and/or tracked by stock keeping unit (“SKU”), utilizing our enterprise resource planning system. The components of moissanite finished jewelry comprised in each job are then manufactured into finished jewelry by assemblers either in the U.S. or internationally in China, India, Mexico, or Hong Kong. We are continuously working with our existing manufacturing partners, as well as identifying new manufacturing partners, to expand our assortments and efficiencies.
 
All finished jewelry produced by Charles & Colvard undergoes a multi-point inspection process. A representative sampling of manufactured finished jewelry items undergoes stone and metals testing to ensure that the items for sale are of the quality that we strive to maintain. Also, in line with our goal of providing socially and ethically-sourced products, we require suppliers of our gold to certify that the gold is coming from conflict free sources and that all metals supplied to us are responsibly sourced. If required by government ordinance or requested by a customer, we facilitate the inspection of our finished jewelry by internationally recognized testing facilities to comply with legal requirements and to ensure consumer confidence.
 
Working Capital Practices
 
Our primary source of working capital is cash on hand and cash generated by operations. Because we have a quarterly minimum purchase commitment under the Supply Agreement, we may be required to purchase SiC materials in excess of our immediate needs from time to time, which may result in inventories that are higher than we might otherwise maintain.
 
Payment terms on trade receivables for our Traditional segment customers are generally between 30 and 120 days, though we may offer extended terms with specific customers and on significant orders from time to time. We extend credit to our customers based upon a number of factors, including an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and credit history that is verified through trade association reference services, the customer’s payment history with us, the customer’s reputation in the trade, and/or an evaluation of the customer’s opportunity to introduce our moissanite jewels or finished jewelry featuring moissanite to new or expanded markets.
 
Our return policy for certain customers in our Online Channels segment provides for the return of purchases for any reason generally within 60 days of shipment in accordance with our warranty policy as disclosed on the charlesandcolvard.com website. Our return policy for customers in our Online Channels segment (excluding those of charlesandcolvard.com) and those in our Traditional segment allows for the return of jewels and finished jewelry for credit generally within 30 days of shipment if returned for a valid reason. We have established an allowance for returns based on our historical return rate, which takes into account any contractual return privileges granted to our customers. Periodically, we ship loose jewel goods, finished jewelry goods, and finished goods inventory to Traditional segment customers on consignment terms. Under these terms, the customer assumes the risk of loss and has an absolute right of return for a specified period that typically ranges from six months to one year.
 
Competition
 
As competitive moissanite makes its way to market, there is no more important time than now to confirm Charles & Colvard’s leadership position as the premier worldwide moissanite provider and to further establish our presence in emerging markets. We believe our leadership position is a product of over 20 years of moissanite innovation, and is bolstered by the following strengths:

· | Our exclusive SiC crystal supply agreement with Cree, which holds the U.S. patent for micropipe-free silicon carbide material and the related method of manufacture. We believe this core material empowers Charles & Colvard to rise above all other moissanite with an unrivaled level of gemstone clarity.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Over 20 years of innovation and continuous improvement of our moissanite gemstone. With Forever OneTM, we believe that we have achieved a level of perfection that is rarely seen in any gemstone – featuring colorless grades with an innovative cut that we believe reveals optical properties unrivaled by any other jewel. This pinnacle of production is the outcome of continual improvement and artisan craft.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



With our above strengths outlined, it is also important to note that our future competitive success is reliant, in part, on the following:
 
 
· | our ability to continue our relationship with Cree in order to sustain our supply of high-quality SiC crystals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to operationally execute the strategy for our Online Channels segment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Gemstones and Jewelry
 
Gemstone materials can be grouped into three types:
 
 
· | natural gemstone, which is found in nature;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | synthetic gemstone, which has the same chemical composition and essentially the same physical and optical characteristics of natural gemstone but is created in a lab; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | simulated or substitute material, which is similar in appearance to natural gemstone but does not have the same chemical composition, physical properties, or optical characteristics.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Our moissanite jewels compete with fine gemstones such as ruby, sapphire, emerald, and tanzanite as well as with natural, synthetic, and treated diamonds as a synthetic gemstone. We may also face competition from synthetic diamonds, synthetic diamond films, and other sources of synthetic moissanite not presently available in qualities, sizes, and volumes suitable for use as gemstones. Some suppliers of diamonds and other fine gemstones, as well as the suppliers of synthetic and simulated gemstones, may have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, and marketing resources and greater access to distribution channels than we do.

We believe A Diamond Is Forever® (which is a registered trademark of the De Beers Group of Companies) is one of the greatest marketing achievements, ever. Not only did the campaign persuade nearly four full generations that a diamond was the only true way to express love, but apparently it even made it taboo to spend less than three months’ salary to achieve what we believe is an artificially inflated value based on a throttled supply chain. Further, we believe it put marketing of any clear gemstone at a disadvantage due to people’s natural tendency to compare. However, as Millennials have entered the jewelry market with a new mindset of economic awareness, environmental responsibility and social consciousness, we believe the market opportunity has evolved. We believe moissanite – and specifically, Charles & Colvard – is primed to take advantage of the market in which people are actively looking for an alternative to diamond.
 
Competing with diamond
 
The worldwide market for large, uncut, high-quality natural diamonds is significantly consolidated and controlled by De Beers (headquartered in South Africa), Alrosa (Russia), Rio Tinto (Australia), and BHP (Canada). These companies have a major impact on the worldwide supply and pricing of natural diamonds at both the wholesale and retail levels. Diamond producers may undertake additional marketing or other activities designed to protect the diamond jewelry market against sales erosion from consumer acceptance of moissanite jewels. However, there are signs that the diamond industry is under pressure, with the De Beers Group of Companies recently reporting that the average price of goods sold to trade clients (consolidated sales) was $162 per carat. This is 13% lower than the average price achieved in 2016. We believe these indicators show a change in consumer confidence in the diamond trade.
 
We may also face competition from treated and synthetic diamonds. Treated diamonds, which are natural diamonds with imperfections or flaws that have been altered in some manner to enhance their appearance, have been available in the jewelry industry for the past several decades and are generally less expensive than diamonds of similar size, cut, and color that have not been altered. Synthetic diamonds are also available in the marketplace and are produced for jewelry applications available to consumers.
 
We have seen a recent emergence of new manufacturers of lab-grown diamonds that offer a product directly competitive with natural diamond; however, they are priced below that of natural diamond, and therefore compete with Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite®. Although we believe that colorless gemstone-quality synthetic and treated diamonds cannot presently be produced at prices competitive with those currently offered for our moissanite jewels, there can be no assurance that such competitive prices cannot be achieved in the future by the producers of any natural, synthetic or treated diamonds. The primary producers of synthetic diamonds used for industrial applications are Element Six (a member of the De Beers Group of Companies) and Sumitomo Electric Industries. There are also a number of Russian producers of synthetic diamonds for industrial uses. In addition, companies such as Diamonex (a Morgan Technical Ceramics Company) and Scio Diamond Technology Corporation are synthesizing diamonds in limited quantities, limited carat sizes, and in limited ranges of color. Synthetic diamond films can be grown at commercially viable prices in thicknesses that can be applied to various surfaces such as other synthetic materials.
 
Competing with other moissanite producers
 
Although we believe that our moissanite jewels have a leadership market position, we are beginning to face competition from other companies that develop competing SiC material.  These products are emerging primarily from Eastern countries, and are making their way into the U.S. market. Our ongoing research of the competitive landscape has identified competing moissanite in the “E-F” and below color range according to the Gemological Institute of America’s grading scale. However, we have not yet identified competing moissanite that exhibits a level of cut, clarity or polish that is competitive with Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite®. We also have not identified new sources that have exhibited the ability to supply a consistent and high volume of quality moissanite substantial enough to address the considerable consumption needs of distributors and retailers that serve the jewelry trade. Achieving the capacity to consistently produce a high-quality moissanite product at mass scale requires a careful balance of SiC-specific faceting skills and a well-tuned global supply chain. Therefore, we do not anticipate direct moissanite competition in our superior quality gemstone ranges for the foreseeable future.
 
 14
 

Competing with simulants and synthetics
 
We may also, to a lesser degree, face competition from existing diamond simulants and other synthetic gemstones, including cubic zirconia. Producers and sellers of these products may see the markets for these products being eroded by the market penetration of our moissanite jewels. We believe that the substantially lower price of these products is the primary basis upon which they will compete with our moissanite jewels; however, they are not considered fine jewelry products.
 
Competing in the finished jewelry space
 
The global fine jewelry market competition is fierce. Such well-known jewelry designers and manufacturers as David Yurman, Tacori, Harry Winston, Tiffany & Co., and Pandora, among others, have a variety of jewelry collections featuring diamond and other precious and semi-precious gemstones, and enjoy strong brand recognition and a loyal consumer following. These companies also have greater financial resources than we do to develop and market their products.
 
We intend to expand our market share and compete with these well-known brands primarily on the basis of the combination of quality, design, and value, as moissanite is the highest quality, affordable alternative available to more expensive gemstones such as diamond. We believe that focusing on the clear advantages in moissanite’s retail price points, especially in the one-carat and larger sizes, will provide a key point of differentiation and value proposition to the end consumer who may not have had the opportunity to previously purchase fine jewelry due to limitations in discretionary spending income.
 
In addition, we believe that the Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® brand, in addition to other brands for both moissanite jewels, including Forever OneTM, and moissanite finished jewelry that we are developing pursuant to our marketing programs, may create a long-term competitive advantage for our products as we build brand recognition. We endeavor to partner with recognized designers and jewelry companies, in addition to developing our own proprietary brands of finished jewelry. While our finished jewelry business is still developing, our goal is to build multiple strong brands sought after by the end consumer. We propose to focus our marketing efforts on emphasizing our attractive designs, coupled with moissanite’s exceptional brilliance, fire, durability, and rarity, to establish moissanite as a primary consumer choice in fine jewelry.
 
Our design, manufacture and marketing of finished jewelry featuring moissanite under exclusive brands for sale at wholesale pricing to distributors and retailers and at retail to end consumers through our charlesandcolvard.com and other online channel outlets may result in some of our current wholesale customers perceiving us as a competitor, despite our efforts to use primarily non-conflicting sales channels. As we continue to develop our finished jewelry business, we intend to increase distribution through new and existing channels similarly to how many other companies have executed cross-channel marketing and distribution strategies. Due to the size of the finished jewelry market, we believe that such sales channels can co-exist, with the overall end result being increased consumer and brand awareness of moissanite products and a corresponding increased demand for not only our products, but those of our distributor and manufacturer customers as well.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to governmental regulations in the manufacture and sale of moissanite jewels and finished jewelry. In particular, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has issued regulations and guidelines governing the marketing of synthetic gemstones and other gemstones similar to diamond that require such gemstones to be clearly identified in any promotional or marketing materials. In addition, the precious metal in our finished jewelry may be subject to requirements, which vary by country and by state, such as hallmarking and alloy content. While we have a policy to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, if our actions are found to be in violation of FTC or other governmental regulations, we may be required to suspend marketing of our products and could incur significant expenses in developing new marketing strategies and materials that would not violate FTC regulations.
 
 15
 

Research and Development
 
We invested approximately $3,700 in research and development during 2017 compared to $2,800 in 2016 primarily for the study of product enhancement and manufacturing process efficiencies.
 
Employees
 
As of March 5, 2018, we had a total of 76 employees, 69 of whom were full-time and seven of whom were part-time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our employee relations are good.
