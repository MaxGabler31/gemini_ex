Previous Organizational Structure
We were initially formed in 2015 as part of a reorganization involving entities that were previously controlled by Tallgrass Equity to effect the TGE IPO. As of the closing of the TGE IPO in May 2015, our sole cash-generating asset was a controlling membership interest in Tallgrass Equity and Tallgrass Equity's sole cash-generating assets consisted of direct and indirect partnership interests in TEP, which was a publicly traded limited partnership at the time. 
Prior to the February 2018 merger discussed below, Tallgrass Energy Holdings was the general partner of Tallgrass Development. Historically, TEP acquired a number of its assets from Tallgrass Development. In connection with TEP's initial public offering in May 2013 (the "TEP IPO"), Tallgrass Development contributed to TEP 100% of the membership interests in TIGT and TMID. Following the TEP IPO, TEP acquired the following additional assets from Tallgrass Development: (1) in April 2014, a 100% membership interest in Trailblazer, (2) in four separate transactions, the most recent of which was effective on February 1, 2018, a 100% membership interest in Pony Express, (3) in January 2017, a 100% membership interest in NatGas and Terminals, (4) in March 2017, a 24.99% membership interest in Rockies Express, and (5) effective February 1, 2018, a 100% membership interest in Tallgrass Operations, LLC, which primarily owned certain administrative assets consisting primarily of information technology assets. In addition, in May 2016 Tallgrass Development assigned to TEP its right to purchase a 25% membership interest in Rockies Express from a unit of Sempra U.S. Gas and Power ("Sempra") pursuant to the purchase agreement originally entered into between Tallgrass Development's wholly-owned subsidiary and Sempra in March 2016. 
On February 7, 2018, Tallgrass Development merged into Tallgrass Development Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tallgrass Equity, and as a result of the merger, Tallgrass Equity acquired a 25.01% membership interest in Rockies Express and an additional 5,619,218 TEP common units. As consideration for the acquisition, TGE and Tallgrass Equity issued 27,554,785 TGE Class B shares and Tallgrass Equity units, valued at approximately $644.8 million based on the closing price on February 6, 2018, to the limited partners of Tallgrass Development. 
On March 26, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Tallgrass Equity, Tallgrass MLP GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of TEP ("TEP GP"), and Razor Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The merger transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the "TEP Merger") was completed effective June 30, 2018, and as a result, 47,693,097 TEP common units held by the public were converted into the right to receive Class A shares of TGE at an exchange ratio of 2.0 Class A shares for each outstanding TEP common unit, TEP's incentive distribution rights were cancelled, TEP's common units ceased being publicly traded, and 100% of TEP's equity interests are now owned by Tallgrass Equity and its subsidiaries.

Growth Projects
Our extensive asset base and our relationships with customers provide us with opportunities for internal growth through the construction of additional assets that are complementary to, and expand or extend, our existing asset base. The following growth projects are currently ongoing and will extend throughout 2019 and beyond: 

• | Iron Horse Pipeline. Iron Horse Pipeline, an approximately 80-mile crude oil pipeline currently under construction, will have an initial capacity of approximately 100,000 barrels per day, expandable up to 200,000 barrels per day, to transport crude oil from the Powder River Basin to the Guernsey, Wyoming oil hub and is expected to be in-service in the second quarter of 2019. As discussed above, the Iron Horse Pipeline is part of the Powder River Gateway joint venture.


• | Grasslands Terminal. We are currently constructing the Grasslands Terminal in Platteville, Colorado, which will connect to the Platteville Extension and enable Pony Express to batch multiple common streams out of Platteville. The Grasslands Terminal is expected to be in-service by the second quarter of 2019.


• | Cheyenne Connector. We are currently constructing the Cheyenne Connector, a new pipeline lateral in Northeast Colorado that will transport natural gas from the DJ Basin in Weld County to the Rockies Express Pipeline's Cheyenne Hub, discussed below. Cheyenne Connector will be a large-diameter pipeline approximately 70 miles long, with an initial capacity of at least 600 mmcf/d and significant capability for expansion. Cheyenne Connector is expected to be in-service in the fourth quarter of 2019.


• | Cheyenne Hub. The Rockies Express Pipeline's Cheyenne Hub is an existing natural gas facility owned and operated by Rockies Express Pipeline in northern Weld County. At the Cheyenne Hub, the existing Rockies Express Pipeline intersects and/or connects with numerous other natural gas pipelines. The Cheyenne Hub Enhancement Project consists of modifications to the Rockies Express Pipeline's Cheyenne Hub to accommodate firm receipt and delivery interconnectivity among multiple natural gas pipelines with various operating pressures and will provide customers significant diversity in terms of market access. Cheyenne Hub is expected to be in-service by the fourth quarter of 2019.


• | Plaquemines Liquids Terminal. In November 2018, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Drexel Hamilton Infrastructure Fund I, L.P. ("DHIF") to jointly-own Plaquemines Liquids Terminal, LLC ("PLT"). We made an initial cash contribution of $30.7 million in exchange for a 100% preferred membership interest and a 80% common membership interest. DHIF contributed any and all assets and rights related to the project in exchange for a 20% common membership interest and the right to receive certain special distributions. PLT will construct a liquid export terminal facility on the Mississippi River on an approximately 600-acre site in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. The site was acquired in November 2018 pursuant to an agreement between PLT and the Plaquemines Port & Harbor Terminal District. The facility is expected to offer up to 20 million barrels of storage for both crude oil and refined products and export facilities capable of loading Suezmax and Very Large Crude Carriers ("VLCC") vessels for international delivery. The project is currently expected to be in-service in 2020.

Competition
All of our businesses face strong competition for acquisitions and development of new projects from both established and start-up companies. Competition may increase the cost to acquire existing facilities or businesses and may result in fewer commitments and lower returns for new pipelines or other development projects. Our competitors may have greater financial resources than we possess or may be willing to accept lower returns or greater risks. Competition differs by region and by the nature of the business or the project involved.
Additionally, pending and future construction projects, if and when brought online, may also compete with our natural gas transportation, storage, gathering and processing services, crude oil transportation, storage, gathering and terminalling services, and water transportation, gathering, recycling and disposal services. Further, natural gas as a fuel, and fuels derived from crude oil, compete with other forms of energy available to users, including electricity, coal, other liquid fuels and alternative energy. Increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas or fuels derived from crude oil could lead to a reduction in demand for our services. Moreover, several other factors may influence the demand for natural gas and crude oil which in turn influences the demand for our services, including price changes, the availability of natural gas and crude oil and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation and governmental regulations, weather, and the ability to convert to alternative fuels.
Our principal competitors in our natural gas transportation and storage business include companies that own major natural gas pipelines, such as Enbridge Inc., Kinder Morgan Inc., Northern Natural Gas Company, Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc., Energy Transfer LP, and The Williams Companies Inc., some of whom also have existing storage facilities connected to their transportation systems that compete with our storage facilities.
Pony Express encounters competition in the crude oil transportation business. A number of pipeline companies compete with Pony Express to service takeaway volumes in markets that Pony Express currently serves, including pipelines owned and operated by Sinclair Oil Corporation, Plains All American Pipeline, L.P., Suncor Energy Inc., SemGroup Corporation, Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P., Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, NGL Energy Partners LP, Energy Transfer LP, and Enbridge Inc. Pony Express also competes with rail facilities, which can provide more delivery optionality to crude oil producers and marketers looking to capitalize on basis differentials between two primary crude oil price benchmarks (West Texas Intermediate Crude and Brent Crude), and with refineries that source barrels in areas served by Pony Express.
We also experience competition in the natural gas processing business. Our principal competitors for processing business include other facilities that service its supply areas, such as the other regional processing and treating facilities in the greater Powder River Basin which include plants owned and operated by Kinder Morgan, Inc., ONEOK, Inc., Western Gas Partners, LP, The Williams Companies Inc., and Meritage Midstream Services II, LLC. In addition, due to the competitive nature of the liquids-rich plays in the Wind River Basin and Powder River Basin, it is possible that one of our competitors could build additional processing facilities that service our supply areas. In addition, Terminals encounters competition in the crude oil storage and terminalling business from facilities owned by Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P., NGL Energy Partners LP, Plains All American, L.P., Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P., SemGroup Corporation, and Enbridge Inc. Further, we experience competition in the water business services. Our principal competitors in such business are other midstream companies, such as NGL Energy Partners LP, who compete with Water Solutions in areas of concentrated production activity.
Regulatory Environment 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
We provide open-access interstate transportation service on our natural gas transportation systems pursuant to tariffs approved by the FERC. As interstate transportation and storage systems, the rates, terms of service and continued operations of the Rockies Express Pipeline, the TIGT System and the Trailblazer Pipeline are subject to regulation by the FERC, under among other statutes, the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or NGA, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or the NGPA, and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, or EPAct 2005. The rates and terms of service on the Pony Express System, PRE Pipeline, and Iron Horse Pipeline are subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, or the ICA, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992. We provide interstate transportation service on the Pony Express System and PRE Pipeline pursuant to tariffs on file with the FERC. Our NGL pipeline that interconnects with Overland Pass Pipeline is leased to a third party who has obtained a waiver for itself from the FERC from the tariff, filing and reporting requirements of the ICA, and our NGL pipeline that interconnects with ONEOK's Bakken NGL Pipeline is leased to a third party who is obligated to operate the leased pipeline in conformance with the ICA as a FERC regulated NGL pipeline.

The FERC has jurisdiction over, among other things, the construction, ownership and commercial operation of pipelines and related facilities used in the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the modification, extension, enlargement and abandonment of such facilities. The FERC also has jurisdiction over the rates, charges and terms and conditions of service for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. The FERC's authority over interstate crude oil pipelines is less broad than its authority over interstate natural gas pipelines and includes rates, rules and regulations for service, the form of tariffs governing service, the maintenance of accounts and records, and depreciation and amortization policies.
The rates and terms for access to interstate natural gas pipeline transportation services are subject to extensive regulation and the FERC has undertaken various initiatives to increase competition within the natural gas industry. As a result of these initiatives, interstate natural gas transportation and marketing entities have been substantially restructured to remove barriers and practices that historically limited non-pipeline natural gas sellers, including producers, from competing effectively with interstate pipelines for sales to local distribution companies and large industrial and commercial customers. The FERC's regulations require, among other things, that interstate natural gas pipelines provide firm and interruptible transportation service on an open access basis, provide internet access to current information about available pipeline capacity and other relevant information, and permit pipeline shippers under certain circumstances to release contracted transportation and storage capacity to other shippers, thereby creating secondary markets for such services. The result of the FERC's initiatives has been to eliminate interstate natural gas pipelines' historical role of providing bundled sales service of natural gas and to require pipelines to offer unbundled storage and transportation services on a not unduly discriminatory or preferential basis. The rates for such transportation and storage services are subject to the FERC's ratemaking authority, and the FERC exercises its authority by applying cost-of-service principles to limit the maximum and minimum levels of tariff-based recourse rates; however, it also allows for discounted or negotiated rates as an alternative to cost-based rates and may grant market-based rates in certain circumstances. The FERC regulations also restrict interstate natural gas pipelines from sharing certain transportation or customer information with marketing affiliates and require that the transmission function personnel of interstate natural gas pipelines operate independently of the marketing function personnel of the pipeline or its affiliates.
FERC; Market Behavior Rules; Posting and Reporting Requirement; Other Enforcement Authorities
EPAct 2005, among other matters, amended the NGA to add an anti-manipulation provision that makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior in contravention of rules and regulations to be prescribed by the FERC and, furthermore, provides the FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The FERC adopted rules implementing the anti-manipulation provision of EPAct 2005 that make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person.
These anti-manipulation rules apply to interstate gas pipelines and storage companies and intrastate gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted "in connection with" gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. EPAct 2005 also amended the NGA and the NGPA to give the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes of more than $1 million per day per violation. In connection with this enhanced civil penalty authority, the FERC issued policy statements on enforcement to provide guidance regarding the enforcement of the statutes, orders, rules and regulations it administers, including factors to be considered in determining the appropriate enforcement action to be taken. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rule, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines, including the disgorgement of unjust profits.
EPAct 2005 also amended the NGA to authorize the FERC to facilitate price transparency in markets for the sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce. The FERC has taken steps to enhance its market oversight and monitoring of the natural gas industry by adopting rules that (1) require buyers and sellers of annual quantities of 2,200,000 MMBtu or more of gas in any year to report by May on the aggregate volumes of natural gas they purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year; (2) report whether they provide prices to any index publishers and, if so, whether their reporting complies with the FERC's policy statement on price reporting; and (3) increase the internet posting obligations of interstate pipelines.
In addition, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, is directed under the Commodities Exchange Act, or CEA, to prevent price manipulations for the commodity and futures markets, including the energy futures markets. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act, in July 2010 and other authority, the CFTC has adopted anti-market manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. The CFTC also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of more than $1 million or triple the monetary gain to the violator for violations of the anti-market manipulation sections of the CEA.
13

Further, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has the authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTCA, and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, or EISA, to regulate wholesale petroleum markets. The FTC has adopted anti-market manipulation rules, including prohibiting fraud and deceit in connection with the purchase or sale of certain petroleum products, and prohibiting omissions of material information which distort or are likely to distort market conditions for such products. In addition to other enforcement powers it has under the FTCA, the FTC can sue violators under EISA and request that a court impose fines of more than $1 million per violation per day. 
The FERC also has the authority under the ICA to regulate the interstate transportation of petroleum on common carrier pipelines, including whether a pipeline's rates or rules and regulations for service are "just and reasonable." Among other enforcement powers, the FERC can order prospective rate changes, suspend the effectiveness of rates, and order reparations for damages. In addition, the ICA imposes potential criminal liability for certain violations of the statute. 
Certain Outstanding Notices Issued by the FERC
FERC Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Revisions to Indexing Policies and Page 700 of FERC Form No. 6, Docket No. RM17-1-000
On November 2, 2016, the FERC issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, under which the FERC is proposing changes to its regulation of oil pipelines in two different areas: (1) its policies regarding the permissible scope of rate increases based on its annual issuance of changes to the generic oil pipeline index, based on specific pipelines' earnings or their specific changes to costs; and (2) the reporting requirements for page 700 of FERC Form No. 6, Annual Report of Oil Pipeline Companies. The FERC's Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking does not propose specific regulations, and may be followed by a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing specific regulations or a Policy Statement announcing new or changed policies. Comments have been filed with the FERC by interested parties and the proceeding is pending before the FERC.
Notice of Inquiry on FERC's Pipeline Certificate Policy Statement, PL18-1-000
On April 19, 2018, the FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry regarding whether it should revise its current policy statement on its review and authorization of natural gas pipelines under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act. The current policy statement, "Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities - Statement of Policy," was issued in 1999. The Notice of Inquiry requested comments in four general areas: (1) the reliance on precedent agreements to demonstrate need for a proposed project; (2) the potential exercise of eminent domain and landowner interests; (3) the FERC's evaluation of alternatives and environmental effects under the National Environmental Policy Act and the Natural Gas Act; and (4) the efficiency and effectiveness of the FERC's certificate processes. Comments have been filed by interested parties and the proceeding is pending before the FERC.
Examples of Our Dockets at the FERC
Trailblazer 2018 General Rate Case Filing
On June 29, 2018, Trailblazer filed a general rate case with the FERC proposing, among other things, an increase in rates on Trailblazer's Existing System Firm Transportation Service and a decrease in rates for Expansion System Firm Transportation Service and interruptible services. On July 31, 2018, the FERC issued an Order: (1) approving the as-filed rate decreases for Expansion System Firm Transportation Service and interruptible services, effective August 1, 2018; (2) accepting and suspending the rest of the rate case filing (including the proposed rate increases) to become effective January 1, 2019 subject to refund, and establishing hearing and settlement procedures; and (3) establishing a paper hearing to examine the extent to which Trailblazer is entitled to an Income Tax Allowance. Parties have submitted briefs on the Income Tax Allowance issue and the paper hearing remains pending before the FERC. The remaining issues are currently subject to settlement judge procedures.
Cheyenne Hub Enhancement Project
On March 2, 2018, Rockies Express submitted an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the NGA for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of certain booster compressor units and ancillary facilities located at the Cheyenne Hub in Weld County, Colorado that will enable Rockies Express to provide a new hub service allowing for firm receipts and deliveries between Rockies Express and certain other interconnected pipelines at the Cheyenne Hub. Rockies Express filed this certificate application in conjunction with a concurrently filed certificate application by Cheyenne Connector, LLC ("Cheyenne Connector") for the Cheyenne Connector Pipeline Project further described below. The comment period for the Cheyenne Hub Enhancement Project closed on April 9, 2018. To date, various comments have been filed by market participants and others regarding the proposed project. Rockies Express has also responded to data requests from the FERC's relevant program offices. On October 11, 2018, the FERC issued a Notice of Schedule of Environmental Review setting December 18, 2018 as the date of issuance of the Environmental Assessment and March 18, 2019 as the deadline for decisions by other federal agencies on requests for authorizations for the proposed project. On December 18, 2018, the FERC issued the Environmental Assessment.

Cheyenne Connector Pipeline Project
On March 2, 2018, Cheyenne Connector, an indirect subsidiary of TGE, submitted an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the NGA for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct and operate a 70-mile, 36-inch pipeline to transport natural gas from multiple gas processing plants in Weld County, Colorado to Rockies Express' Cheyenne Hub. The comment period for the Cheyenne Connector Pipeline Project closed on April 9, 2018. To date, various comments have been filed by market participants and others regarding the proposed project. Cheyenne Connector has also responded to data requests from the FERC's relevant program offices. On October 11, 2018, the FERC issued a Notice of Schedule of Environmental Review setting December 18, 2018 as the date of issuance of the Environmental Assessment and March 18, 2019 as the deadline for decisions by other federal agencies on requests for authorizations for the proposed project. On December 18, 2018, the FERC issued the Environmental Assessment.

Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
We are also subject to safety regulations imposed by PHMSA, including those regulations requiring us to develop and maintain integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in areas, which are referred to as high consequence areas, or HCAs, where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm.
In January 2012, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, or The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011, which amended the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, increased penalties for violations of safety laws and rules, among other matters, and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations in the next few years. This legislation also requires the U.S. Department of Transportation to study and report to Congress on other areas of pipeline safety, including expanding the reach of the integrity management regulations beyond high consequence areas, but restricts the U.S. Department of Transportation from promulgating expanded integrity management rules during the review period and for a period following submission of its report to Congress unless the rulemaking is needed to address a present condition that poses a risk to public safety, property or the environment. PHMSA issued a final rule effective October 25, 2013 that implemented aspects of the new legislation. Among other things, the final rule increases the maximum civil penalties for violations of pipeline safety statutes or regulations, broadens PHMSA's authority to submit information requests, and provides additional detail regarding PHMSA's corrective action authority. In addition, the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016, or PIPES Act, reauthorized PHMSA's oil and gas pipeline programs through 2019 and gave PHMSA power to issue emergency orders upon finding an imminent hazard, required PHMSA to issue safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities, set deadlines for conducting post-inspection briefings and making findings, required liquid pipeline operators to undertake new safety measures, and required certain updates to the PHMSA website.
Additionally, PHMSA is also currently considering changes to its regulations. On December 14, 2016, PHMSA issued an interim final rule, or IFR, that addresses safety issues related to downhole facilities, including well integrity, well bore tubing, and casing at underground natural gas storage facilities. The IFR incorporates by reference two of the American Petroleum Institute's Recommended Practice standards and mandates certain reporting requirements for operators of underground natural gas storage facilities. Operators of natural gas storage facilities were given one year from January 18, 2017, the effective date of the IFR, to implement this first set of PHMSA regulations governing underground storage fields. PHMSA determined, however, that it will not issue enforcement citations to any operators for violations of provisions of the IFR that had previously been non-mandatory provisions of American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practices 1170 and 1171 until one year after PHMSA issues a final rule. On January 13, 2017, PHMSA finalized new hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations. Among other things, the final rule would have required additional event-driven and periodic inspections, required the use of leak detection systems on all hazardous liquid pipelines, modified repair criteria, and required certain pipelines to eventually accommodate in-line inspection tools. However, on January 24, 2017, this rule was withdrawn for further review by the Trump Administration and was never published in the Federal Register. 
Also, on April 8, 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rule-making, or NPRM, addressing natural gas transmission and gathering lines. The proposed rule would include changes to existing integrity management requirements and would expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population densities (referred to as Moderate Consequence Areas or MCAs), along with other changes. This NPRM builds on an Advisory Bulletin PHMSA issued in May 2012, which advised pipeline operators of anticipated changes in annual reporting requirements and that if they are relying on design, construction, inspection, testing, or other data to determine the pressures at which their pipelines should operate, the records of that data must be traceable, verifiable and complete. Locating such records and, in the absence of any such records, verifying maximum pressures through physical testing (including hydrotesting) or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the demands of such pressures, could significantly increase our costs. TIGT continues to investigate and, when necessary, report to PHMSA the miles of pipeline for which it has incomplete records for maximum allowable operating pressure, or MAOP. We are currently 
15

undertaking an extensive internal record review in view of the anticipated PHMSA annual reporting requirements. Additionally, failure to locate such records or verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. At the state level, several states have passed legislation or promulgated rulemaking dealing with pipeline safety. There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. Regulations, changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting, the replacement of some of our pipeline segments, the addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures.
Pipeline Integrity Issues
The ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict. Changes such as advances of in-line inspection tools, identification of additional threats to a pipeline's integrity and changes to the amount of pipe determined to be located in HCAs or expansion of integrity management requirements to areas outside of HCAs can have a significant impact on the costs to perform integrity testing and repairs. In July 2018, PHMSA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the class location requirements for natural gas transmission pipelines, and particularly the actions operators must take when class locations change due to population growth or building construction near the pipeline. We will continue pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of its existing and future pipelines as required by the U.S. Department of Transportation regulations. The results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of its pipelines, which expenditures could be material.
From time to time, our pipelines may experience integrity issues. These integrity issues may cause explosions, fire, damage to the environment, damage to property and/or personal injury or death. In connection with these incidents, we may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of our pipelines and/or to properly maintain our pipelines. Depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident, state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil and/or criminal fines and penalties and we may also be subject to private civil liability for such matters. 
Trailblazer
Starting in 2014 Trailblazer's operating capacity was decreased as a result of smart tool surveys that identified approximately 25 - 35 miles of pipe as potentially requiring repair or replacement. During 2016 and 2017, Trailblazer incurred approximately $21.8 million of remediation costs to address this issue, including replacing approximately 8 miles of pipe. To date the pressure and capacity reduction has not prevented Trailblazer from fulfilling its firm service obligations at existing subscription levels or had a material adverse financial impact on us. However, Trailblazer continued performing remediation to increase and maximize its operating capacity over the long-term and spent approximately $21 million during 2018 for this pipe replacement and remediation work. As of October 2018, the pipeline was returned to its maximum allowable operating capacity. Trailblazer is exploring all possible cost recovery options to recover expenditures, including recovery through a general rate increase, negotiated rate agreements with its customers, or other FERC-approved recovery mechanisms.
In connection with TEP's acquisition of Trailblazer in April 2014, TD agreed to indemnify TEP for certain out of pocket costs related to repairing or remediating the Trailblazer Pipeline. The contractual indemnity was capped at $20 million and subject to an annual $1.5 million deductible. TEP has received the entirety of the $20 million from TD pursuant to the contractual indemnity as of December 31, 2017.
Pony Express
In connection with certain crack tool runs on the Pony Express System completed in 2015, 2016 and 2017, Pony Express completed approximately $18 million of remediation for anomalies identified on the Pony Express System associated with portions of the pipeline that were converted from natural gas to crude oil service. Remediation work was substantially complete as of March 1, 2018. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
General
The ownership, operation and expansion of our assets are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as restricting the way we can handle or dispose of our wastes, requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by our operations or that are attributable to former operations, regulating future construction activities to mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species, wetlands and migratory birds, and requiring the installation and operation of pollution control or seismic monitoring equipment. The cost of complying with these laws and regulations can be significant, and we expect to incur significant compliance costs in the future as new, more stringent requirements are adopted and implemented. 
16

Failure to comply with existing environmental laws, regulations, permits, approvals or authorizations or to meet the requirements of new environmental laws, regulations or permits, approvals and authorizations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties and/or temporary or permanent interruptions in our operations that could influence our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. The costs and liabilities resulting from a failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could negatively affect our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.
In addition, we have agreed to a number of conditions in our environmental permits, approvals and authorizations that require the implementation of environmental habitat restoration, enhancement and other mitigation measures that involve, among other things, ongoing maintenance and monitoring. Governmental authorities may require, and community groups and private persons may seek to require, additional mitigation measures in the future to further protect ecologically sensitive areas where we currently operate, and would operate in the future, and we are unable to predict the effect that any such measures would have on our business, financial position, results of operations or prospects.
We are also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, or OSHA, the Pipeline Safety Act and other comparable federal and state statutes. In general, we expect that it may have to increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards. Such increases in expenditures could become significant over time.
Historically, our total expenditures for environmental control measures and for remediation have not been significant in relation to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. It is reasonably likely, however, that the long-term trend in environmental legislation and regulations will eventually move towards more restrictive standards. Compliance with these standards is expected to increase the cost of conducting business.
For additional information regarding Environmental, Health and Safety Matters, please read Item 1A.—Risk Factors.
Air Emissions
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, or CAA, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including natural gas processing plants and compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions (including GHG emissions, as discussed below), obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and/or install emission control equipment. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment and technology in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.
The EPA finalized a rule, effective August 2, 2016, under the New Source Performance Standard Program, or NSPS Program, to limit methane emissions from the oil and gas and transmission sectors. The rule sets additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulates methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry. In October 2018, the EPA proposed a rule to reconsider and amend various requirements of the NSPS standard. However, the NSPS rule currently remains in effect. The EPA also finalized a rule effective August 2, 2016 regarding the alternative criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes. EPA draft guidance issued in September 2018 clarified that this rule pertains to the oil and gas industry. Also, effective January 17, 2017, the Bureau of Land Management of the U.S. Department of the Interior, or BLM, imposed new rules to reduce venting, flaring and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian lands. This rule was suspended, stayed, and reinstated before the BLM issued a final rule in September 2018 that rescinds and revises many of the requirements of the 2017 rule. The revision rule is being challenged in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California but currently remains in effect.
Developments in GHG Regulations
Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas and products produced from crude oil, are examples of GHGs. The EPA has determined that the emission of GHGs presents an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases contribute to the warming of the Earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. Various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of such GHGs, including the EPA programs to control GHG emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs. In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. There have also been efforts to regulate GHGs at an international level, most recently in the Paris Agreement, which 
17

was signed on April 22, 2016 by 175 countries, including the United States. The Paris Agreement will require countries to review and "represent a progression" in their intended, nationally-determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. However, in August of 2017, the United States informed the United Nations of its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The earliest possible effective withdrawal date from the Paris Agreement is November 2020. 
Because our operations, including our compressor stations, emit various types of GHGs, primarily methane and carbon dioxide, such new legislation or regulation could increase our costs related to operating and maintaining our facilities. Depending on the particular new law, regulation or program adopted, we could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new emission controls on our facilities, acquire permits or other authorizations for emissions of GHGs from our facilities, acquire and surrender allowances for our GHG emissions, pay taxes related to our GHG emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program. We are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs; however, as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry, they could be significant to us. While we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our pipelines, such recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond our control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations. Similarly, while we may be able to recover some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our processing facilities, such recovery of costs is uncertain and may depend on the terms of our contracts with our customers. In addition, new laws, regulations, or programs adopted could also impact our customers' operations or the overall demand for fossil fuels. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.
Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing
A sizeable portion of the hydrocarbons we transport, process, and store comes from hydraulically fractured wells. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process typically involves the injection of water, sand and a small percentage of chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is regulated by state agencies, typically the state's oil and gas commission; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, and has released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where the EPA is the permitting authority. A number of federal agencies, including the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy, are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. In addition, some states, including those in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Other states, including states in which we operate, have restrictions on produced water storage from hydraulic fracturing operations and the operation of produced water disposal wells. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, and in some cases, may seek to ban hydraulic fracturing entirely. Some state and local authorities have considered or imposed new laws and rules related to hydraulic fracturing, including temporary or permanent bans, additional permit requirements, operational restrictions and chemical disclosure obligations on hydraulic fracturing in certain jurisdictions or in environmentally sensitive areas. 
 If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the volume of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that our customers produce, and could thereby adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, nonhazardous and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or analogous state laws, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released or threatened to be released into the environment.
18

We also generate wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state laws. RCRA regulates both nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes, but it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. It is possible that wastes resulting from our operations that are currently treated as non-hazardous wastes could be designated as "hazardous wastes" in the future, subjecting us to more rigorous and costly management and disposal requirements. It is also possible that federal or state regulatory agencies will adopt stricter management or disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including natural gas wastes. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects or otherwise impose limits or restrictions on our operations or those of our customers.
In some cases, we own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal. We could also have liability for releases or disposal on properties owned or leased by others. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners and operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.
Our produced water disposal operations require it to comply with the Class II well standards under the federal SDWA. The SDWA imposes requirements on owners and operators of Class II wells through the EPA's Underground Injection Control program, including construction, operating, monitoring and testing, reporting and closure requirements. Our disposal wells are also subject to comparable state laws and regulations. Compliance with current and future laws and regulations regarding our produced water disposal wells may impose substantial costs and restrictions on our produced water disposal operations, as well as adversely affect demand for our produced water disposal services. State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of produced water injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity and tremors. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In some instances, operators of produced water injection wells in the vicinity of minor seismic events have been ordered to reduce produced water injection volumes or suspend operations. Regulatory agencies are continuing to study possible linkage between produced water injection activity and induced seismicity. These developments could result in additional regulation of produced water injection wells, such regulations could impose additional costs and restrictions on our produced water disposal operations.
Federal and State Waters
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, or the CWA, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including petroleum products, into state waters or waters of the United States. In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers adopted a rule to clarify the meaning of the term "waters of the United States" with respect to federal jurisdiction. Many interested parties believe that the rule expands federal jurisdiction under the CWA. This rule was initially challenged in federal courts at both the appellate and district court levels. It was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit but, based on a January 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision determining that only the district courts have jurisdiction to hear the challenges, the Sixth Circuit stay was withdrawn. Some federal district courts have enjoined the rule, but the rule is currently effective in over 20 states. In February 2018, the agencies also published a final rule adding a February 6, 2020 applicability date to the 2015 rule, but this rule was enjoined nationwide in August 2018. In December 2018, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers released a proposed rule to redefine the extent of CWA jurisdiction. If finalized, this rule would replace the 2015 rule defining "waters of the United States" and the scope of federal jurisdiction. 
Regulations promulgated pursuant to the CWA and analogous state laws require that entities that discharge into federal and/or state waters obtain National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, permits and/or state permits authorizing these discharges. The CWA and analogous state laws assess administrative, civil and criminal penalties for discharges of unauthorized pollutants into the water and impose substantial liability for the costs of removing spills from such waters. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require that individual permits or coverage under general permits be obtained by covered facilities for discharges of storm water runoff. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the CWA permitting requirements as well as the conditions imposed thereunder and that continued compliance with such existing permit conditions will not have a material effect on our results of operations. 
The primary federal law related to oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the CWA and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain "responsible parties" related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters or adjoining shorelines. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws and analogous state laws require us to maintain spill prevention control and countermeasure plans. These laws also require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. Regulations promulgated pursuant to OPA further require certain facilities to maintain oil spill prevention and oil spill contingency plans. A liable

"responsible party" includes the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge, or in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. OPA assigns joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In the event of an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge, we may be liable for costs and damages.
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act, or ESA, restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unlisted endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans or limit future development in the affected areas.
National Environmental Policy Act
The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, establishes a national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within federal agencies. A major federal agency action having the potential to significantly impact the environment requires review under NEPA and, as a result, many activities requiring FERC or other federal approval must undergo a NEPA review. A NEPA review can create delays and increased costs that could materially adversely affect our operations.
Employee Safety
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
Seasonality
Weather generally impacts natural gas demand for power generation, heating purposes and other natural gas usages, which in turn influences the value of transportation and storage. Price volatility also affects gas prices, which in turn influences drilling and production. Peak demand for natural gas typically occurs during the winter months, caused by heating demand. Nevertheless, because a high percentage of our natural gas transportation and storage and crude oil transportation revenues are derived from firm capacity reservation fees under long-term firm fee contracts, our revenues attributable to those segments are not generally seasonal in nature. We experience some seasonality in our processing segment, as volumes at our processing facilities are slightly higher in the summer months. We also experience some seasonality in our maintenance, repair, overhaul, integrity, and other projects, as warm weather months are most conducive to efficient execution of these activities.
Title to Properties and Rights-of-Way
Our real property generally falls into two categories: (i) parcels that we own in fee and (ii) parcels in which our interest derives from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, surface use agreements, or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations. We believe that we have satisfactory title to the material portions of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are owned by us in fee title. The remainder of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located are held by us pursuant primarily to leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, surface use agreements or licenses between us, as grantee, and a third party, as grantor. We believe that we have satisfactory rights to all of the material parcels in which our interest derives from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, surface use agreements, and licenses.
Insurance
We generally share insurance coverage with Tallgrass Energy Holdings pursuant to the terms of the TGE Omnibus Agreement and an Omnibus Agreement dated May 17, 2013 entered into among TEP, TEP GP, Tallgrass Development and the general partner of Tallgrass Development (the "TEP Omnibus Agreement"). This shared insurance program includes general and excess liability insurance, auto liability insurance, workers' compensation insurance, pollution, business interruption and property and director and officer liability insurance. All insurance coverage is in amounts which management believes are reasonable and appropriate.

Employees
We are managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner. As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 750 full-time employees through Tallgrass Management, LLC ("Tallgrass Management"). Prior to July 1, 2018, Tallgrass Management was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tallgrass Energy Holdings. Effective July 1, 2018, Tallgrass Management was contributed to Tallgrass Equity in connection with the TEP Merger. As a result, the costs of employer and director compensation and benefits are now incurred directly by Tallgrass Equity.
Under the terms of the TGE Omnibus Agreement, the TEP Omnibus Agreement and our partnership agreement, we reimburse Tallgrass Energy Holdings (and its affiliates) and our general partner, respectively, for the provision of various general and administrative services for our benefit and for direct expenses incurred by Tallgrass Energy Holdings (and its affiliates) or our general partner on our behalf, including services performed and expenses incurred by our executive management personnel in connection with our business and affairs.
