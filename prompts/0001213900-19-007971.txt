Introduction
 
Unless otherwise noted, references in this registration statement to the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” means Yew Bio-Pharm Group, Inc. (individually, “YBP”), a Nevada corporation; its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Yew Bio-Pharm Holdings Limited (individually, “Yew HK”), a corporation organized under the laws of Hong Kong, and Heilongjiang Jinshangjing Bio-Technology Development Co., Limited (individually, “JSJ”), a corporation organized in the People’s Republic of China, (“China” or the “PRC”); and a deemed variable interest entity, or VIE, Harbin Yew Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd. (individually, “HDS”), a corporation organized in the PRC, Harbin Yew Food Co. Ltd. (individually, “HYF”), the subsidiary of HDS, a corporation organized in the PRC, and MC Commerce Holding Inc. (individually, “MC”), a California corporation.
 
We are a major grower and seller of yew trees and manufacturer of products made from yew trees in China. We also sell raw material, including the branches and leaves of yew trees, used in the manufacture of TCM. The yew raw material contains taxol, and TCM containing yew raw material has been approved in the PRC for use as a secondary treatment of certain cancers, meaning it must be administered in combination with other pharmaceutical drugs. The yew industry is regulated in the PRC because the yew tree is considered an endangered species. 
 
We believe that our business is built upon five unique components:
 

● | We have entered into several land use agreements with various parties, which provide the potential for us to grow a large number of yew trees on large areas of land over the next few decades, although we cannot currently estimate the number of trees we will grow or the total amount of land we will put into production over such period. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We employ proprietary, patented accelerated growth technology, the Asexual Reproduction Method, to bring yew trees to commercialization decades faster than growing yew trees naturally. 
● | Because of our more productive and faster rate of yew cultivation, we have a sufficient supply of raw material to allow us to use the branches and leaves, rather than the bark, of yew trees, to sell to customers for the purpose of making TCM. The yew industry is highly regulated in the PRC because the yew tree is considered an endangered species. By harvesting only branches and leaves of yew trees we respond to both environmental sensitivities and regulations, because cutting the bark of the yew trees will damage the trees and stop it from growing new branches. 
● | We have permits from the Heilongjiang provincial government to sell our yew trees and manufacture handicrafts using yew timber. We believe that we are one of only a handful of companies in the PRC with permissions to manufacture handicrafts using yew timber. 
● | The TCM raw materials and yew tree segments of our business are tax-free in the PRC. 

 
Using patented accelerated growth technology developed by our founder and President, Zhiguo Wang, based on principles of asexual propagation and cloning, we can bring yew trees to maturity and commercialize them in as little as two-to-three years, compared to more than 50 years needed for naturally grown yew trees. Additionally, we have permits from the Heilongjiang provincial government to sell our yew trees and products made from yew trees. We believe that we are one of only a few companies in the PRC with such permission.
 
We operate in four business segments: TCM raw materials, yew trees, handicrafts and others. We sell TCM raw materials in the form of yew tree branches and leaves to our customers, primarily an affiliate, to manufacture TCM containing taxol. We began the TCM raw materials segment in 2010. 
 
In December 2009, another company owned directly and indirectly primarily by Mr. Wang, Heilongjiang Yew Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Yew Pharmaceutical, received approval from the Heilongjiang Food and Drug Agency, or HFDA, to sell Zi Shan , a TCM to be sold under both prescription and over-the-counter drug categories. Zi Shan contains taxol, and the TCM is approved in the PRC as a secondary treatment of cancer, meaning it must be administered in combination with other pharmaceutical drugs. In February 2010, we began selling to Yew Pharmaceutical branches and leaves of yew trees, which is more environmentally responsible than using the bark of yew trees, to extract taxol.

We also derive revenue from the sale of yew seedlings and trees to state-owned enterprises and private businesses for reforestation in Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province, in the northeastern China, as well as the sale of potted yew trees to retail customers. We also generate revenue from the sale of handicrafts, including furniture, made from yew timber. Additionally, we started to sell yew candles in the third quarter of 2015, and pine needle extracts in the fourth quarter of 2015. Most of our revenue is derived from the Chinese domestic market for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from the sale of TCM raw materials represented approximately 62.48% of consolidated revenue (all of consolidated revenues from a related party); sale of yew trees represented approximately 0.08% of consolidated revenue; sale of handicrafts represented approximately 0.05% of consolidated revenue; and the sale of the others, which include yew candles, yew essential oil soap and pine needle extracts, represented approximately 37.39% of consolidated revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from the sale of TCM raw materials represented approximately 49.78% of consolidated revenue (all of consolidated revenues from a related party); sale of yew trees represented approximately 0.02% of consolidated revenue; and the sale of handicrafts represented approximately 0.12% of consolidated revenue; and the sale of the others, which include yew candles and pine needle extracts, represented approximately 50.07%.
 
Under Article 27 of the Law of the PRC on Enterprises Income Tax and Article 15 of the provisional regulations of the PRC on Value Added Tax, we do not pay any tax, including income tax and value-added tax, or VAT, in our TCM raw materials and yew tree segments. Our current VAT exemption certificate was issued on December 8, 2016 and effective on the same day. Annual renewal is not required for the Company to continuously enjoy the VAT exemption, and our current income tax exemption certificate is valid from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2058. We pay taxes on handicrafts made from yew timber, wood ear mushroom, yew candle, yew essential oil soap and pine needle extracts.
 
Zhiguo Wang, the founder of the Company and our President, does not devote all of his time to the Company’s business. We estimate that Mr. Wang devotes approximately 71% of his time, or approximately 120 hours per month, to the Company’s business.
 
The executive offices of HDS, our operating entity, are located in Harbin City, the capital of Heilongjiang Province in the PRC. Our four nurseries used to cultivate yew trees, and our production facilities to manufacture products made from yew trees, are in and around Harbin. We also have a facility in Harbin where we exhibit and warehouse potted yew trees, handicrafts and furniture.
 
YBP was incorporated in Nevada on November 5, 2007. YBP’s current executive office is located at 9460 Telstar Avenue Suite 6, El Monte, CA 91731, and our telephone number is (626) 401-9588. Our website is www.yewbiopharm.com. No part of our website is incorporated into this registration statement or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Industry Overview
 
Since 1996, we have grown Japanese yew trees (also referred to in China as Northeast yew trees), taxus cuspidate , on mountain hillsides near Harbin and cultivate them in four nurseries we operate near Harbin. We have successfully cultivated more than eight million yew nursery seedlings in four nurseries. These nurseries occupy approximately 19,759 Mu (approximately 2,957 acres) of forested land. We currently have the capacity to grow up to two million yew nursery seedlings annually. We also have contractual rights to use an additional 1,000,000 Mu (approximately 166,667 acre) site in Wuchang, which land we currently do not utilize, for future expansion of our yew tree growing operations.
 
Northeast yew trees grow well in the climate of Northeast China. Using our patented Asexual Reproduction Method, developed by our founder and President, Zhiguo Wang, based on principles of asexual propagation and cloning, we can bring yew trees to maturity and commercialize them in as little as two-to-three years, compared to more than 50 years of maturity period for naturally grown yew trees. We believe that utilizing the Asexual Reproduction Method addresses an imbalance between supply and demand for yew trees, both for reforestation and use in the production of cancer-fighting TCM.
 
The Northeast yew is a small- to medium-sized evergreen tree, typically growing from between 35 and 65 feet tall, with a trunk up to 6-1/2 feet in diameter. The bark is thin and scaly brown. The leaves are lanceolate, flat and dark green, typically between 1/2 and 1-1/2 inches long and about 0.1 inches broad, arranged in a spiral pattern on the stem. The Northeast yew tree is relatively slow growing compared to other species of yew trees, but can be very long-lived. It is estimated that a Northeast yew tree can live up to 2,000 years. The growing cycle of a Northeast yew tree is extremely long and regeneration is difficult.
 
Yew trees are scarce and, traditionally, it takes a long time to bring them to commercialization. It can take more than 50 years for a yew tree to mature naturally for pharmaceutical use. Our Asexual Reproduction Method shortens this period significantly. We begin with cuttings from natural yew trees, which we transplant at our nurseries. By using our Asexual Reproduction Method, the success rate of maturation is enhanced and in approximately two-to-three years the yew tree is able to be used for commercialization. We use some trees in their entirety and parts of other yew trees that we need and take the rest of the tree itself back to the forest to finish full growth to maturity in 10-15 years, creating a new generation of mature yew trees.

Because the Northeast yew trees are categorized as an endangered species and are protected in the PRC as a Level 2 preserved tree, the operation of the yew industry in the PRC is strictly regulated by the PRC Forest Law and its Implementing Regulations, Rules on Permit for Felling of Forest Trees, Regulations on Wild Plants Protection and other PRC laws and regulations. The available sources for yew trees for commercialization are scarce and costs of production are relatively high.
 
In accordance with the Notification about Key Points of Forestry Policies from National Forestry Bureau Registered (2007) No.173, or the Notification, issued on August 10, 2007 jointly by the National Forestry Bureau, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Finance Ministry, the Commerce Department, the State Administration of Taxation, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, and China Security Regulatory Commission, the Chinese government encourages the development of technologies promoting the cultivation of rare trees and plant-based pharmaceuticals; encourages the cultivation of fast growing timber species, especially rare and large diameter timber; and accelerates the reorganization and integration of existing wood-based panels, furniture, wood products manufacturing enterprises. The Notification also provides that the forestry industry shall enjoy state preferential taxation policies. According to the provisions of the relevant tax laws and regulations on enterprises engaged in agriculture and forestry projects, the enterprise income tax can be reduced or eliminated.
 
The Ministry of Science and Technology of the PRC implemented the Spark Program, or the Spark Program, in 1986. The major task of the Spark Program is to rejuvenate the rural economy by relying on science and technology and popularizing advanced and applicable scientific and technological findings in the rural areas. To encourage the Spark Program, the Chinese government set up the National Spark Prize in 1987, including Spark Science and Technology Prize, Spark Talent Training Prize, Spark Management Prize, Spark Outstanding Youth Prize and Spark Demonstrating Enterprise Prize. In 2001 the project of cultivation of yew trees has been recognized by the Ministry of Science and Technology of PRC as the Spark Program.
 
We have entered into several land use agreements with various parties, which provide the potential for us to grow a large number of yew trees on approximately 1,017,713.5 mu (approximately 169,619 acres) over the next few decades, although we cannot currently estimate the total number of trees we will grow or the total amount of land we will put into production over such period. Among these land use agreements, on March 21, 2004, we entered into a Joint-Stock Construct Rare Plant Northeast Yew Contract, or the Joint Venture Agreement, with the Heilongjiang Province Wuchang City Forestry Bureau, or the Wuchang Forestry Bureau, pursuant to which the Wuchang Forestry Bureau has given us access to 1,000,000 mu (approximately 166,667 acres) of forest land located in Wuchang City to develop yew tree forests and produce yew seedlings. Pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement, we have permission to plant yew trees on this land from 2004 through 2034. Under the Joint Venture Agreement, any profits from the planting of yew trees and other agriculture shall be distributed 80% to the Company and 20% to the Wuchang Forestry Bureau. We have not yet cultivated this land or generated any revenue under the Joint Venture Agreement. Because of the profit-sharing feature of this agreement, we presently intend to focus on cultivating yew trees on other land subject to existing and possibly future land use agreements as our priority for at least the next few years.
 
Our business is sustainable and environmentally responsible. We accelerate the growth of yew trees utilizing our Asexual Reproduction Method, more than replenishing the number of yew trees we cultivate and put into production. We harvest yew trees twice a year. We do not use the bark of yew trees in production, which would kill the yew tree; instead, we use the branches and leaves of the yew tree.
 
Traditional Chinese Medicine
 
There is a long-established, scientifically recognized relationship between the Pacific yew, taxus brevifolia , and similar species of yew (including the Northeast yew), and certain cancer drugs, most notably paclitaxel, also known as taxol. Paclitaxel is a broad-spectrum mitotic inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy. It was discovered in a U.S. National Cancer Institute program at the Research Triangle Institute in 1967 when Monroe E. Wall and Mansukh C. Wani isolated it from the bark of the Pacific yew tree and named it taxol. Taxol is found in the root, stem, leaf, seed and bark of the taxus family of trees, including the Pacific and Northeast yews. It was developed commercially by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the brand name Taxol®. The PRC State Food and Drug Administration, or the SFDA, approved a new drug certification for taxol in 1995.
 
The improvement on the extraction and isolation technology of the biological properties of taxol made it a breakthrough in the treatment of cancer in the 1990s, providing a non-intrusive alternative to the more radical techniques of radiotherapy and surgery. Taxol is used to treat patients with lung, ovarian, breast, head and neck cancer, and advanced forms of Kaposi’s sarcoma.
 
Taxol, derived from certain species of yew tree including the Northeast yew tree, is a taxane drug and mitotic inhibitor that is used to treat cancer. All cells grow by a process called mitosis (cell division). Taxol targets rapidly growing cancer cells, sticks to them while they are trying to divide and prevents them from completing the division process. Since the cancer cells cannot divide into new cells, they cannot grow and the cancer cannot metastasize. Taxol may suppress tumor growth through regulating microtubule stabilization, inducing apoptosis and adjusting immunologic mechanism. Taxol can promote the polymerization of microtubule and inhibit their degradation, through which taxol can block cell division in the G2/M stage and induce apoptosis of tumor cells.

Taxol is a clear, colorless fluid that is given intravenously as a chemotherapy injection or as an infusion pumped from a dose bag. Taxol can be administered as high-dose chemotherapy, once every two or three weeks, or in low doses on a weekly basis. In the treatment of certain soft tissue cancers, such as breast cancer, taxol is given for early stage and metastatic breast cancer after combination anthracycline and cytoxan therapy and is also given as neoadjuvant treatment to shrink a tumor before surgery. Taxol can also be used together with a drug called Cisplatin to treat advanced ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved taxol as the primary and secondary treatment for NSCLC. There are other generally accepted protocols for the use of taxol as a cancer drug alone or in combination with other drugs depending upon the diagnosis, staging and type of cancer, as well as a patient’s medical history, tolerances and allergies, among other relevant factors.
 
The Chinese Herbal Medicine Standard (manual) of Heilogjiang Province (2011 version), edited by the HFDA, states that the Northeast yew has a secondary effect on treating cancer, meaning that while it has an impact on treating cancer, yew tree extract by itself (as distinguished from processed taxol) cannot be used as a stand-alone treatment of cancer. While the TCM raw material we sell contains taxol naturally, the companies to whom we sell such raw materials do not extract taxol from our TCM raw materials to produce pharmaceutical taxol.
 
Certain species of yew trees are the only natural source of taxol. Initially, taxol was extracted from the bark of the yew tree, but harvesting the bark usually kills the tree. Moreover, taxol is extracted from the bark of yew trees in extremely small amounts, often requiring the destruction of several yew trees to extract enough taxol to treat a single patient. Accordingly, taxol extracted from the yew is both very expensive and environmentally harmful. Because of environmental concerns about the adverse impact on forests in the Pacific Northwest in the United States, by the 1990s taxol ceased being derived from the bark of the Pacific yew. Alternative ways to develop taxol from renewable resources is ongoing. These include taxol-producing fungi from the yew tree and using other parts of the yew tree that may contain taxol.
 
We believe using yew trees that have been grown using our Asexual Reproduction Method significantly shortens the maturity cycle of naturally-grown yew trees and allows earlier commercialization of yew trees as a source of taxol. We further believe that using the branches and leaves of yew trees in large quantities, as we do, provides the key to solving the need for additional sources of taxol while not further endangering the PRC’s natural supply of yew trees, which themselves were over-forested in previous decades since the discovery of taxol.
 
The founder and President of our company, Zhiguo Wang, with the support of the Ministry of Forest and Science, and the Technology Department of Heilongjiang Province, successfully completed a project from 1984 to 1995 for asexual reproduction of the Northeast yew, and developed the first artificial cloned yew forest in the world. Tests conducted by the Ministry of Education’s Key Laboratory of Forest Plant Ecology in Northeast Forestry University have shown that the growing cycle of a cloned yew is significantly shorter than that of a natural yew and the concentration is taxol is higher. In 1995, this project received the Second Scientific and Technological Progress Award of Heilongjiang Province.
 
In December 2009, Yew Pharmaceutical received authorization from HFDA approving the sale of a yew-based TCM as a secondary treatment of cancer and certain other disorders, including uric disorders, certain liver diseases and menstrual discomfort. This TCM, sold under the brand name Zi Shan , has been approved to be sold under both prescription and over-the-counter drug categories. We also believe that Zi Shan may provide general beneficial effects on overall health. According to the Quintessence of Materia Medica, published in August 2006 by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Institute of Medicinal Plants, the Northeast yew plays a role as a diuretic, detumescence and in restoring menstrual flow. The approval from HFDA allows Yew Pharmaceutical to sell Zi Shan throughout the PRC.
 
In November 2010, Yew Pharmaceutical applied to the SFDA to approve an upgrade of Zi Shan from provincial to national standard, which we believe will enhance its general market acceptance and therefore could create additional demand for the raw materials we sell to Yew Pharmaceutical. As of the date of this report, the application is pending.
 
We entered into Cooperation and Development Agreement dated January 9, 2010, or the Development Agreement, with Yew Pharmaceutical, a related party, for the development, production and sale of yew-based TCM. Under the Development Agreement, we sell yew branches and leaves to Yew Pharmaceutical. Yew Pharmaceutical manufactures TCM at its own facilities in Harbin in accordance with the requirements of HFDA. Yew Pharmaceutical is also responsible for producing the finished product in accordance with good manufacturing practice, or GMP, requirements (in this regard, it received a GMP certificate in November 2009), and filing all applications with and obtaining all approvals from the HFDA.
 
Yew Pharmaceutical is the primary purchaser of the raw materials we sell in our TCM raw materials business. Pursuant to the Development Agreement, Yew Pharmaceutical pays us RMB1,000,000 per ton of raw material, whereas the current market price for such raw material is approximately RMB 1,100,000 per ton. The term of the Development Agreement is ten years, terminating on January 9, 2020. We began selling raw material in the form of branches and leaves of yew trees to Yew Pharmaceutical commencing in February 2010.

Yew Pharmaceutical is owned 95% by Heilongjiang Hongdoushan Ecology Forest Co., Ltd, a Chinese company, or HEFS, which itself is owned 63% by our founder, President and one of our directors, Zhiguo Wang, and 34% by his wife, Guifang Qi, who is also one of our directors. The remaining 5% is owned directly by Madame Qi. See Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”.
 
Since June 2010, other pharmaceutical companies have been purchasing yew raw materials from us to manufacture and sell TCM similar to Zi Shan in other provinces.
 
Yew Trees
 
We have developed a detailed process of yew tree breeding. We start growing yew trees from seedlings that we purchase from various third parties, including certain affiliates. These seedlings come from naturally-grown mature yew trees. Because yew trees are protected, yew seedlings are scarce. Prices have been rising for yew seedlings by approximately 20% per year in recent years and we expect that to continue for at least the next few years. Our largest supplier of yew seedlings is a company that is directly and indirectly owned primarily by Mr. Wang and Madame Qi. See “Suppliers” below and Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”.
 
We cultivate the yew seedlings at our nurseries for at least three to four years. Most of the land we lease from various parties for the growth of yew trees is location in and around Harbin. We have entered into several land use agreements with various parties, which provide the potential for us to grow a large number of yew trees on large areas of land over the next few decades, although we cannot currently estimate the number of trees we will grow or the total amount of land we will put into production over such period. Among these land use agreements, pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement, we have been granted permission to grow yew trees on up to 1,000,000 mu (approximately 166,667 acres) and to share profits 80% to the Company and 20% to the Wuchang Forestry Bureau. In addition, we have been provided two areas to use as nurseries for the cultivation of yew seedlings in the aggregate amount of 1,400 mu (approximately 233 acres). See Item 2, “Properties”.
 
When the yew trees are mature enough for transplanting, we prepare survey and design specifications for an afforestation plan. Once this has been prepared and approved, we clean and divide the reproducing area, clearing brushwood and weeds, and mark off breeding areas of between five and eight meters in width and less than one meter in length. We typically plant stock in the spring, when the defrosted soil is a depth of at least 15 centimeters.
 
The cut materials are then dried for a period of 18-20 hours at a temperature of between 55°C and 60°C, with the temperature monitored every three hours. After the drying process, the moisture content of the plant material should not exceed 8.0%. We then use a crusher to grind the plant material into a powder. The powder is mixed before being put into sealed plastic bags. The sealed plastic bags are put into outer shipping material and the package undergoes a final inspection before being ready for shipment.
 
By using our patented Asexual Reproduction Method, developed by our founder and President, Zhiguo Wang, we are able to accelerate the commercial viability of a yew tree, so that it is able to be used for commercialization starting in approximately three years, compared to more than 50 years for naturally grown yew trees. For example, the branches and leaves from an accelerated growth yew tree can be used in the production of TCM in three to five years, and a cutting from an accelerated growth yew tree will develop into a small yew tree that can be sold as a potted tree starting in approximately three years. We are authorized sell cuttings of cloned yew trees without a government permit.
 
We sell yew trees primarily to state-owned enterprises and private businesses for reforestation in Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province, in Northeast China. Historically, we have sold the majority of our yew trees to a small number of larger customers. However, even though we have a number of long-term customers, we do not enter into long-term agreements for the sale of our yew trees. Because our profit margin is smaller for larger customers due to volume price discounts, we are making efforts to increase sales to smaller customers. Our business relating to the sale of yew trees is seasonal. March to May, November and December are our strongest months.
 
After a period of three-to-seven years under cultivation, we also transplant some yew trees into decorative ceramic pots and sell these to retail customers for display in homes and offices. The Chinese people believe that in addition to its aesthetic qualities, yew trees help cleanse the air and reduce pollution. Accordingly, yew trees are purchased by individuals for personal use in their home or office and are often given as gifts. Yew trees can be found at landmarks around the world, including the White House and Lincoln Memorial.

We purchase high quality ceramic pots from third parties into which the yew trees are transplanted. We believe that there is a readily available supply of high-quality ceramic pots at relatively low and stable prices.
 
Because of the limited supply of yew trees and restrictions on the commercial use of yew trees, combined with the high quality of the ceramic pots we purchase from third-party sources, primarily in South China, used for the transplanted trees, the potted yew trees that we sell are highly prized and we charge premium retail prices by Chinese standards. Retail prices of potted yew trees vary based on the age, shape and other desirable qualities of the tree, and range from approximately RMB 280 to approximately RMB 3,080.
 
Handicrafts
 
Yew wood is of medium strength, making it possible to fashion products from the yew tree without undue effort or expense requiring special equipment. To create our current inventory of award-winning handicrafts, including furniture, historically we employed between 15 and 20 artisans from throughout the PRC, principally from Fujian Province and Jiangxi Province in southern China, annually from summer through late fall, to manufacture handicrafts made from yew timber at our production facility near Harbin. Since we currently have an adequate inventory of handicrafts, we now manufacture additional handicrafts only when orders are placed.
 
We begin the process of manufacturing handicrafts by selecting yew timber with greater variation in molding, which is indicative of a more attractive grain to the wood. The selected timber is then placed in a drying chamber and steam is injected to accelerate water evaporation until moisture content is only 3%. Depending upon the size and thickness of the timber, this process can take as long as one week.
 
The process of designing the item to be created begins with rough basing, based on geometrical form to summarize the overall artistic idea. During the entire process of carving the timber it is important to minimize knife scarring. Our crafted pieces typically go through a dying process; this not only can address certain small imperfections in the wood but is also done to aesthetically enhance the finished piece. After waiting at least twelve hours following dyeing, the carved item is then polished with sandpapers of different roughness and finally finishing cloths.
 
All of our products are hand-made, using yew tree timber of different maturities. Much of the furniture that we produce is reproductions of popular Ming and Qing Dynasty styles. We have acquired an inventory of yew timber from various parties over a number of years and have an adequate supply on hand for approximately five more years’ worth of production. Because of the scarcity of yew timber needed to produce handicrafts, it is very expensive to acquire new inventory of yew timber and supplies are extremely limited, if available at all. Accordingly, we plan to reduce and eventually eliminate our handicraft segment over the next several years.
 
Pursuant to the Department of Forestry of Heilongjiang Province (2003) Document No.188, issued by Department of Forestry of Heilongjiang Province on October 25, 2003, we have been granted rights to develop comprehensively and use Northeast yew resources. We believe that we are one of only a few companies in the PRC to have received approval for the manufacture of items made from yew timber.

Others
 
The others segment mainly includes the sales of yew candles, yew essential oil soap, complex taxus cuspidate extract, composite northeast yew extract and pine needle extracts. We started to sell yew candle products in the third quarter of 2015, pine needle extracts in the fourth quarter of 2015, yew essential oil soap in the fourth quarter of 2016, complex taxus cuspidate extract and composite northeast yew extract in the third quarter of 2017. The others segment generated $14,058,012 in revenues in 2018.
Suppliers
 
We obtain yew forest assets and yew seedlings from several sources. Prior to January 1, 2011, our largest supplier was Zishan Technology Co., Ltd., or ZTC, a related party. We believe that we pay market rate for the seedlings and cuttings we purchase from our suppliers. ZTC is an entity under common control with the Company. See Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”.
 
None of the agreements we have with our suppliers are long-term contracts, meaning they can be canceled at any time. We believe that the supply of yew seedlings is readily available and if we lost one of our suppliers, we could readily find a replacement.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We sell most of our products in the Chinese domestic market. The sale of yew trees for reforestation in Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province is to both state-owned enterprises and private businesses.
 
We sold our products to a relatively small number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the following customers accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue:
 

● | Yew Pharmaceutical accounted for approximately 58% of our consolidated revenue 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | DMSU, accounted for approximately 18% of our consolidated revenue 

 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the following customers accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue:
 

● | Yew Pharmaceutical accounted for approximately 50% of our consolidated revenue 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Dafurong Biotechnology (HK) Ltd., accounted for approximately 43% of our consolidated revenue 

 
Yew Pharmaceutical is the manufacturer of Zi Shan and other pharmaceutical products, and is owned, directly and indirectly, primarily by Zhiguo Wang and Guifang Qi.
 
The sale of furniture and handicrafts from our cultivated yew trees, as well as the sale of potted yew trees for display in homes and offices, is to the Chinese domestic market. We exhibit and warehouse potted yew trees, handicrafts and furniture at a facility located in Harbin.
 
Retail prices for potted yew trees are high by Chinese standards, but have remained stable. We provide the potted yew trees that we sell, from our nurseries. The supply of ceramic pots that we purchase from third-party suppliers that we use to transplant cultivated yew trees is good and prices are stable.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe that we are able to cultivate and grow yew trees successfully and faster by using our patented Asexual Reproduction Method, based on principles of asexual propagation and cloning, developed by our founder and President, Zhiguo Wang. Our patented Asexual Reproduction Method functions through cell replication with identical genes, sometimes referred to as cloning, of Northeast Yew with only a single parent present.
 
Mr. Wang first studied yew cloning techniques in 1982, for the purpose of addressing the long reproduction time, low reproduction rates and weak survival rates for yew trees in general. With the support of the Ministry of Forest and Science, and the Technology Department of Heilongjiang Province, Mr. Wang successfully completed a project from 1984 to 1995 for asexual cultivation and cloning technology of the yew, and developed the first artificial cloned yew forest in the world. Tests conducted by the Ministry of Education’s Key Laboratory of Forest Plant Ecology in Northeast Forestry University have shown that the growing cycle of a cultivated yew is significantly shorter than that of a natural yew and the concentration is taxol is higher.
 
We have been issued two patents related to our advanced growth technology:
 

● | “Yew Tree Plant Extracts, Methods for Extracting the Plant Extracts and Application”, or the Yew Extract Method, was granted by the State Intellectual Property Office, or SIPO, to HDS on August 16, 2011. This patent had previously been held by Heilongjiang Yew Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. This patent is valid for 20 years, from June 23, 2004 through June 22, 2024. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | “Northeast Yew Asexual Reproduction Method”, or the Asexual Reproduction Method, was granted by SIPO to HDS on September 21, 2011. This patent is valid for 20 years, from September 30, 2010 through September 29, 2030. 

 
We believe that our patented Asexual Reproduction Method has three unique advantages:
 

● | The Asexual Reproduction Method addresses the low rooting rate problem and accelerates the seedling rate and the maturity period for Northeast yew. It increases the rooting rate to over 80% and the seedling rate to over 85% for Northeast yew. It can bring the Northeast yew to maturity and ready for commercialization for medical use in as little as two-to-three years, compared to more than 50 years for naturally growing yew trees. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Large colonies can form to out-compete other organisms for nutrients. The active ingredients in the offspring were relatively stable with little difference. 
● | There is high chance of survival of the offspring with little variation. 

 
We do not currently own any trade names, trademarks or service marks the loss of which would be materially adverse to our business.

Competition
 
We believe that we face little competition within the PRC for the growth and cultivation of yew trees because of the amount of space needed for proper cultivation of yew trees, the long period to maturity of the yew tree, the difficulties of propagation, the scarcity of yews and the regulation of the yew industry in the PRC. Because of the need for governmental approval to grow, cultivate and commercialize yew trees, we believe that there are high barriers to entry to our industry.
 
Most of our competitors are smaller companies that do not have cloning technology and therefore have to engage in substantially longer growing cycles to commercialize yew trees. Our main competitors in the growth of yew trees and cultivation of yew cuttings include Zhejiang Changshan Mandiya Yew Science and Technology Limited Company, located in Zhejiang, China; and Luo Yang Madia Yew Science and Technology Development Limited Company, or Luo Yang, located in Henan, China. For example, Luo Yang has only approximately 300 mu (approximately 50 acres) of yew seedlings under cultivation.
 
There is significant competition for the sale of furniture, handicrafts and potted trees in the PRC. This is a highly-fragmented industry in the PRC with innumerable competitors and little, if any, concentration of market share locally, regionally or nationally. Many of our competitors are probably larger than we are and can devote more resources than we can to the manufacture, distribution and sale of furniture, handicrafts and potted trees. Additionally, many of our competitors sell furniture and handicrafts, not made of yew trees, at prices considerably lower than the premium prices at which we sell our products. However, we believe that there is relatively little competition within the Chinese domestic market for our premium-priced yew products, primarily because of the scarcity of yew trees and the regulation of the yew industry in the PRC. We believe that we are the only business in the PRC that has been given permission to produce furniture and handicrafts from yew timber.
 
While we do not manufacture TCM or any taxol-based product ourselves, we could be seen as indirectly competing with companies that do manufacture taxol-based medicine. We face potential competition from many providers of TCM for many ailments. With respect to TCM specifically for use as a secondary treatment for cancer, we may be seen to compete with companies such as Fujian Leephick Pharmaceutical Limited Company, or Fujian Leephick, located in Wuping, China, and Qi Ao Chinese Medicine Tablet Co., Ltd., or Qi Ao, located in Anguo City, Hebei Province, China. Fujian Leephick is a fairly new company that we believe is only in an early stage of its research and development. Qi Ao can be differentiated from our company in that Qi Ao does not cultivate yew trees and requires third party supply of raw materials to produce TCM, whereas we produce the raw materials and sell them to our affiliate under the Development Agreement for the production of TCM, thereby providing a reliable supply of raw materials combined with the financial assurance of being paid up-front rather than being paid depending upon the timing and amount of sales to purchasers of the TCM.

Plant and Equipment
 
The machinery and other equipment that we use in making our products are manufactured, for the most part, in the PRC. We conduct our own maintenance of our machinery and equipment. Replacement parts are relatively easy to obtain without delays as and when required and are not subject to significant price fluctuations.
Government Regulations
 
Certain parts of our business are regulated under national, provincial and local laws in the PRC. The following information summarizes certain major regulations that apply to us.
 
Regulations at the national, provincial and local levels in the PRC are subject to change. To date, compliance with governmental regulations has not had a material impact on our earnings or competitive position, but, because of the evolving nature of such regulations, we are unable to predict the impact such regulation may have in the foreseeable future.
 
The growing and cultivation of yew trees and manufacturing products from yew trees, is regulated by Forest Law and its Implementing Regulations, Rules on Permit for Felling of Forest Trees, Regulations on Wild Plants Protection and other PRC laws and regulations. HDS received approval issued by the Department of Forestry of Heilongjiang Province (Document No. 188) on October 25, 2003, allowing it to sell yew trees and manufacture handicrafts using yew timber. There is no cost to the Company to maintain this approval. This approval has no expiration date.
 
As a foreign-invested enterprise, JSJ is subject to the Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law (1986), as amended, and the Regulations of Implementation of the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (1990), as amended, both of which provide for incorporation, corporate governance, operation, business and other aspects of a foreign-invested enterprise.
 
PRC resident shareholders of the Company are required to complete foreign exchange registration with the State Administration on Foreign Exchange, or SAFE. In October 2005, SAFE issued the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-raising and Return Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, or SAFE Circular 75, which became effective as of November 1, 2005, and was further supplemented by two implementation notices issued by the SAFE on November 24, 2005, May 29, 2007 and July1, 2011, respectively. SAFE Circular 75 states that PRC residents, whether natural or legal persons, must register with the relevant local SAFE branch prior to establishing or taking control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas equity financing involving onshore assets or equity interests held by them.
 
In 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies jointly adopted Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rule. The M&A Rule requires that, if an overseas company established or controlled by PRC domestic companies or citizens intends to acquire equity interests or assets of any other PRC domestic company affiliated with the PRC domestic companies or citizens, such acquisition must be submitted to the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, rather than local regulators, for approval. In addition, this regulation requires that an overseas company controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or citizens and holding equity interests of PRC domestic companies needs to obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, prior to listing its securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published a notice on its official website specifying the documents and materials required to be submitted by overseas special purpose companies seeking CSRC’s approval of their overseas listings.
 
Environmental Issues
 
Our operations are subject to various pollution control regulations with respect to noise, water and air pollution and the disposal of waste and hazardous materials. We are also subject to periodic inspections by local environmental protection authorities. Our operating facilities have received certifications from the relevant PRC government agencies in charge of environmental protection indicating that the operations are in compliance with the relevant PRC environmental laws and regulations.
 
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business. We are not currently subject to any pending actions alleging any violations of applicable PRC environmental laws.

Corporate Recapitalization
 
Recapitalization
 
Generally, the founders of a corporation in the United States receive shares of stock in consideration of the tangible and intangible assets contributed by them to the enterprise. Since the consideration for those shares is the transfer of assets, including intellectual property, and business know-how, sometimes referred to as “sweat equity”, no cash payment for such shares occurs.
 
However, unfamiliar with the usual way that founders acquire equity interests in corporations in the United States, the HDS Shareholders both contributed assets to the Company and actually purchased their HDS Shareholders’ Stock between March 2008 and September 2009, for cash, in a series of four different offerings of YBP common stock during that period, at prices ranging between $0.02 and $0.10 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $966,501.
 
As a result of the Contractual Arrangements of the Second Restructure, in which all of the profits of HDS will be paid under the terms of the Business Cooperation Agreement to JSJ, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of YBP, combined with the actual purchase by the HDS Shareholders of the HDS Shareholders’ Stock for cash, it could be viewed that Mr. Wang, Madame Qi and Mr. Han have, in effect, paid for their HDS Shareholders’ Stock twice.
 
Accordingly, the Company rectified this situation by obtaining shareholder approval at the Special Meeting on December 13, 2012 to issue a stock purchase option, each referred to as a Founder’s Option and collectively referred to as the Founders’ Options, to each of Mr. Wang and Madame Qi in an amount equal to the number of shares of YBP common stock that each of them then currently owned. The terms of the Founders’ Options are identical to each other except for the name of the optionee and the number of shares of YBP common stock subject to each such Founder’s Option. Those terms include:
 

● | the issuance of the Founders’ Options was subject to pre-issuance approval by our shareholders, which approval was obtained at the Special Meeting; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | each Founder’s Option was fully vested upon issuance; 
● | each Founder’s Option is exercisable for a period of five years; the expiration date for each Founder’s Option is extended to June 30, 2018; 
● | each Founder’s Option has a per share exercise price equal to the fair market value of a shares of YBP common stock on the date of grant, or $0.22 per share; and 
● | each Founder’s Option has a cashless exercise feature, pursuant to which, at the optionee’s election, he or she may choose to deliver previously-owned shares of YBP common stock in payment of the exercise price or not pay the exercise price of the Founder’s Option and receive instead a reduced number of shares of YBP common stock reflecting the value of the number of shares of YBP common stock equal to the difference, if any, between the aggregate fair market value of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Founder’s Option and the exercise price of the Founder’s Option.

The number of shares of YBP common stock subject to each Founder’s Option is as follows:
 

Number of Optionee | Number of Shares Subject to Founder’s Option | 
-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+-----------
Zhioguo Wang | | 20,103,475
Guifang Qi | | 2,439,737 

 
The terms of the Founders’ Options have not been determined as a result of arm’s-length negotiations. The Board of Directors of YBP, which consists of the same persons who are the HDS Shareholders and the grantees of the Founders’ Options, obtained shareholder approval of the issuance of the Founders’ Options at the Special Meeting on December 13, 2012.
 
To the extent that the Founders’ Options are exercised, the number of shares of YBP common stock then held by each HDS Shareholder could as much as double, which would be highly dilutive to the other existing YBP shareholders. The following chart shows the maximum effect of this dilution assuming full exercise of each Founder’s Option for cash:
 

Shareholder | Number of Shares Presently Held | | Percentage of Issued Shares Presently Held | | Number of Shares Held Assuming Exercise of All Founders’ Options | Percentage of Issued Shares Following Exercise of All Founders’ Options 
--------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zhiguo Wang | | 20,103,475 | | 38.60 | % | 25,103,475 | 42.15 | %
Guifang Qi | | 2,439,737 | | 4.69 | % | 4,928,474 | 8.27 | %
All HDS Shareholders as a group (2 persons) | | 22,543,212 | | 43.29 | % | 30,031,949 | 50.42 | %
All other existing shareholders | | 29,531,788 | | 56.71 | % | 29,531,788 | 49.58 | %
Total | | 52,075,000 | | 100.00 | % | 59,563,737 | 100.00 | %

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 39 full-time employees. Our employees that work in China belong to a trade union. We believe that we maintain good labor relations with our employees. We also hire additional people for brief periods of time during peak production and processing seasons.
