OVERVIEW

We are a pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing drug candidates for diseases that are treated by specialist physicians, with an initial focus on addressing thrombocytopenia, a disorder characterized by a low blood platelet count. On May 21, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved DOPTELET (avatrombopag), which is an orally administered thrombopoietin receptor agonist ("TPO-RA") for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease (“CLD”) scheduled to undergo a procedure.
On April 27, 2018, we also submitted a marketing authorization application ("MAA") with the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") for this same indication. We have received the 180-day questions and continue to work towards a resolution of outstanding questions. Furthermore, on August 30, 2018, we submitted a supplemental New Drug Application ("sNDA") to FDA for DOPTELET, seeking approval for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia ("ITP") who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment. On October 29, 2018, FDA accepted the sNDA for review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") goal date of June 30, 2019.
We are also conducting a Phase 3 trial in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia ("CIT"). We expect to report results for the primary and select secondary endpoints from this trial in the first half of 2020.

Overview of thrombocytopenia and current treatments

Thrombocytopenia is characterized by a deficiency of platelets that impairs blood clot formation and increases bleeding risk. Thrombocytopenia is defined as having less than 150,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood and is diagnosed with a routine blood test. Thrombocytopenia can result in significant bleeding risk even in cases of minor injury. Platelet deficiency can also increase the risk of excessive, uncontrolled bleeding during or after a medical or surgical procedure.

Physicians determine how to treat thrombocytopenia, either in the acute setting or chronically, based on a number of factors, including the patient’s platelet count, etiology of the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia, duration of required platelet count elevation and the patient’s overall health profile. Acute prophylactic treatment of thrombocytopenia involves platelet transfusions, which are currently used in patients with CLD in advance of medical or surgical procedures and also in connection with other medical treatments that reduce platelet counts, such as chemotherapy. Despite being the standard of care, platelet transfusions are associated with limitations that impact their use including variable efficacy, transfusion reactions, risk of antibody development in up to 50% of patients, short duration of effect of transfused platelets, limited supply and inconvenience of administration. 

Chronic treatment of thrombocytopenia involves continuous treatment of the disorder. The substantial majority of patients who require chronic treatment for thrombocytopenia suffer from ITP. Treatments for ITP target one of the following mechanisms: reduction of autoimmune activity that causes abnormal platelet destruction, surgical removal of the spleen to prevent trapping of platelets in the spleen or stimulation of platelet production. First-line therapy for ITP is typically focused on reducing autoimmune activity and consists of corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin ("IVIG"). Second line alternatives include rituximab, which is used off-label to reduce autoimmune activity, and splenectomy to address the trapping of the platelets in the spleen. Currently marketed TPO-RAs, which aim to stimulate platelet production, are also used in the second line treatment of ITP. However, we believe these available treatments have limitations that impact their use, such as limited efficacy, risk to patient safety, patient non-compliance or inconvenience.

Because of the limitations of current therapies used for thrombocytopenia in the acute and chronic setting, we believe there remains a significant unmet need for a treatment that demonstrates reliable and predictable effectiveness and a favorable safety profile, that can be conveniently administrated and potentially reduce the bleeding risk for patients.

DOPTELET

DOPTELET is designed to mimic the effects of thrombopoietin ("TPO"), in vitro and in vivo. TPO is a hormone produced in the liver and kidneys that binds to its receptor, c-Mpl (myeloproliferative leukemia protein). Following TPO receptor binding, intracellular signaling leads to megakaryocyte growth and maturation, which results in increased platelet production. TPO-RAs, 
1

like TPO, stimulate the activation, proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes, resulting in an increase in circulating platelets.
DOPTELET is a highly specific TPO-RA and it binds to the TPO receptor at a distinct site from native TPO, leaving the TPO receptor accessible to native TPO, enabling DOPTELET to have a potential additive effect to TPO on platelet production.

We believe DOPTELET addresses the shortcomings associated with the standard of care, platelet transfusions, including the risk of transfusion reactions, antibody development in up to 50% of patients, short duration of effect of transfused platelets, limited supply and inconvenience of administration. In addition, we believe DOPTELET's efficacy and safety profiles and convenient oral dosing, taken with food, differentiate it from the TPO-RAs currently marketed for ITP. We believe attributes specific to DOPTELET make it a compelling treatment option for patients with thrombocytopenia in both the acute and chronic settings.

There are an estimated 7.4 million CLD patients in the United States. Thrombocytopenia affects approximately 1.1 million of those patients and approximately 70,000 of those patients have a platelet count of less than 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood. Based on a third-party survey of 155 community and academic physicians that we commissioned in 2017, approximately 60% of these patients are treated with platelet transfusions in order to raise their platelet counts prior to a procedure and a small percentage of these patients are treated with currently available TPO-RAs off-label. These patients generally undergo one to three medical procedures per year. Many of the CLD patients affected by thrombocytopenia are treated by one of the approximately 850 hepatologists, most of whom are working at one of the approximately 150 liver transplant centers in the United States.

ITP affects approximately 60,000 adults in the United States and despite the currently available therapies, there remains an important unmet need for patients with ITP. We believe that DOPTELET, along with currently marketed TPO-RAs Promacta and Nplate for the treatment of patients with ITP alone, has an approximately $800 million addressable market in the United States and an approximately $1.5 billion worldwide addressable market.
There are currently no marketed products for CIT. Once a patient develops CIT, the most common options for the patient are to delay chemotherapy treatments, reduce the chemotherapy dose or receive a platelet transfusion.

We hold the worldwide rights to DOPTELET for all current and future indications, which we acquired from Eisai in March 2016. Our intellectual property strategy aims to protect and control the development and commercialization of DOPTELET. Our owned and in-licensed patents provide us with composition of matter and method of use exclusivity with respect to DOPTELET in the United States, including a composition of matter patent that expires in 2025, with possible patent term extension up to 2029. We also hold patents and applications in major world markets with respect to DOPTELET, which are projected to expire between 2023 and 2032, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country.

Potential Additional Indications for DOPTELET:
Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)
On August 30, 2018, we submitted a sNDA to FDA for DOPTELET, seeking approval for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with ITP who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment. On October 29, 2018, FDA accepted the sNDA for review with a PDUFA goal date of June 30, 2019. Our sNDA is supported by safety and efficacy data from one pivotal randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial in the target indication that met its primary and first secondary efficacy endpoints with high statistical significance (p<0.0001). Additional supportive efficacy data for the ITP sNDA are provided by two Phase 2 ITP clinical trials, one discontinued Phase 3 ITP trial, as well as the two Phase 3 trials for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD. In total, 128 subjects with ITP have been treated with DOPTELET with a median duration of treatment of 7 months and a maximum duration of treatment of greater than 2 years.  Data from all 24 studies in the DOPTELET clinical development program support the safety and tolerability of DOPTELET across multiple indications.

In our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with ITP, a total of 49 patients were randomized to receive either DOPTELET (n=32) or placebo (n=17). The trial met its primary endpoint by showing that DOPTELET was superior to placebo for the cumulative number of weeks that subjects achieved platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood (12.4 weeks in the treatment group compared to 0 weeks in the placebo group (p<0.0001)). Additionally, for the first secondary efficacy endpoint, we observed superior platelet response at day eight for patients treated with DOPTELET as compared to placebo (p<0.0001). In addition, in the Phase 3 clinical trial and two Phase 2 clinical trials of DOPTELET for the treatment of adults with chronic ITP, DOPTELET has been observed to have a favorable exposure-adjusted safety profile with chronic administration. 
Chemotherapy-induced Thrombocytopenia (“CIT”)
We are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of DOPTELET in subjects receiving treatment for non-hematological cancers such as ovarian, non-small cell lung and bladder cancer who develop CIT, defined as platelet count of less than 50,000 platelets per microliter in their previous cycle of chemotherapy. With approximately 125,000 platelet transfusions administered every year for cancer patients who develop CIT, we believe this market represents a significant market expansion opportunity for DOPTELET. We expect to enroll a total of 120 patients in the trial. The primary endpoint of the trial is the proportion of patients not requiring a platelet transfusion, not requiring a dose reduction of chemotherapy by at least15%, and not requiring a chemotherapy schedule delay by at least four days. We expect to report primary and select secondary endpoint data from this trial in the first half of 2020. 

Pre-surgery Thrombocytopenia ("PST") and CLD Registry Study
During the first half of 2018, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate DOPTELET for the treatment of a broader population of patients with thrombocytopenia undergoing surgery and a post marketing registry study for CLD patients, both 
3

designed for publication purposes.  Due to our decision to focus on developing DOPTELET for ITP and CIT, we decided to discontinue these trials during the first quarter of 2019.
MANUFACTURING

We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We rely on Eisai, acting as our contract manufacturer, for the production of DOPTELET for clinical trials and commercial supply. We have a supply agreement with Eisai that governs this manufacturing support. 

We believe Eisai’s manufacturing processes are in compliance with guidance from global regulatory authorities such that the drug should meet the manufacturing requirements for world-wide distribution pending appropriate regulatory clearance in the applicable jurisdiction. 
We are in process of establishing a second source manufacturer for DOPTELET to ensure continuity of product supply.
COMMERCIALIZATION

United States 
We commercially launched DOPTELET for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with CLD during the second quarter of 2018. We began with a field sales force of 50 sales representatives and eventually grew to 75 representatives in the third quarter of 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we executed a robust commercially driven healthcare provider education effort that included more than 125 speaker programs with key opinion leader presenters that reached more than 1,150 unique attendees. In December 2018, we hired a Chief Commercial Officer who is leading a reassessment of our launch efforts including our sales force deployment, the marketing and messaging of the product and our market access strategy. As a result, in January 2019, we refocused our sales deployment to reduce redundancy in call points among the field teams. As such, our specialty team of 44 sales representatives and five regional sales directors are focused on driving DOPTELET sales primarily within the hepatology, hematology and interventional radiology call points. We expect to implement revised marketing and messaging in the second quarter of 2019.

In September 2018, we entered into a Co-Promotion Agreement (the "Co-Promotion Agreement") with the Salix division of Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC (“Salix”), a subsidiary of Bausch Health Companies Inc. The Co-Promotion Agreement requires approximately 100 Salix sales representatives (subject to certain adjustments) to promote DOPTELET to specified medical professionals in the Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery and Proctology fields ("the Specialty) in the United States. Salix is required to ensure the incentive compensation package for each of its sales representatives promoting DOPTELET is at least 50% of the target incentive compensation derived from achieving target sales of DOPTELET. Pursuant to the Co-Promotion Agreement, we pay Salix a fee based on the quarterly Net Sales (as defined in the Co-Promotion Agreement) of DOPTELET to specified medical professionals in the Specialty in the United States at specified tiered percentages, ranging from Salix receiving a mid-twenties to mid-thirties percent of Net Sales in a calendar year, subject to specified adjustments. In addition, we have agreed to pay Salix a milestone payment of $2,500,000 upon the achievement of an aggregate Net Sales amount to the Specialty. For further information on our Co-Promotion Agreement, please refer to our "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
International
Development and Distribution Agreement with Fosun
On March 16, 2018, we entered into a Manufacturing and Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Industrial Development Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd., (collectively, “Fosun”) pursuant to which we granted Fosun the exclusive development and distribution rights of DOPTELET in mainland China and Hong Kong (the “Territory”). Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, Fosun will have the right to exclusively commercialize and to assist us with the registration of DOPTELET in the Territory.  Fosun is solely responsible for commercialization activities in the Territory and associated expenses. We are responsible for supplying finished drug product at a fixed price to Fosun for the distribution of product upon approval. 
Under the Distribution Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront payment of $4.5 million during the second quarter of 2018, which consisted of an upfront payment of $5.0 million, less $0.5 million that was withheld in accordance with tax withholding requirements in China.  We are also eligible to receive additional future payments upon the achievement of certain 
4

regulatory milestones. For further information on our Distribution Agreement, please refer to our "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We continue to pursue collaborations with third parties to commercialize DOPTELET outside the United States, either through territorial licenses or distributor relationships. In the future, we also may selectively partner with leading companies that we believe can contribute additional resources and know-how for the development and commercialization of DOPTELET for additional indications and geographic regions.

We believe that it is imperative to keep the patient at the center of our focus, and we intend to work with and listen closely to key stakeholders, including patient advocacy groups, healthcare professionals, key opinion leaders and academic institutions, to ensure that we clearly understand their issues, insights and recommendations. The feedback from and collaboration with these groups will inform our key strategies.

COMPETITION

The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future.

The key competitive factors affecting the success of DOPTELET, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, pricing and durability.

CLD: With respect to DOPTELET for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD scheduled to undergo a procedure, our main competitor is Shionogi's Mulpleta (lusutrombopag), which launched in the United States during the third quarter of 2018. Mulpleta is another TPO-RA indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD undergoing planned procedures and has previously been approved in Japan. In February 2019, Shionogi received European Union Marketing Authorization for lusutrombopag for the treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with CLD undergoing invasive procedures. 

ITP: With respect to DOPTELET for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with ITP, we anticipate competing directly with the currently marketed TPO-RAs Promacta and Nplate as well as Tavalisse, an oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor. In addition, we are aware that, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Shire PLC, Immunomedics Inc., Protalex Inc. and others are developing drugs that may have utility for the treatment of ITP.
CIT: With respect to DOPTELET for the treatment of CIT, there are currently no approved pharmaceutical products for the treatment of CIT. Amgen has announced plans to evaluate Nplate for the treatment of CIT in a Phase 3 study beginning in 2019. In addition, new oncology therapies may decrease the use of traditional chemotherapy agents that cause severe thrombocytopenia.
We are also aware of several other drug candidates in earlier stages of development as potential treatments for the indications that we are targeting.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

As of January 17, 2019, we own 25 foreign patents and one foreign patent application related to DOPTELET, and we license from Astellas three granted U.S. patents, 74 foreign patents and two foreign patent applications related to DOPTELET. Our patent portfolio for DOPTELET includes a patent family directed to the DOPTELET composition of matter and methods of using DOPTELET, which is expected to expire between 2023 and 2029, including available patent term adjustment and potential patent term extension (which has been requested and is currently under review). Our patent portfolio for DOPTELET also includes a European patent directed to the crystalline avatrombopag compound, which is expected to expire in 2032, excluding any patent term extension and patent term adjustment that may be available.

Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the 
5

"USPTO"), delay in issuing the patent, and extended to recapture a portion of the patent term effectively lost as a result of FDA regulatory review period of the drug covered by the patent. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years, the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval of the drug, and the extension may only apply to one patent that covers the approved drug (and to only those patent claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it). There can be no assurance that any such patent term adjustment or extension will be obtained. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.

Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. If we are found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our drugs and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could also be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or drug. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations. For more information regarding these risks, please see “Risk Factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.”

Eisai Stock Purchase Agreement

We acquired worldwide rights to DOPTELET from Eisai in March 2016 pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, (the "Eisai stock purchase agreement"). Under the Eisai stock purchase agreement, we acquired all of the shares of our wholly-owned subsidiary AkaRx, Inc ("AkaRx"). Pursuant to the Eisai stock purchase agreement, Eisai received an upfront payment of $5.0 million and we are obligated to pay Eisai aggregate milestone payments up to $135.0 million based on annual net sales of DOPTELET, which are calculated on an annual basis. The rights to DOPTELET, including any associated intellectual property and regulatory rights, are subject to a right of reversion in the event we fail to make any required milestone payment or in the event we elect to discontinue the DOPTELET program. Until we pay Eisai all of the milestone payments contemplated under the Eisai stock purchase agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize and sell DOPTELET. For further information on our Eisai Agreement, as well as our other agreements with Eisai such as our Transition Services Agreement, Amended and Restated Transition Services Agreement, an Additional Work Order and our Supply Agreement, please refer to our "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

License agreement with Astellas

The primary intellectual property related to DOPTELET is licensed to us from Astellas on an exclusive, worldwide basis under the terms of a license agreement we acquired from Eisai in connection with our acquisition of the rights to DOPTELET from Eisai. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to make payments upon the achievement of certain milestones. On September 21, 2017, upon the submission of the NDA, we became obligated to make a milestone payment of $1.0 million within 30 days.  This payment was made in October 2017.  We will be required to make additional aggregate milestone payments of up to $4.0 million to Astellas if certain other regulatory milestones are achieved. No amounts have been accrued for any potential future milestone payments as such payments have not been deemed probable. In addition, upon the launch of DOPTELET, we started paying Astellas royalties on net sales of DOPTELET. Our royalty rates are tiered in the mid to high single-digit percentages.  See Note 4 “The purchase agreement and related transactions” in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

FDA drug approval process

In the United States, drugs are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, clinical and preclinical testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of drugs. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the drug development process may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs warning or untitled letters, imposition of a clinical hold, withdrawal of approval, drug recalls, drug seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.

We cannot market a drug candidate in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval.

The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following:


• | completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice ("GLP"), regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB"), at each clinical site or a central IRB serving multiple client sites before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”);


• | requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;


• | satisfactory completion by the FDA of study site(s) and/or sponsor inspections;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API"), and finished drug are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP requirements; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States and review and approval of any supplemental NDA prior to any commercial marketing for additional clinical use indications.

Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the drug or disease.

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of drug chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the drug. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. An IND sponsor must submit the results of preclinical testing to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about drug chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.

A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. If the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will 
7

be exposed to an unreasonable health risk, the FDA may require that the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, including GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and subsequent protocol amendment must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.

The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB, for approval for each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health ("NIH"), for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a larger patient population to determine metabolism, PK, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in some instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, reversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome, when confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.

Clinical studies at each phase of development may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB, the sponsor or the data monitoring committee, if applicable, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted, as well as the sponsor’s offices, if appropriate.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the drug may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the drug’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act ("PREA"), an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective or these data may be collected as part of a post-marketing requirement if agreed to by the FDA. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. Under the PDUFA guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes 12 months from the date the NDA for the new molecular entity is submitted to FDA because the FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.

Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective, whether the data are consistent and reliable and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, 
8

processed, packaged or held meets industry and regulatory standards designed to assure the drug’s continued safety, quality and purity.

The FDA may also refer applications for a novel drug, or drug that presents difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the drug unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA and the FDA has determined that the drug is safe and effective and provides clinical benefit, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type and complexity of information included.

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications, i.e., the label. Even if the FDA approves a drug, it may limit the approved indications for use of the drug, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the drug labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the drug after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ("REMS"), to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include a medication guide, a communication plan for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, such as special training and certification requirements for individuals who prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. Once granted, drug approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. Such supplements are typically reviewed within 10 months of receipt for a standard review or 6 months for a priority review. FDA inspections may also occur during the review of an NDA supplement to assess manufacturing or clinical sites.

Post-approval requirements 

At the time an NDA or NDA supplement is approved, a drug may be subject to certain post-approval requirements, which may include additional clinical trials. In addition, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. Drugs may be marketed and promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.

Post-marketing pharmacovigilance activities, adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also routinely conducts inspections of the sponsor or delegated vendors to ensure compliance with quality systems, appropriate oversight, collection and review of safety data and product complaints. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved drug, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the drug. In addition, quality- control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or 
9

clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:


• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the drug, complete withdrawal of the drug from the market or drug recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of drug approvals;


• | barring individuals from continued involvement in the pharmaceutical industry;


• | drug seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of drugs; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively monitor compliance and enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.

Foreign regulation 

In order to market any drug outside of the United States, we need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we would need to also obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional drug testing, clinical trials and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, (“CHMP”). At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the European Commission. If this opinion is favorable, the Commission may then adopt a decision to grant a marketing authorization. All new European MAAs must include a risk management plan describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization.
Other healthcare laws

Our current and future business operations may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other.

10

Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce 
s of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.

Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.

The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a drug off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our drugs, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our drugs, and the sale and marketing of our drugs, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal civil False Claims Act is a civil statute, violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.

Additionally, to the extent that any of our drugs are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ("HITECH"), and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandate, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain healthcare providers, that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.
11


The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which was created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the Affordable Care Act), imposes, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in significant civil monetary penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation or other remuneration to physicians.

Because we commercialize drugs that are reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we have developed a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal control to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we have become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.

Health reform

In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.

In particular, the Affordable Care Act has had a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to drugs, among other things, the Affordable Care Act revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drugs. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare providers and entities, and certain provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective.

In addition, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Act") includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called ‘‘Cadillac’’ tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 ("BBA"), among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In July 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"), published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. 
12


Moreover, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed drugs, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 (the "Right to Try Act"), was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of drugs, among others, related to drug tracking and tracing, which will be phased in over several years beginning in 2016. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug to individuals and entities to which drug ownership is transferred, label drug with a drug identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug. The transfer of information to subsequent drug owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ drugs are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufacturers will have drug investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated drugs, as well as drugs that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.

Government programs for marketed drugs
Medicaid, the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and Medicare
13

Federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having its products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for all units of its covered outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program under either a fee-for-service arrangement or through a managed care organization. This federal requirement is effectuated through a Medicaid drug rebate agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary of HHS. CMS administers the Medicaid drug rebate agreements, which provide, among other things, that the drug manufacturer will pay rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis and report certain price information on a monthly and quarterly basis. The rebates are based on prices reported to CMS by manufacturers for their covered outpatient drugs. For innovator products, that is, drugs that are marketed under approved NDAs, the basic rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the best price for that same quarter. The AMP is the weighted average of prices paid to the manufacturer (1) directly by retail community pharmacies and (2) by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies. The best price is essentially the lowest price available to non-governmental entities. Innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate that is based on the amount, if any, by which the product’s current AMP has increased over the baseline AMP, which is the AMP for the first full quarter after launch, adjusted for inflation. For non-innovator products, generally generic drugs marketed under approved abbreviated new drug applications, the basic rebate amount is 13% of the AMP for the quarter. Until recent amendments to the statute, this was the only rebate applicable to non-innovator products. However, as a result of a November 2015 amendment, non-innovator products are subject to an additional rebate. The additional rebate is similar to that discussed above for innovator products, except that the baseline AMP quarter is the fifth full quarter after launch (for non-innovator multiple source drugs launched on April 1, 2013 or later) or the third quarter of 2014 (for those launched before April 1, 2013). The statutory definition of AMP was amended by the Affordable Care Act. In February 2016, CMS published a final rule to further define AMP and provide clarification on other parts of the rebate program. The terms of participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in additional or lesser rebate liability, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if a manufacturer were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
A manufacturer must also participate in a federal program known as the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available to pay for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under this program, the participating manufacturer agrees to charge certain safety net healthcare providers no more than an established discounted price for its covered outpatient drugs. The formula for determining the discounted price is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and the unit rebate amount as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above. Manufacturers have not been required to report any pricing information to the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), but HRSA issued a notice proposing to collect such information from manufacturers on a quarterly basis and is in the process of preparing a system to operationalize this requirement. HRSA has also issued regulations relating to the calculation of the ceiling price as well as imposition of civil monetary penalties for each instance of knowingly and intentionally overcharging a 340B covered entity. Medicare Part D provides prescription drug benefits for seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare Part D beneficiaries have a gap in their coverage (between the initial coverage limit and the point at which catastrophic coverage begins) where Medicare does not cover their prescription drug costs, known as the coverage gap. However, by 2020, Medicare Part D beneficiaries will pay 25% of drug costs after they reach the initial coverage limit - the same percentage they were responsible for before they reached that limit - thereby closing the coverage gap. The cost of closing the coverage gap is being borne by innovator companies and the government through subsidies. Beginning in 2011, each manufacturer of drugs approved under NDAs was required to enter into a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount agreement and provide a 50% discount on those drugs dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries in the coverage gap, in order for its drugs to be reimbursed by Medicare Part D. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the manufacturer’s subsidy under this program from 50% to 70% of the negotiated price, beginning January 1, 2019.
Federal Contracting/Pricing Requirements
Manufacturers are also required to make their covered drugs, which are generally drugs approved under NDAs, available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”), of the General Services Administration. The law also requires manufacturers to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases of their covered drugs by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense (“DoD”), the Coast Guard, and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement or purchase of the manufacturer’s drugs under certain federal programs. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies for covered drugs must be no more than the Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”), which is at least 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”) for the prior year. The Non-FAMP is the average price for covered drugs sold to wholesalers or other middlemen, net of any price reductions. The accuracy of a manufacturer’s reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs, or FSS contract prices may be audited by the government. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified federal 
14

agencies based on those inaccuracies. If a manufacturer were found to have knowingly reported false prices, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the law provides for significant civil monetary penalties per incorrect item. Finally, manufacturers are required to disclose in FSS contract proposals all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than the proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, manufacturers are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions.
Tricare Retail Pharmacy Network Program
The DoD provides pharmacy benefits to current and retired military service members and their families through the Tricare healthcare program. When a Tricare beneficiary obtains a prescription drug through a retail pharmacy, the DoD reimburses the pharmacy at the retail price for the drug rather than procuring it from the manufacturer at the discounted FCP discussed above. In order for the DoD to realize discounted prices for covered drugs (generally drugs approved under NDAs), federal law requires manufacturers to pay refunds on utilization of their covered drugs sold to Tricare beneficiaries through retail pharmacies in DoD’s Tricare network. These refunds are generally the difference between the Non-FAMP and the FCP and are due on a quarterly basis. Absent an agreement from the manufacturer to provide such refunds, DoD will designate the manufacturer’s products as Tier 3 (non-formulary) and require that beneficiaries obtain prior authorization in order for the products to be dispensed at a Tricare retail network pharmacy. However, refunds are due whether or not the manufacturer has entered into such an agreement.
Branded Pharmaceutical Fee
A branded pharmaceutical fee is imposed on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, generally drugs approved under NDAs. In each year between 2011 and 2018, the aggregate fee for all such manufacturers ranged from $2.5 billion to $4.1 billion, and will remain at $2.8 billion in 2019 and subsequent years. This annual fee is apportioned among the participating companies based on each company’s sales of qualifying products to or utilization by certain U.S. government programs during the preceding calendar year. The fee became effective January 1, 2011, and is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Utilization of generic drugs, generally drugs approved under ANDAs, is not included in a manufacturer’s sales used to calculate its portion of the fee.
Coverage and reimbursement

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the U.S., private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for drugs and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our drugs unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our drugs. Sales of our drug candidate, and any future drug candidates, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our drug candidate, and any future drug candidates, will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for our drug candidate, and any future drug candidates, will depend significantly on type access to third-party payors’ formularies, prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic drugs can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our drugs to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.

Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and increasingly challenging the prices charged for drugs and services. If these third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our drugs once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drugs once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drugs could reduce or eliminate utilization of our drugs and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and transparency requirements, restrictions on 
15

reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for drugs and services, which could result in reduced demand for our drugs once approved or additional pricing pressures.

Additional regulation

In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in certain other countries that impose similar obligations.

U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations.
