Forward-Looking Statements
 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, as used in this Annual Report, the terms “Altair,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company” and “our business” refer, to Altair International Corp, including its subsidiaries named herein. Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believes,” “project,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.
Overview
 
Altair International Corp. (“Altair”) is a development stage company that was incorporated in Nevada on December 20, 2012. The Company is currently in very preliminary discussions with a number of acquisition targets, each of which we believe would deliver significant value to our shareholders.
 
The Company is currently engaged in identifying and assessing new business opportunities. In this regard, the Company entered into a Mining Lease effective August 3, 2020 with Oliver Geoservices LLC under which the Company received an exclusive lease to mine certain unpatented lode mining claims known as the Walker Ridge located in Elko County, Nevada for a period of five years. The lease can be extended for an additional twenty years if certain extension payments are made within the term of the lease. The Company made an initial payment of $25,000 to secure the lease and is required to make advance royalty payments to maintain its exclusivity commencing December 1, 2020, starting at $25,000 and increasing in $25,000 increments each year for the initial five year term to $100,000 as well as a 3% net smelter fee royalty on all mineral production from the leased property. On April 13, 2022, the Company received a notice of termination from OGS.
 
Earn-In Agreement
 On November 23, 2020, the Company entered into an Earn-In Agreement with American Lithium Minerals, Inc. (“AMLM”) under which we agreed to make total payments of $75,000 to AMLM in exchange for a 10% undivided interest in 63 unpatented placer mining claims comprised of approximately 1,260 acres, and 3 unpatented lode mining claims in Nevada. This $75,000 obligation has been fully satisfied by the Company ($30,000 paid 12/8/2020 and $45,000 paid 1/5/2021), resulting in Altair owning a 10% undivided interest in the claims. The Company has the option to increase its ownership interest by an additional 50% by a total payment of $1,300,648 for exploration and development costs as follows: $100,648 within year one for an additional 10/%, $600,000 in year two for an additional 20% and $600,000 in year three for an additional 20% ownership interest. The Earn-In Agreement grants Altair the exclusive right to explore the properties. In July 2021, the Company undertook a sampling and testing program on the Stonewall lithium project, which returned results showing anomalous lithium content. Further sampling and testing will be required to advance the Stonewall project. Altair is currently exploring the potential of a secondary testing program at greater depth, with sampling to be concentrated in the areas showing the highest grades of lithium. Although, the Company still holds its 10% interest, it has chosen to write down the asset to $0, due to the unknown outcome of planned exploration. The Company incurred a $75,000 impairment expense as a result.

License and Royalty Agreement
 On February 10, 2021, the Company entered into a License and Royalty Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with St-Georges Eco-Mining Corp. (“SX”) and St-Georges Metallurgy Corp. (“SXM”) under which Altair has received a perpetual, non-exclusive license from SX of its lithium extraction technology for Altair to develop its lithium bearing prospects in the United States and SXM’s EV battery recycling technology for which Altair has agreed to act as exclusive master agent to promote the licensing and deployment of the EV battery recycling technology in North America. Altair has agreed to provide SX with a net revenue interest royalty on all metals and minerals extracted (the “Products”) and sold from Altair’s mineral interests in the United States and SX has agreed to provide Altair with a 1% trailer fee on any royalty received by SX from the licensing of the SX EV battery recycling technology to each licensee of the SX EV battery recycling technology referred by Altair or Altair’s sub-agents. Altair will pay a royalty of 5% of the net revenue received by Altair for sales of Products using the lithium extraction technology which decreases to 3% of the net revenue on all payments in excess of US$8,000,000 of production on an annualized basis.
 
Activities of our wholly-owned subsidiary, EV Lithium Solution, Inc. (EVLS)
 On March 19, 2021, EVLS acquired a 100% interest in the IP related to a novel, solid state lithium/graphene battery technology from Cryptosolar Ltd., a Company domiciled in the United Kingdom. We have, and continue to invest in the research and development of this technology, and such development is moving forward rapidly. We are currently in the process of patenting the technology and are exploring options for commercialization. On July 21, 2021, the Company engaged Mr. Matthew Kiang to assist in our efforts to commercialize our battery technology, and on August 6, 2021, the Company filed its first patent application for this technology, which referenced 20 claims. In December, we received a non-final rejection of the claims on various grounds, and we our working with our patent law counsel on a go-forward approach. Our intent is to refine, amend, and re-file our application. In the interim, development and refinement of the technology remains ongoing, with our current largest prototype able to power high-draw outdoor power equipment. The company is currently exploring a secondary patent application for this technology.
