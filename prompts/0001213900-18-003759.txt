Unless the context requires otherwise or unless otherwise stated, references to “our Company,” “Pacific Ventures,” “PACV,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar references refer to Pacific Ventures Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
Pacific Ventures was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 3, 1986, under the name AOA Corporation. On November 12, 1991, the Company changed its name to American Eagle Group, Inc. On October 22, 2012, the Company changed its name to Pacific Ventures Group, Inc.
 
The current structure of Pacific Ventures resulted from a share exchange with Snöbar Holdings, Inc. (“Snöbar”),which was treated as a reverse merger for accounting purposes. On August 14, 2015, Pacific Ventures and its stockholders entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Snöbar Holdings, Inc. (“Snöbar Holdings”), pursuant to which Pacific Ventures acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Snöbar Holdings’ Class A and Class B common stock in exchange for 22,500,000 restricted shares of Pacific Ventures’ common stock, while simultaneously issuing 2,500,000 shares of Pacific Ventures’ restricted common stock to certain other persons, including for services provided and to a former officer of the Company (the “Share Exchange”).As the result of the Share Exchange, Snöbar Holdings. became Pacific Venture’s wholly owned operating subsidiary and the business of Snöbar Holdings became the Company’s sole business operations, and Snöbar Holdings’ majority owned subsidiary, MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation (“MGD”),became indirect subsidiary of Pacific Ventures.
 
Prior to the Share Exchange, the Company operated as an insurance holding company and through its subsidiaries, marketed and underwrote specialized property and casualty coverage in the general aviation insurance marketplace. However, in 1997, after selling several of its divisions, the Company’s remaining insurance operations were placed into receivership and the Company ceased operating its insurance business.
 
Since the Share Exchange represented a change in control of the Company and a change in business operations, the business operations changed to that of Snöbar Holdings and the discussions of business operations accompanying this filing are solely that of Snöbar Holdings and its affiliates and subsidiaries comprising of Snöbar Trust, IPIC, and MGD.
 
Snöbar Holdings was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7, 2013.  Snöbar Holdings is the trustor and sole beneficiary of Snöbar Trust, a California trust (“Trust”), which was formed in June 1, 2013. The current trustee that holds legal title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge, who is the father of Shannon Masjedi, who is the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and majority stockholder. The Trust owns 100% of the shares of International Production Impex Corporation, a California corporation (“IPIC”), which was formed on August 2, 2001. IPIC is in the business of selling alcohol-infused ice cream and ice-pops, and holds all of the rights to the liquor licenses to sell such products and trade names “SnöBar”. As such, the Trust holds all ownership interest of IPIC and its liquor licenses, permitting IPIC to sell its product to distributors, with all income, expense, gains and losses rolling up to the Trust, of which Snöbar Holdings is the sole beneficiary. Snöbar Holdings also owns 99.9% of the shares of MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation (“MGD”). MGD is in the business of selling and leasing freezers and providing marketing services. As a result of the foregoing, Snöbar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of all assets, liabilities and any income received from the business of the Trust and IPIC through the Trust and is the parent company of MGD.
 
The Trust and IPIC are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and Snöbar Holdings is identified as the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification(“ASC”) 810, Snöbar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. As the assessment of Snöbar Holdings’ management is that Snöbar Holdings has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s activities (it is responsible for establishing and operating IPIC), and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE’s economic performance, it was therefore concluded by management that Snöbar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. As such, the Trust and IPIC were consolidated in the financial statements of Snöbar Holdings since the inception of the Trust, in the case of the Trust, and since the inception of Snöbar Holdings, in the case of IPIC.
 
On June 12, 2017, the Company, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire Healthy Foods Markets LLC, a Carson, California based healthy food and grocery retailer. The contemplated acquisition of the business was aimed at creating a fulfillment center for the Snöbar products and to create additional and immediate revenue and exposure for the Company. However, after further consideration and additional due diligence review of the target businesses, the Company determined to rescind the transaction and the related purchase agreements.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 117 West 9th Street, Suite 316, Los Angeles, California. Our main telephone number is (310) 392-5606.

Description of Operations of Snöbar Holdings, Inc.
 
General
 
Snöbar Holdings was incorporated in the state of Delaware on January 7, 2013. Snöbar Holdings is the trustor and sole beneficiary of the Trust, which was formed in June 1, 2013. The trustee that holds legal title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge, who is the father of Mrs. Masjedi, the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and a director. The Trust owns 100% of the shares of IPIC, which was formed on August 2, 2001. IPIC is the owner of liquor licenses and the trade name "SnöBar" and is in the business of selling and distributing alcohol-infused ice creams and ice-pops through its distributors. Snöbar Holdings also owns 99.9% of the shares of MGD. MGD is in the business of selling and leasing freezers and providing marketing services. As a matter of law, IPIC may not be engaged in any business similar to MGD. As a result of the foregoing, Snöbar Holdings is the beneficiary of all assets, liabilities and any income received from the business of IPIC through the Trust and is the parent company of MGD.
 
IPIC is a food, beverage and alcohol distribution company that is initially marketing two products: SnöBar alcohol infused ice pops, and SnöBar alcohol infused ice cream and sorbet.
 
SnöBar ice pops are original frozen alcohol beverage bars, similar to popsicles on a stick, but made with premium liquor such as premium tequila and vodka and are currently manufactured in three flavors, Margarita, Cosmopolitan and Mojito. The alcohol freezing technology used to produce these beverage bars can be applied to almost any alcohol type and mixture, presenting significant market potential and an almost unlimited variety of flavors and employment of premium brands. Each ice pop is the equivalent of a full cocktail. 
 
SnöBar ice cream is an additional innovative product that the company is marketing using proprietary formulas and technology. These products are premium ice cream and sorbets that are distilled spirit cocktails containing up to 15% quality liqueurs and liquors. Currently, there are four flavors available: Brandy Alexander; Brandy Alexander with chocolate chips; Grasshopper; and Pink Squirrel. There are also numerous different liquor ice cream flavors in development in classic ice cream drink styles such as Coffee Liqueur Ice Cream, Piña Colada Sorbet, Sherry Ice Cream, and Strawberry Margarita Sorbet. The product contains ultra-premium dairy and the highest quality of ingredients.
 
What makes the SnöBar products unique is the proprietary formulation and method of manufacturing. SnöBar ice pops and SnöBar ice cream use a system to stabilize the alcohol molecule, whereby the alcohol content, quality and flavor is not degraded during the production process. The technology is also applicable to other food and beverage products such as yogurt, water ice creations and alcohol based goods. IPIC has begun the process of obtaining trade secret and other intellectual property protections as to these unique technologies. The SnöBar brand is fully trademarked within the United States and is currently seeking worldwide trademark rights.
 
SnöBar brand products have been through extensive consumer testing across all age groups and sexes over 21 years of age. According to the results of the consumer testing, there is a large untapped market potential for frozen alcohol desserts. Market research shows that there are very few alcohol infused ice-creams and ice pops available in the U.S. markets and the few that are out there are of lower quality ingredients and are not mass produced. IPIC holds several Federal and State granted liquor licenses. These licenses allow the SnöBar product line to be introduced and distributed in 95% of the United States. IPIC desires to be the first to mass market the SnöBar alcohol-infused products in this untapped and sizeable market segment and capitalize on these two exclusive products. IPIC only uses the finest of ingredients and dairy to produce SnöBar products and strives to achieve the highest quality of texture and taste for all of the SnöBar products. IPIC believes that the SnöBar brand has the potential to scale on a national and international level with worldwide distribution capabilities.
 
As of December 31, 2017, Snöbar products are currently being sold in the east coast by our distributor. The Company’s management has been actively constructing an online platform that will allow Snöbar distribution on a national level. Please see “Plan of Operations” for further detail.
 
Market
 
The alcohol and distilled spirits market, and ice cream markets have consistently exhibited year-over-year growth, and are projected to continue this positive trend. Not only are these products a part of an expanding market segment, but they have been received by a wide range of consumers who find them entertaining and enjoyable to consume. The alcohol beverage and dessert industries are extremely innovative and continuously add new and original products. IPIC has determined that capturing even a small portion of these markets would surpass the initial production capabilities of the SnöBar products and provide a platform for exponential growth nationally and internationally.

In 2012, the SnöBar brand was introduced in the USA in the state of Arizona. The brand was extremely well received and was immediately placed in the top chain stores and restaurants, resorts including Total Wine and the Bevmo Chains. Due to its multiple applications and uses, the SnöBar alcohol infusing technology is used to create exotic and innovative cocktails and the most unique and delicious desserts. SnöBar is one of the only few spirit brands that can offer incremental revenues and not compete with other spirits currently on the market.
 
In 2013, the SnöBar brand was launched in Nevada. Immediately, the SnöBar products were in demand in all the major casinos and resorts. The SnöBar brand joined forces with reputable hotels and resorts, including, but not limited to, the Bellagio, Golden Nugget, Rio, Wynn, Encore, TAO, Caesars Palace, Hilton, The M and MGM. In Nevada, IPIC’s focus is to place the SnöBar brand within all the venues of the hotels including catering and banquets, room service, retail outlets and nightclubs.
 
Immediately following Nevada, the SnöBar brand was launched in the state of Florida, in cities including Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville and the panhandle. This expansion resulted in SnöBar products being offered by reputable hotels and resorts, including, but not limited to, Ritz Carlton Hotel, Fountainbleau, Hilton, Waldorf Astoria and The Breakers Resort.
 
In 2014, the SnöBar brand was launched in California. Over 100 accounts with retailers for SnöBar products were established in the 90 day period following the launch in California. The focus in California has been ensuring that the accounts are reordering product and being serviced and supported properly. Currently, SnöBar products are being offered by Gelson's Markets and there has also been interest from other chains such as Ralph's (Kroger) and Costco.
 
Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, approved the SnöBar brand to be test marketed in a few stores in the Florida market. The first store sold out of more than 10 cases of SnöBar products within the first two weeks prompting an 85 case reorder. After a three month trial period, Walmart approved the expansion of SnöBar products in to more stores in the Florida market.
 
In 2015, the SnöBar brand was launched in North Carolina and South Carolina teaming up with a distributor who is well known in the market place. The brand has been very well received within the market.
 
In the first two months of 2015, IPIC restructured its approach to distribution of SnöBar products and scaled back the operating expenditures by reducing its expenses. Most notably, SnöBar products are now distributed by a local food Distributor in the California markets resulting in almost a 50% decrease in distribution expenses to IPIC.
 
On March 16, 2015, IPIC entered into a contract that allows for exclusive rights to distribute SnöBar products. The contract provides for a minimum of two years with options for extensions to distribute the SnöBar products in South Carolina.
 
In 2017, the South Carolina distributor expanded the account base for SnöBar and has many successful placements for the brand,
 
IPIC continues to actively negotiate with other distributors, both nationally and internationally, for exportation or distribution of SnöBar products to various territories.
 
Ice Cream and Ice Pops
 
While the majority of ice cream sales have long been regular-fat products, ice cream manufacturers continue to diversify their lines of frozen desserts in order to fit into various lifestyles. However, most consumers are looking for an indulgence when eating ice creams, which makes these products well situated with its ideal formula of two enjoyable products, ice cream and alcohol in an affordable combination.
Alcohol
 
The second ingredient in SnöBar ice cream and SnöBar ice pops is alcohol. The U.S. beverage alcohol market is over $400 billion according to The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. The SnöBar alcohol-infused ice cream and ice pop products take advantage of the success of the thriving frozen desserts industry and the successful alcohol beverage industry, making SnöBar ice cream and ice pop products a hybrid of uniqueness conducive to the consumer markets.
Opportunity
 
IPIC has created a proprietary formula and the methodology and manufacturing technique to mass-produce alcohol-infused ice cream leveraging production facilities, warehousing, distribution, and merchandising methods currently used for ice cream. Specifically, the proprietary formulation and manufacturing method stabilize the alcohol molecules from interacting with ice crystals and milk proteins making it possible to mass-produce a solid alcohol-infused ice cream that has a flavoring system of up to 15% distilled spirits. To date, SnöBar ice cream is one of the only products of its kind in the U.S.

The original invention of these frozen alcohol desserts follows the same recipes used by America's finest bars and restaurants. The SnöBar products are distilled spirit cocktails that contain up to 15%quality liqueurs and liquors. What makes liquor ice cream and sorbet different is that the product is solid just like regular ice cream, not semi-soft or in a milk shake consistency like one would find at bars and restaurants: These products are ready-to-eat solid or can be blended into a cocktail. While SnöBar products look like ice cream and frozen popsicles, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”) and Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) have classified SnöBar ice cream and SnöBar pops as distilled spirits due to the alcohol content.
 
Female consumers have generally been high consumers of the dessert market; consequently, males have been the greater consumer of alcohol. The primary target market for these two products is adult women 21 to 45. An alcoholic-infused ice cream drink would appear to combine the best of both worlds for the female consumer. Of course, to a large degree the market for frozen alcohol desserts includes all adults, excluding those who have dietary, medical, or social/religious concerns. This presents an opportunity for a new innovative product that specifically addresses both females and males.
 
IPIC will market and promote the SnöBar brand utilizing a proprietary manufacturing and freezing method where the alcohol content and flavor is not degraded during the production process. SnöBar ice pops are frozen beverage alcohol bars, similar to a popsicle on a stick, and are currently manufactured in three flavors; Margarita, Cosmopolitan, and Mojito. Both recipes include premium liquors of blue agave tequila and vodka, however, the alcohol freezing technology can be applied to almost any alcohol type and mixture, presenting significant market potential and an almost unlimited variety of flavors and employment of premium brands.
 
While SnöBar popsicles are included in the frozen dessert and alcohol beverage category, initially sales are expected to be driven mostly by on-premise accounts. While a core-target audience of females 21 to 65 years old have been highly accepting and positive regarding the product, our market studies show that the actual acceptance band of the product is much wider, and that if cost is not a purchase condition, most people of drinking age will try one or more.
 
With a confidential/proprietary formula and exclusive manufacturing process, coupled with a focused launch and national distribution network, IPIC strives to be the first to market in this unique segment and capitalize on a revolutionary product.
 
Plan of Operations
 
As of the date of this annual report, Snöbar products are currently being sold in the east coast by our distributor. The Company’s management has been actively constructing an online platform that will allow Snöbar distribution on a national level. The Company’s platform is complete and ready to “go live” and, with the aim of purchasing inventory as well as increasing sales and marketing efforts, the Company seeks to raise additional capital to execute on its business plan.  Management anticipates that it will need to raise at least $250,000 in order to purchase sufficient amounts of inventory in order to launch its platform.
 
Our plan of action in the next twelve months is to continue development of the Snobar Product Line and fulfill the current orders that the brand has in hand from our distributor in South Carolina as well as from other accounts.  The Snobar Product Line will have two fulfillment centers to ship the online orders, one in California to service west of the Mississippi and another fulfillment center in South Carolina to service east of the Mississippi. These fulfillment centers are established and ready to proceed as soon as inventory is purchased.
 
The Company’s anticipated general and administrative costs can be expected to increase due to additional marketing costs associated with online sales.  Specifically, the Company expects to utilize marketing and promotions through social media, radio and other avenues to create more brand awareness. We expect to continue to utilize independent contractors and not increase the number of employees. 
 
Strategy
 
The current marketing strategy is to sell products to high-end restaurants, resorts, cruise lines and hotels. Additionally, various celebrity branding and product endorsements are currently being explored. Initially, IPIC will focus on major accounts in four core markets consisting of Southern California, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Miami. The larger vision is to sell products in grocery stores such as Kroger, Wal-Mart and others, and thereafter to begin a national marketing program to all U.S. retailers. It is essentially a top down marketing plan where products are placed with the largest retailer then trickle down to the smallest seller in each market area.
 
The fact that SnöBar products are unique and exclusive, allows SnöBar to bring new consumers and revenue to our vendors, hence creating incremental growth in their overall sales. A national direct mail campaign to liquor retailers and leading food service operators will support these efforts. By SnöBar creating a new vehicle for distilled spirits, many consumers will be tasting liqueurs and liquors for the first time, and in the very favorable mixed medium of premium ice cream.
 
The initial target market for SnöBar popsicles consists of bars, night clubs, restaurants, resorts, hotels, event banquet and catering firms, and cruise lines. Negotiations are currently underway with several more Las Vegas resorts and a major cruise line to initially launch the SnöBar products. Heavy attention will also be given to consumer and trade shows in the beverage industry to provide exposure and sampling as well as to enlist new accounts. IPIC intends to provide SnöBar products to more major groceries stores at a later date.

At the outset, the target consumer is 21 to 45 year olds, predominately females that frequent restaurants, bars, and events on a regular basis. While the consumer demographic is predominantly female, the slight majority of the purchasers are male for female consumption. Our marketing studies and strategy have identified these trends and structured promotional efforts accordingly. IPIC will coordinate and oversee all out-sourced brand awareness and public relations activities. Many of the strategies used will be replications of the past successes experienced by management and other similar demographically-oriented products.
 
MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation (“MGD”), formed in December 14, 2010, a majority owned subsidiary of Snöbar Holdings, is the sole marketer for SnöBar ice cream and SnöBar ice pops.MGD handles all the marketing and promotional aspect for the SnöBar product line.
 
Seasonality
 
While it is anticipated that SnöBar ice cream will be consumed year round with special holiday flavors and promotions planned, it is anticipated that SnöBar consumption will be strong in warm climates, specialty venues, cruise lines, resorts, and of course seasonal occasions.
Raw Materials and Other Supplies
 
The principal raw materials for the production, storage and aging of distilled products are primarily corn and other grains for whiskies and other spirits, agave for tequila, molasses for rum, grapes for cognac, sticks for the popsicles and milk and other dairy products for the ice cream. IPIC does not currently have any long-term supply agreements with third-party suppliers for the purchase of any of raw materials used in our products. From time to time, these raw materials are affected by weather and other forces that may impact production and quality, and, ultimately, their price.
Manufacturing
 
Due to the confidentiality of the SnöBar ice cream and SnöBar formulas and manufacturing processes, IPIC has established a manufacturing agreement with a large frozen dessert manufacturer and packer in Southern California that is large enough to meet initial and all anticipated future demand for the SnöBar brands. The co-packing facility can scale to handle worldwide demand of the SnöBar products. The co-packing facility currently manufactures for such retailers as Trader Joes and Whole Foods.
Inventory
 
IPIC maintains inventory of SnöBar products with the third-party manufacturer/co-packer of its ice-pops and ice creams, as well as with third-party distributors of its products. IPIC's products that are in inventory may be subject to spoliation, theft, or other hazards that could adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations or business of IPIC. While IPIC tries to take precautions to prevent such occurrences, the ice pops, in particular, require refrigeration to a certain temperature that if not maintained can cause the degradation in the products consistency. Ultimate end consumers may not maintain their freezers at the required temperatures which may cause them to believe that there ice-pops have partially melted and therefore they may return the ice-pops, requiring IPIC to reimburse its distributors and take such product back in to inventory for possible disposal. No assurance can be given that individual consumers will be educated in the proper freezing requirements of the SnöBar products.
Distribution
 
In order to scale distribution, SnöBar will partner with more food, beverage and alcohol distributors. The SnöBar products are primarily sold through direct sales forces to distributors. The product delivery will occur through frozen distribution channels. Transportation of the product from the manufacturing facility to customers will be handled by third parties contracted by IPIC. IPIC is utilizing frozen warehouse facilities in Los Angeles and Phoenix, and accounts in Las Vegas and Miami will be shipped directly to the distributor.
 
In addition, IPIC may sell the SnöBar products through joint ventures with and global or regional duty-free customers. IPIC may also sell the SnöBar products through governmental liquor authorities in jurisdictions where aspects of the purchase and distribution of products that contain alcohol are under government control. Examples of such authorities are the eighteen "control" states (and one county) in the United States and the Liquor Control Boards in Canada.
 
Trademarks
 
IPIC sells the SnöBar products under a number of trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to its continued success. The SnöBar brand is fully trademarked within the United States. IPIC’s business could be adversely affected by the loss of any major brand or by material infringement of its intellectual property rights. The SnöBar products are also subject to intellectual property risks because existing trademark laws offer only limited protection, and the laws of some countries in which the SnöBar products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not fully protect the SnöBar products from infringement by others.

Competition
 
The global distilled spirits industry is very competitive, and the dessert industry is very competitive. The SnöBar products compete on the basis of product quality, brand image, price, service and innovation in response to consumer preferences. While the industry is highly fragmented, major competitors on the alcohol-side of the business include Brown-Forman Corporation, Diageo PLC, Beam, Inc., Pernod Ricard S.A., Bacardi Limited, Davide Campari Milano-S.P .A., Remy Cointreau S.A., and Constellation Brands, Inc. and major competitors on the dessert-side of the business include such premium brands as Häagen Dazs and Dreyer's, which are owned by Nestle and Ben and Jerry's which is owned by Unilever.
Regulatory Environment
 
The production, storage, transportation, distribution and sale of the SnöBar products are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities. Various countries and local jurisdictions prohibit or restrict the marketing or sale of products containing alcohol in whole or in part.
 
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulates the U.S. spirits industry with respect to production, blending, bottling, sales, advertising, and transportation of industry products. Also, each state in the United States regulates the advertising, promotion, transportation, sale, and distribution of such products. Many of the key markets for IPIC’s business, distilled spirits are subject to federal excise taxes and/or customs duties, as well as state/provincial, local and other taxes. Sales of products containing alcohol could be adversely impacted by increases to excise tax rates, which are considered from time to time by U.S. states and municipalities and in other key markets for IPIC’s business. The effect of any future excise tax increases in any jurisdiction cannot be determined, but it is possible that any future excise tax increases could have an adverse effect on IPIC’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Environmental Matters
 
IPIC is subject to both U.S. and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. In the U.S., the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and Superfund (the environmental program established in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act to address abandoned hazardous waste sites), which imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party.
Recent Developments and Initiatives
 
On January 31, 2018, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "APA”) with Royalty Foods, LLC, a Nevada limited liability corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Royalty Foods"), and San Diego Farmers Outlet, Inc., a California corporation ("SDFO"). Pursuant to the APA, at the closing of the transactions contemplated therein (the "Closing"), Royalty Foods will acquire substantially all of the operating assets and assume certain liabilities of SDFO (the "SDFO Acquisition"). SDFO is a wholesale and retail seller of fresh produce, groceries, meals, food and other food-related goods. SDFO was founded in 2002 and is located in San Diego, California.
 
The Closing is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others, SDFO’s material performance or compliance with obligations and covenants required by the APA, SDFO’s delivery to the Company and the Company's satisfaction upon review of certain due diligence items, the Company successfully securing financing to complete the SDFO Acquisition (the "Financing"), and SDFO’s execution of Ancillary Agreements (as defined below). At Closing, upon satisfaction of each of the closing conditions set forth in the APA, Royalty Foods shall acquire those properties, rights, contracts, claims and assets of SDFO (defined in the APA as the "Transferred Assets"), and assume certain liabilities of SDFO (defined in the APA as the "Assumed Liabilities"). The total consideration to be paid by the Company to SDFO in connection with the SDFO Acquisition will be $1,050,000 in cash, subject to inventory, accounts payable, accounts receivable and other true-up adjustments as set forth in the APA.
 
The parties to the APA made certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements that are customary for transactions of this nature (including non-compete, non-solicitation of employees and no solicitation of an alternative transaction covenants), agreed to certain indemnification terms as set forth in the APA and agreed to enter into certain agreements in connection with the SDFO Acquisition (the "Ancillary Agreements").
 
There can be no assurance that the Financing and the SDFO Acquisition will be consummated or as to the date by which the SDFO Acquisition may be consummated, if at all.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, Pacific Venture has one full time employee (CEO) who manages the affairs of the corporation. On an as needed basis, the Company hires independent contractors to perform specific tasks related to the Company’s business interests.
