ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (also referred to as Alnylam, we, our or us) is a global commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on ribonucleic acid interference, or RNAi. RNAi is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for sequence-specific silencing and regulation of gene expression. By harnessing the RNAi pathway, we have developed a new class of innovative medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics. RNAi therapeutics are comprised of small interfering RNA, or siRNA, and function upstream of conventional medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA, or mRNA, that encode for proteins implicated in the cause or pathway of disease, thus preventing them from being made. We believe this is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with rare and prevalent diseases. To date, our efforts to advance this revolutionary approach have yielded the approval of four first-in-class RNAi-based medicines, ONPATTRO® (patisiran), GIVLAARI® (givosiran), OXLUMO® (lumasiran) and Leqvio® (inclisiran). 
Our research and development strategy is to target genetically validated genes that have been implicated in the cause or pathway of human disease. We utilize a N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) conjugate approach or lipid nanoparticle (LNP) to enable hepatic delivery of siRNAs. For delivery to the central nervous system, or CNS, and the eye (ocular delivery), we are utilizing an alternative conjugate approach based on a hexadecyl (C16) moiety as a lipophilic ligand. During 2021, we also advanced approaches for lung, muscle and adipose tissue delivery of siRNAs. Our focus is on clinical indications where there is a high unmet need, a genetically validated target, early biomarkers for the assessment of clinical activity in Phase 1 clinical studies, and a definable path for drug development, regulatory approval, patient access and commercialization.
Based on our track record of setting and exceeding five-year goals, in 2021, we launched our Alnylam Px25 strategy which focuses on our planned transition to a top five biotech company, as measured by market capitalization, by the end of 2025. With Alnylam P5x25, we aim to deliver transformative rare and prevalent disease medicines for patients around the world through sustainable innovation, while delivering exceptional financial performance. Specifically, we intend to end 2025 with the following profile:
Patients: Over 0.5 million on our RNAi therapeutics globally
Products: Six or more marketed products in rare and prevalent diseases
Pipeline: Over 20 clinical programs, with 10 or more in late stages and four or more INDs per year
Performance: ≥40% revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate) through YE 2025
Profitability: Achieve sustainable non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) profitability within the period 
We ended 2021 making meaningful progress towards these goals, with four marketed products and 13 clinical programs, including five in late-stage development, across four Strategic Therapeutic Areas, or “STArs:” Genetic Medicines; Cardio-Metabolic Diseases; Hepatic Infectious Diseases; and CNS/Ocular Diseases. Three of our marketed products are within the Genetic Medicines STAr, ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. ONPATTRO is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis, in adults and has also been approved in the European Union, or EU, for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy, in Japan for the treatment of transthyretin, or TTR, type familial amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, and in multiple additional countries, including Brazil. Regulatory filings in other territories are pending and additional filings are planned for 2022 and beyond. GIVLAARI is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with acute hepatic porphyria, or AHP, in the EU for the treatment of AHP in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, and in several additional countries, including Brazil, Canada, Switzerland and Japan. We have also filed for regulatory approval for givosiran (the non-branded drug name for GIVLAARI) in Colombia and additional regulatory filings are pending or planned for 2022 and beyond. In November 2020, we received regulatory approval for OXLUMO in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1, or PH1, in all age groups. In June 2021, we received marketing authorization approval for OXLUMO in Brazil for the treatment of PH1 in both children and adult patients. Regulatory filings in other territories are pending and additional filings are planned for 2022 and beyond. 
Our fourth product, Leqvio (inclisiran), is being developed and commercialized by our partner Novartis AG, or Novartis, and has received marketing authorization from the European Commission, or EC, for the treatment of adults with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia and is in the Cardio-Metabolic Diseases STAr. With respect to regulatory review by the FDA of the NDA filed with the FDA for inclisiran, the FDA issued a complete response letter on December 18, 2020, due to unresolved facility inspection-related conditions at a third-party manufacturing facility in Europe. In July 2021, Novartis announced that the resubmission to the FDA for the inclisiran NDA to address the complete response letter was filed, and listed its own site in Schaftenau, Austria, as the manufacturing location for the final finished product within its NDA resubmission. In December 2021, Leqvio was approved by the FDA as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HeFH, or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or ASCVD, who require additional lowering of LDL-C. As of January 2022, Leqvio has been approved in more than 50 countries.

In addition to our marketed products, we have five late-stage investigational programs advancing toward potential commercialization. These programs include our wholly owned programs: lumasiran (the non-branded name for OXLUMO) for the treatment of advanced PH1 and recurrent renal stones; patisiran (the non-branded drug name for ONPATTRO) for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis, with cardiomyopathy; vutrisiran for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis and Stargardt Disease; as well as fitusiran for the treatment of hemophilia, which is being advanced by our partner Genzyme Corporation, a Sanofi company, or Sanofi, and cemdisiran for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases, which is being advanced by our partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, in a Phase 3 study of cemdisiran and pozelimab combination in myasthenia gravis.
In further support of our Alnylam P5x25 strategy and in view of our evolving risk profile, we remain focused on continued evolution of our global infrastructure, including key objectives such as optimizing our global structure for execution in key markets, enhancing performance consistent with our values, and continuing to strengthen our culture. We maintain focus on our global compliance program to drive its evolution and enhancement in view of the Alnylam Px25 strategy. Building from our global Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our compliance program is designed to empower our employees and those with whom we work to execute on our strategy consistent with our values and in compliance with applicable laws. Comprised of components such as risk assessment and monitoring; policies, procedures, and guidance; training and communications; dedicated resources; and systems and processes supporting activities such as third party relationships and investigations and remediation; our program and related controls are built to enhance our business processes, structures, and controls across our global operations.
Based on our expertise in RNAi therapeutics and broad intellectual property estate, we have formed alliances with leading pharmaceutical and life sciences companies to support our development and commercialization efforts, including Regeneron, Novartis (which acquired our partner The Medicines Company, or MDCO, in 2020), Sanofi, Vir Biotechnology, Inc., or Vir, Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (acquired by Novo Nordisk A/S, or Novo Nordisk, in December 2021), or Dicerna, and PeptiDream, Inc., or PeptiDream.
The COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. More recently, other, more infectious, variants of COVID-19 have been identified, which continue to spread throughout the U.S. and worldwide. We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Since the onset of the global pandemic in 2020, we have been closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and its variants, and plan to continue taking steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions taken by governmental and health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing a temporary global work from home policy in March 2020 for all employees who were able to perform their duties remotely and temporarily restricting all nonessential business travel, and we expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, the patients we serve and other business partners in light of COVID-19 and variants thereof. Where and to the extent permitted to be open under local regulations, our office sites are operational with appropriate safety precautions based on vaccination rates and local guidance, and in October 2021, we formally re-opened our offices in the U.S., following openings in other territories, to those employees who have been fully vaccinated. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve and, at this time, we cannot predict when certain restrictions that remain in place to protect our employees, customers and patients will no longer be needed. Recognizing that local conditions vary for our offices around the world and that the trajectory of the virus continues to be uncertain, we may adjust our plans for employees returning to our offices as deemed necessary. Since early 2021, global vaccination efforts have been underway to control the pandemic. However, due to the speed and fluidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the emergence of highly contagious variants, we do not yet know the full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent the further spread, including the effectiveness of vaccination and booster vaccination campaigns, among others. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial flexibility and continue to monitor developments as we deal with the disruptions and uncertainties from a business and financial perspective relating to COVID-19 and variants thereof. We will continue to work diligently with our partners and stakeholders to support patient access to our approved medicines, advance our product candidates under regulatory review as well as in our clinical studies to the extent safe to do so for patients, caregivers and healthcare practitioners, and ensure the continuity of our manufacturing and supply chain. For additional information related to the actual or potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business, please read Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

RNAi Therapeutics – A New Class of Innovative Medicines
Overview of RNAi Therapeutics
In recent years, a tremendous amount of progress has been made in effectively delivering RNAi therapeutics to targeted organs and cells, and we believe Alnylam has been the leader of this advancement. We believe this success will enable us to achieve our Alnylam P5x25 strategy under which we expect to sustainably and organically create and commercialize transformative rare and prevalent disease medicines benefiting hundreds of thousands of patients around the world while delivering strong financial performance, resulting in a leading biotech profile by the end of 2025.
Early efforts focused on delivery of RNAi therapeutics utilizing LNPs, where siRNA molecules are encapsulated in specific lipid-based formulations. This technology enables systemic delivery with intravenous drug administration and is associated with potent, rapid and durable target gene silencing and an encouraging tolerability profile in clinical studies conducted to date, as well as in our commercial experience. Our first commercial product, ONPATTRO, is formulated utilizing LNPs.
In parallel, we have advanced proprietary technology that conjugates a sugar molecule called GalNAc to the siRNA molecule. This simpler delivery approach enables more convenient, subcutaneous administration of our drug candidates directed to liver expressed target genes, a key aspect of our platform. Results from our Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry, or ESC, GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform have demonstrated a durability of effect that we believe, based on our clinical results, supports once-monthly, once-quarterly, and in some cases, bi-annual subcutaneous dose regimens. Due to this increased potency and durability, as well as a wide therapeutic index, this conjugate platform has become our primary approach for drug development and is leveraged and we believe, strongly validated by, GIVLAARI, OXLUMO, and Leqvio, our more recently approved medicines. Our next generation Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry-Plus, or ESC+, GalNAc-conjugates utilize advanced design features to further improve specificity, while maintaining potency and durability, further improving our already wide therapeutic index by up to six-fold. Our first wave of investigational RNAi therapeutics based on this ESC+ design, zilebesiran (formerly ALN-AGT), ALN-HBV02 and ALN-HSD, are in the clinic, with what we believe are encouraging initial results.
Our platform enhancements have also provided a strong foundation for pursuing a conjugate-based approach to extrahepatic delivery, including delivery to the brain and spinal cord, as well as ocular delivery. During 2021, we presented data utilizing an alternative conjugate approach based on a hexadecyl (C16) moiety as a lipophilic ligand, with proof-of-concept, or POC, demonstrated in rodent and non-human primates. C16 conjugates provide robust CNS knockdown with wide biodistribution and long duration of action, and this technology enabled our landmark collaboration with Regeneron for the advancement of RNAi therapeutics for a broad range of diseases by addressing therapeutic targets in the eye and CNS, in addition to a select number of targets in the liver. We are continuing to advance other extrahepatic delivery approaches, including delivery to muscle and adipose cells, as well as lung delivery. In addition, we are exploring peptide and antibody-based approaches for targeted siRNA delivery to new tissues, and in 2021 we entered into a license and collaboration agreement 
8


with PeptiDream to discover and develop peptide-siRNA conjugates for targeted delivery of RNAi therapeutics to a broader range of extrahepatic tissues. 
In 2021, we unveiled our IKARIA™ platform harboring further chemistry advancements that enables robust target knockdown with an annual dosing regimen. We also unveiled an additional technology platform, GEMINI™, that we believe has the potential to simultaneously silence two unique gene transcripts using a single chemical entity. We believe that this platform, could have potential applications in cardiometabolic, CNS, oncologic, and viral diseases.
Finally, we continue to leverage human genetics to advance our efforts to bring innovative medicines to patients. We have established a relationship with the UK BioBank to support the sourcing of novel, genetically validated targets and secure access to databases of genetic information. In 2021, we furthered this effort through our partnership with Our Future Health to support the design and delivery of the research program to recruit up to five million adults from across the UK. Coupled with our proven ability to uncover novel gene targets, we believe our approach, investments and commitment to genetically validated targets has the potential to increase our success rate, streamline clinical trials and speed the development of precision medicines for patients with both rare and prevalent diseases. 
We believe RNAi therapeutics represent a simplified and efficient new class of innovative medicines. We have achieved human POC in multiple clinical trials of our investigational candidates and now have four commercially approved products, validating our approach to drug development. Moreover, we believe that our reproducible and modular platform will support our Alnylam P5x25 strategy under which we expect to sustainably and organically create and commercialize transformative rare and prevalent disease medicines benefiting hundreds of thousands of patients around the world while delivering strong financial performance, resulting in a leading biotech profile by the end of 2025.

Our TTR Franchise
About Transthyretin Amyloidosis (ATTR) 
ATTR amyloidosis is a rare, serious, life-threatening, multisystem disease encompassing hATTR amyloidosis and wild-type ATTR, or wtATTR, amyloidosis, which result from either hereditary (genetic mutation in TTR gene) or nonhereditary (ageing) causes, respectively. In ATTR amyloidosis, misfolded TTR proteins accumulate as amyloid fibrils in multiple organs and tissue types. hATTR amyloidosis can include sensory and motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy and cardiac symptoms and is a major unmet medical need with significant morbidity and mortality, affecting approximately 50,000 people worldwide. The median survival is 4.7 years following diagnosis, with a reduced survival (3.4 years) for patients presenting with cardiomyopathy. wtATTR amyloidosis predominantly manifests as cardiomyopathy and heart failure symptoms, although patients may experience other manifestations due to extra-cardiac amyloid deposition. The disease is estimated to impact 200,000 to 300,000 people worldwide.
ONPATTRO (patisiran) – hATTR Amyloidosis with Polyneuropathy
ONPATTRO (patisiran) is an intravenously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting TTR. It is designed to target and silence TTR mRNA, thereby blocking the production of TTR protein before it is made. ONPATTRO blocks the production of TTR in the liver, reducing its accumulation in the body’s tissues in order to halt or improve the progression of the polyneuropathy associated with the disease.
ONPATTRO is the first ever FDA-approved RNAi therapeutic and our first product to receive marketing approval. In the U.S. and Canada, ONPATTRO is indicated for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults. In the EU, Switzerland, Brazil and Israel, ONPATTRO is indicated for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adults with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy, and in Japan, ONPATTRO is indicated for the treatment of TTR type familial amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Regulatory filings in other territories are currently under review and additional filings are planned for 2022.
Patisiran (the non-branded name for ONPATTRO) is also being investigated in a Phase 4 study in patients with polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis due to a T60A or V122I variant.
Patisiran – ATTR Amyloidosis with Cardiomyopathy 
Patisiran has received Orphan Drug Designations in the U.S., EU and Japan; specific Orphan Drug Designations vary by country/region.
Patisiran is being investigated in patients with ATTR amyloidosis (wild-type or hereditary) with cardiomyopathy in the ongoing APOLLO-B Phase 3 study.
APOLLO-B Phase 3 Study
In September 2019, we initiated APOLLO-B, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of patisiran in patients in ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy. The study enrolled 360 adult patients with confirmed cardiomyopathy and medical history of symptomatic heart failure due to ATTR amyloidosis, with enrollment completed in the second quarter of 2021. Patients were randomized 1:1 to patisiran or placebo. Concomitant use of on-label commercially available tafamidis is not prohibited, but is capped at 30 percent at baseline. After 12-months of treatment, the primary endpoint of change from baseline in six-minute walk test will be evaluated, as well as other key secondary and exploratory endpoints. Topline results are expected in mid-2022.
Vutrisiran – ATTR Amyloidosis and Stargardt Disease
Vutrisiran is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting TTR in development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis (wild-type or hereditary). It is designed to target and silence TTR mRNA, thereby blocking the production of wild-type and mutant TTR protein before it is made, in the liver. Quarterly, and potentially biannual, administration of vutrisiran may help to reduce the deposition and facilitate the clearance of TTR amyloid deposits in tissues like the nerves, heart and gastrointestinal tract; this reduction and clearance may potentially restore function. In April 2021, we reported positive 9-month results from our HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, and based on these positive data, we submitted an NDA with the FDA for the approval of vutrisiran for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults. In June 2021, the FDA accepted our NDA submission for review for vutrisiran, with an action date set for April 14, 2022 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA. In September 2021, we submitted a marketing authorisation application, or MAA, to the EMA. Vutrisiran is also under regulatory review by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, or ANVISA and Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, in Japan. To date, vutrisiran has received both U.S. and EU Orphan Drug Designations; specific Orphan Drug Designations indications vary by country/region.
HELIOS-A Phase 3 Study
Initiated in late 2018, the HELIOS-A Phase 3 trial is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 study in hATTR amyloidosis patients. The study enrolled 164 patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy at 57 sites in 22 countries. Patients were randomized 3:1 to receive either a 25 mg subcutaneous injection of vutrisiran once every three months or 0.3 mg/kg intravenous infusion of patisiran once every three weeks as a reference comparator for 18 months. The primary endpoint is the mean change from baseline in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7, or mNIS+7, at nine months as compared to the external placebo control arm of the previously completed APOLLO Phase 3 study of patisiran, upon which the approval of ONPATTRO was based. The two secondary endpoints at nine months are changes in quality of life assessed by the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy, or Norfolk QoL-DN, score and gait speed assessed by the timed 10-meter walk test, both compared to external placebo. Changes from baseline in NT-proBNP were evaluated as an exploratory endpoint at nine months. Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints were evaluated at 18 months. In addition, following the 18-month treatment period, all patients are eligible to receive vutrisiran for an additional 18 months as part of the randomized treatment extension where they will receive either 25mg vutrisiran once quarterly or 50mg vutrisiran once every six months. 
◦Efficacy and Safety Results: 
In April 2021, we reported positive 9-month results from our HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The 9-month results achieved the study’s primary endpoint, with vutrisiran showing improvement in the mean change from baseline in mNIS+7 as compared to external placebo data from the APOLLO Phase 3 study of patisiran. At 9 months, vutrisiran also met all secondary endpoints, demonstrating improvement in quality of life as assessed by the Norfolk QoL-DN instrument and improvement in gait speed as assessed by the timed 10-meter walk test, both compared to the external placebo group. The majority of patients 
experienced improvement in neuropathy and in quality of life, both relative to baseline, showing the potential for vutrisiran to reverse polyneuropathy manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis. Vutrisiran also demonstrated an encouraging safety profile with no drug-related discontinuations or deaths. There were two study discontinuations (1.6 percent) due to adverse events in the vutrisiran arm by month nine, both due to deaths, neither of which were considered related to study drug. There were two serious adverse events, or SAEs, deemed related to vutrisiran by the study investigator, consisting of dyslipidemia and urinary tract infection. Treatment emergent adverse events, or AEs, occurring in 10 percent or more patients included diarrhea, pain in extremity, fall and urinary tract infections, with each of these events occurring at a similar or lower rate as compared with historical placebo. Injection site reactions were reported in five patients (4.1 percent) and were all mild and transient. There were no safety signals regarding hematology, renal function or liver function tests. Based on these positive data, in April 2021, we submitted an NDA with the FDA for the approval of vutrisiran for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults, with an action date under PDUFA of April 14, 2022. Vutrisiran is also under regulatory review by the EMA, ANVISA and PMDA.
In January 2022, we reported positive 18-month results from the HELIOS-A study. At 18 months, the study met all secondary endpoints measured, including statistically significant improvements in neuropathy as measured by mNIS+7, quality of life, gait speed, nutritional status and overall disability, relative to external placebo data from the APOLLO Phase 3 study of patisiran. Vutrisiran continued to demonstrate halting or reversal of polyneuropathy, with improvements in neuropathy impairment and quality of life relative to baseline. The final secondary endpoint, reduction in serum TTR levels with vutrisiran, demonstrated non-inferiority relative to the within-study patisiran arm, as expected. Vutrisiran achieved a rapid and sustained reduction of serum TTR at 18 months, with a mean reduction from baseline of 88 percent. In addition, patients treated with vutrisiran showed improvements in exploratory endpoints, including the biomarker NT-proBNP and certain echocardiographic parameters, relative to placebo, and an improvement in technetium uptake relative to baseline in a majority of patients in a planned cohort, providing potential evidence for reduced cardiac amyloid burden and for vutrisiran to improve cardiac manifestations of disease. Vutrisiran continued to demonstrate an encouraging safety and tolerability profile. There were three study discontinuations (2.5 percent) due to AEs in the vutrisiran arm during the 18-month treatment period; one due to a non-fatal event of heart failure and two due to deaths, neither of which was considered related to the study drug. During the 18-month treatment period, there were two SAEs deemed related to vutrisiran by the study investigator, consisting of dyslipidemia and urinary tract infection. The two deaths and the two related SAEs were previously reported in the 9-month topline results. Treatment emergent AEs occurring in 10 percent or more patients included fall, pain in extremity, diarrhea, peripheral edema, urinary tract infection, arthralgia and dizziness; with the exception of pain in extremity and arthralgia, each of these events occurred at a similar or lower rate as compared with external placebo. Injection site reactions were reported in 5 patients (4.1 percent) and were all mild and transient. There were no hepatic safety concerns.
HELIOS-B Phase 3 Study
The HELIOS-B Phase 3 trial, initiated in late 2019, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vutrisiran in patients with ATTR amyloidosis (wild-type or hereditary) with cardiomyopathy. Patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive 25 mg of vutrisiran or placebo administered as a subcutaneous injection once every three months for up to 36 months. The primary endpoint will evaluate the efficacy of vutrisiran versus placebo on the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and recurrent cardiovascular events at 30 months. Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints will also be evaluated. Concomitant use of on-label commercially available tafamidis is not prohibited. The study protocol includes an optional interim efficacy analysis to be conducted at our discretion. In August 2021, we announced full patient enrollment in the HELIOS-B study. Enrollment was completed significantly ahead of schedule, with 655 ATTR amyloidosis patients across 123 activated sites in 33 countries. Topline results from the HELIOS-B study are expected in early 2024.
Potential Opportunity in Stargardt Disease
Based on the data from the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study, we believe there may be a near term opportunity for vutrisiran as an investigational RNAi therapeutic for the potential treatment of Stargardt Disease. Stargardt Disease is a rare, inherited form of blindness caused by accumulation of toxic vitamin A metabolites in the retina which leads to central vision loss. It is a leading cause of blindness from inherited retinal diseases in children, and almost all people affected by this disease become legally blind as adults. Stargardt Disease is estimated to affect about 65,000 people in the U.S. and EU (incidence of approximately 1 in 8,000-10,000), with high unmet medical need and no approved treatments.
TTR functions as a transporter of vitamin A in the blood. It forms a complex with retinol binding protein, or RBP4, to deliver vitamin A to extrahepatic tissues, including the eye. In healthy individuals, the protein ABCA4 acts as a transporter for vitamin A in the eye, ensuring that toxic vitamin A metabolites do not accumulate in the retina. In contrast, patients with Stargardt Disease have an inherited defect in ABCA4. As a result, toxic vitamin A metabolites accumulate in the retina as lipofuscin, triggering degeneration of macular rods and cones, leading to central vision loss and eventually blindness in most patients.
We believe that RNAi-mediated serum TTR reduction with vutrisiran has the potential to reduce RBP4-mediated delivery of vitamin A to the eye and could prevent lipofuscin accumulation and resulting macular damage. Data from the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran have demonstrated a high correlation between serum TTR reduction and vitamin A reduction, supporting the therapeutic hypothesis.
We plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in patients with Stargardt Disease in late 2022, following discussions with health agencies.
Our Other Marketed Products
GIVLAARI (givosiran) — Acute Hepatic Porphyria (AHP)
GIVLAARI (givosiran) is our second approved RNAi therapeutic and the world’s first-ever GalNAc-conjugate RNA therapeutic to be approved. GIVLAARI works by specifically reducing induced liver aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 mRNA, leading to reduction of toxins associated with attacks and other disease manifestations of AHP. In the U.S., GIVLAARI (givosiran) injection for subcutaneous use is approved for the treatment of adults with AHP. GIVLAARI was reviewed by the FDA under Priority Review and had previously been granted Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug Designations in the U.S. In March 2020, the EC granted marketing authorization in the EU for GIVLAARI for the treatment of AHP in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. GIVLAARI was reviewed under accelerated assessment by the EMA and had previously been granted PRIME and Orphan Drug Designations in the EU. We received additional marketing authorizations for GIVLAARI for the treatment of AHP in adults in Brazil, Canada, and marketing authorizations for GIVLAARI for the treatment of AHP in adults and adolescents in Japan, Argentina and Switzerland. We have also filed for regulatory approval for givosiran (the non-branded drug name for GIVLAARI) in Israel, Taiwan, and Colombia and additional regulatory filings are pending or planned in 2022 and beyond.
AHP refers to a family of ultra-rare, genetic diseases characterized by potentially life-threatening attacks and, for some patients, chronic manifestations that negatively impact daily functioning and quality of life. AHP is comprised of four types: acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, and aminolevulinic acid dehydratase-deficiency porphyria. We estimate there are approximately 3,000 AHP patients diagnosed in the U.S. and EU with active disease. Each type of AHP results from a genetic defect leading to deficiency in one of the enzymes of the heme biosynthesis pathway in the liver. AHP disproportionately impacts women of working and childbearing age, and symptoms of the disease vary widely. Severe, unexplained abdominal pain is the most common symptom, which can be accompanied by limb, back or chest pain, nausea, vomiting, confusion, anxiety, seizures, weak limbs, constipation, diarrhea, or dark or reddish urine. The nonspecific nature of AHP signs and symptoms can often lead to misdiagnoses of other more common conditions such as viral gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome and appendicitis. Consequently, patients with AHP can wait up to 15 years for a confirmed diagnosis. In addition, long-term complications and comorbidities of AHP can include hypertension, chronic kidney disease, or liver disease including hepatocellular carcinoma.
OXLUMO (lumasiran )— Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1)
Our third approved RNAi therapeutic, OXLUMO, is an RNAi therapeutic targeting hydroxyacid oxidase 1, or HAO1, for the treatment of PH1. HAO1 encodes glycolate oxidase, or GO, an enzyme upstream of the disease-causing defect in PH1. OXLUMO works by degrading HAO1 mRNA and reducing the synthesis of GO, which inhibits hepatic production of oxalate, the toxic metabolite responsible for the clinical manifestations of PH1. OXLUMO utilizes our ESC-GalNAc-conjugate technology, which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability and a wide therapeutic index. In November 2020, the EC granted marketing authorization for OXLUMO (lumasiran) for the treatment of PH1 in all age groups, following a positive Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, opinion. OXLUMO was previously granted an Accelerated Assessment and a PRIME Designation by the EMA and an Orphan Designation in the EU. Also, in November 2020, OXLUMO (lumasiran) subcutaneous injection was approved by the FDA for the treatment of PH1 to lower urinary oxalate levels in pediatric and adult patients. OXLUMO was reviewed by the FDA under Priority Review and had previously been granted Breakthrough Therapy, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations. With the approval of OXLUMO, the FDA granted us a pediatric rare disease priority review voucher that entitles us to designate a single new drug application to qualify for a priority review in the future. In June 2021, we received marketing authorization approval for OXLUMO in Brazil for the treatment of PH1 in both children and adult patients, and regulatory filings in other territories are pending and additional filings are planned for 2022 and beyond.
PH1 is an ultra-rare genetic disease that affects an estimated one to three individuals per million in the U.S. and Europe. PH1 is characterized by oxalate overproduction in the liver. The excess oxalate results in the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys and urinary tract and can lead to the formation of painful and recurrent kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis. Renal damage is caused by a combination of tubular toxicity from oxalate, calcium oxalate deposition in the kidneys, and urinary obstruction by calcium oxalate stones. PH1 is associated with a progressive decline in kidney function, which exacerbates the disease as the excess oxalate can no longer be effectively excreted, resulting in subsequent accumulation and deposition of oxalate in bones, eyes, skin, and heart, leading to severe illness and death. Management options prior to availability of OXLUMO were limited to hyperhydration, crystallization inhibitors and, in a minority of patients with a specific genotype, pyridoxine (vitamin B6). These measures do not adequately address oxalate overproduction but instead help to delay inevitable progression to kidney failure and the need for intensive dialysis as a bridge to a dual or sequential liver/kidney transplant. Liver transplantation is the only intervention that addresses the underlying metabolic defect, but is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and life-long immunosuppression. Prior to the approval of OXLUMO, there were no approved pharmaceutical therapies for PH1.
The regulatory approvals of OXLUMO in the U.S. and EU were based on positive results from both the ILLUMINATE-A and ILLUMINATE-B Phase 3 pivotal studies of lumasiran in patients with PH1. We are also conducting ILLUMINATE-C – a global Phase 3 study of lumasiran in PH1 patients of all ages with advanced PH1. In July 2021, we reported positive topline results from the ILLUMINATE-C study, and based on those positive results, in December 2021, we submitted a supplemental NDA to the FDA and Type II Filing Variation to the EMA to support label expansion for OXLUMO for the treatment of advanced PH1.
ILLUMINATE-C
ILLUMINATE-C is a single-arm, open-label, multinational Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of lumasiran in PH1 patients of all ages with severe renal impairment (eGFR ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73m2 or elevated serum creatinine for patients <12 months of age). The study is being conducted at 13 study sites across 10 countries around the world. In December 2020, we completed enrollment in this study. Cohort A enrolled six patients with advanced PH1 who do not yet require dialysis and Cohort B enrolled 15 patients who are hemodialysis-dependent. The dosing regimen is based on weight with three monthly starting doses followed by ongoing monthly or quarterly doses. The primary efficacy endpoint for Cohort A was the percent change in plasma oxalate, or POx, from baseline to month six, and the primary endpoint for Cohort B was the percent change in pre-dialysis POx from baseline to month six. Key secondary endpoints are designed to evaluate additional measures of POx and changes in urinary oxalate, and quality of life assessments. Kidney function, frequency and mode of dialysis, frequency of kidney stone events, and measures of systemic oxalosis, including clinical manifestations will also be evaluated in the extension period of the study.
•Efficacy and Safety Results: At six months, treatment with lumasiran in Cohorts A and B, respectively, led to 33 percent and 42 percent mean reductions in POx and predialysis POx from baseline to month six. Reduction in POx was evident by month one and persisted through the end of the 6-month primary analysis period. Lumasiran also demonstrated positive results across secondary endpoints, including patients in Cohort B achieving substantial reductions in POx area under the curve 0-24h between dialysis sessions from baseline to month six, and lumasiran demonstrating consistent reductions across all measures of urinary oxalate in Cohort A. In addition, a similar magnitude of plasma glycolate increase, an exploratory endpoint in Cohorts A and B, was observed as compared to previously completed studies in patients with relatively preserved kidney function (ILLUMINATE-A and ILLUMINATE-B), suggesting similar pharmacodynamics of lumasiran regardless of kidney function. Mild and transient injection site reactions were the most common drug-related AE reported in 24 percent (5/21) of patients. There were no deaths and no serious or severe AEs related to lumasiran. Furthermore, there were no treatment discontinuations or study withdrawals.
In addition to our ILLUMINATE program, we are evaluating the safety and efficacy of lumasiran in patients with recurrent kidney stone disease in a proof-of-concept Phase 2 study which was initiated in December 2021. The Phase 2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of lumasiran administered subcutaneously in patients with recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stone disease and elevated urinary oxalate levels. The global, multicenter trial is expected to enroll 120 adults with a documented diagnosis of recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stone disease, based on two or more stone events within five years prior to screening, and whose 24-hour urinary oxalate levels are greater than the upper limit of normal. Study participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either placebo or lumasiran at 567 mg or 284 mg on Day 1, Month 3, and Month 9 of a 15-Month double-blind treatment period that includes a six-month primary analysis period followed by a nine-month treatment extension period. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 study is the percent change in 24-hour urinary oxalate after six months of treatment. Key secondary endpoints include the percentage of patients who achieve a 20 percent or greater reduction in 24-hour urinary oxalate and percent change in urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation after six months of treatment. Topline results are expected in mid-2023.
Leqvio (inclisiran) — Hypercholesterolemia
Leqvio, our fourth approved RNAi therapeutic, developed and commercialized by our partner, Novartis, is the first and only siRNA therapy (or RNAi therapeutic) to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (also known as “bad cholesterol” or LDL-C), and is the first RNAi therapeutic approved for a highly prevalent disease. Leqvio is a subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, or PCSK9, to reduce LDL-C levels via an RNAi mechanism of action and could help improve outcomes for patients with ASCVD, a deadly form of cardiovascular disease. In December 2020, following a positive CHMP opinion, the EC granted marketing authorization for Leqvio (inclisiran) for the treatment of adults with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidemia, as an adjunct to diet: in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximally tolerated dose of a statin, or alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated. In December 2021, the FDA approved Leqvio as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with HeFH or clinical ASCVD who require additional lowering of LDL-C. Leqvio has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH. As of January 2022, Leqvio has been approved in more than 50 countries.
Approximately 100 million people worldwide are treated with lipid lowering therapies, predominantly statins, to reduce LDL-C and the associated risk of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke or associated events. However, residual risk for cardiovascular events remains and statins are associated with well-known limitations. First, not all subjects reach LDL-C levels associated with optimal protection against clinical events. Second, not all subjects tolerate statins or are able to take statins at sufficiently-intensive doses. Third, observational studies have demonstrated that >50% of patients do not adhere to statin therapy for more than six months. Despite statins alone or in combination with other lipid lowering medications, current therapies for the management of elevated LDL-C remain insufficient in some subjects. This is particularly true in patients with pre-existing coronary heart disease and/or diabetes or a history of familial hypercholesterolemia who are at the highest risk and require the most intensive management. There is an unmet need for additional treatment options beyond currently-available treatments for lowering of the LDL-C level to reduce cardiovascular risk.
In February 2013, we and MDCO (acquired by Novartis in January 2020) entered into a license and collaboration agreement pursuant to which we granted to MDCO an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize RNAi therapeutics targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases. Following its acquisition of MDCO, Novartis has all of the rights and obligations under the MDCO agreement. A description of the MDCO agreement is included below under the heading “Strategic Alliances and Collaborations.”
Regulatory filings and approvals for Leqvio were based on positive results from the robust ORION clinical development program that included a comprehensive set of clinical trials to assess LDL-C lowering and safety in over 3,600 patients. This Phase 3 program represents the largest clinical program conducted to date for an investigational RNAi therapeutic program. Two additional Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trials, ORION-4 and the Novartis initiated VICTORION-2-PREVENT are currently ongoing.
Additional Late-Stage Clinical Development Programs
Fitusiran — Hemophilia
Fitusiran is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting antithrombin, or AT, for the treatment of people with hemophilia A and B, with and without inhibitors, in collaboration with our partner, Sanofi. Fitusiran is designed to lower levels of AT with the goal of promoting sufficient thrombin generation to prevent bleeding. AT acts by inactivating thrombin and other coagulation factors, and plays a key role in normal hemostasis by helping to limit the process of fibrin clot formation.
Hemophilia is a hereditary bleeding disorder characterized by an underlying defect in the ability to generate adequate levels of thrombin needed for effective fibrin clot formation, thereby resulting in recurrent bleeds into joints, muscles, and major internal organs. Lowering AT in the hemophilia setting may promote the generation of sufficient levels of thrombin needed to form an effective fibrin clot and prevent bleeding. This rationale is supported by human genetic data suggesting that co-inheritance of thrombophilic mutations, including AT deficiency, may ameliorate bleeding in hemophilia. We believe this approach is a unique and innovative strategy for preventing bleeding in people with hemophilia.
There are approximately 200,000 people living with hemophilia A and hemophilia B worldwide. Standard treatment for people with hemophilia currently involves replacement of the deficient clotting factor either as prophylaxis or on-demand therapy, which can lead to a temporary restoration of thrombin generation capacity. However, with current factor replacement treatments people with hemophilia are at risk of developing neutralizing antibodies, or inhibitors, to their replacement factor, a very serious complication affecting as many as one third of people with severe hemophilia A and a smaller fraction of people with hemophilia B. People who develop inhibitors become refractory to replacement factor therapy and are twice as likely to be hospitalized for a bleeding episode.
Fitusiran is currently being evaluated in the ATLAS Phase 3 program. In October 2020, Sanofi announced that it voluntarily paused dosing in all ongoing fitusiran clinical studies to assess reports of non-fatal thrombotic events in patients 
participating in the ATLAS Phase 3 program. Following an assessment of available data and alignment with the FDA, in December 2020, Sanofi announced that it would resume fitusiran dosing in ongoing adolescent and adult clinical studies. Sanofi has since resumed fitusiran dosing in all ongoing studies with protocol amendments to address adjustments to dose and dosing regimen. To allow for the appropriate collection and assessment of safety and efficacy data under the amended protocols with additional lower doses, Sanofi expects that global regulatory submission timelines for the adult and adolescent studies will be delayed, subject to alignment with health authorities, and in October 2021, Sanofi announced that the potential filing date for fitusiran had been moved to 2024. Fitusiran has received both U.S. and EU Orphan Drug Designations for the treatment of hemophilia A and B. 
In December 2021, Sanofi presented positive results from the ATLAS-A/B and ATLAS-INH Phase 3 studies of fitusiran. 
ATLAS-A/B
ATLAS-A/B is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label study investigating the efficacy and safety of fitusiran in males ≥12 years with severe hemophilia A or B without inhibitors who had previously been treated with on-demand factor therapy. Study participants (n=120) were randomized 2:1 to receive either once-monthly 80mg subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis or on-demand factor therapy for bleeding episodes. The primary endpoint is annualized bleeding rate, or ABR.
•Efficacy and Safety Results: All key primary and secondary endpoints were met in ATLAS-A/B. Once-monthly 80mg subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis demonstrated a significant reduction in annualized bleeding rate, annualized spontaneous bleeding rate, and annualized joint bleeding rate (all ~90 percent) in people with severe hemophilia A or B without inhibitors compared with on demand treatment. This reduction in bleeding was associated with a meaningful improvement in health-related quality of life. Reported treatment emergent SAEs were generally consistent with previously identified risks of fitusiran. Treatment emergent SAEs in the fitusiran arm included cholelithiasis (two patients, 2.5 percent), cholecystitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and asthma (one patient each, 1.3 percent). In the fitusiran arm, two patients (2.5 percent) experienced Treatment emergent AEs that resulted in fitusiran discontinuation (cholecystitis and increased alanine aminotransferase). No treatment emergent AEs of thrombosis and no fatal treatment emergent AEs were reported.
ATLAS-INH
The ATLAS-INH study is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fitusiran in males ≥12 years with severe hemophilia A or B with inhibitors to factor VIII or IX. Study participants (n=57) receiving on-demand treatment with bypassing agents, or BPA, were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-monthly 80mg subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis or continue with on-demand BPA. The primary endpoint is ABR. Sanofi is currently investigating the efficacy and safety of fitusiran under an amended protocol which includes lower doses and an extended dosing regimen in all ongoing adult and adolescent studies. 
•Efficacy and Safety Results: In ATLAS-INH, 80mg monthly subcutaneous fitusiran significantly reduced bleeding with a median ABR of zero and significant proportion of people with zero bleeds, resulting in a meaningful improvement in health-related quality of life. Reported treatment emergent SAEs were generally consistent with what is anticipated in an adult and adolescent population with severe hemophilia A or B with inhibitors, or with the previously identified risks of fitusiran. All treatment emergent SAEs were reported in one patient each; in the fitusiran prophylaxis arm these included events of device related infection, hematuria, spinal vascular disorder, subclavian vein thrombosis, thrombosis, acute cholecystitis, chronic cholecystitis and asymptomatic COVID-19. One patient (2.4%) in the fitusiran arm experienced treatment emergent AEs that resulted in study drug discontinuation (spinal vascular disorder and thrombosis). There were no fatal treatment emergent AEs reported.
In January 2018, we and Sanofi entered into an amendment to our 2014 collaboration, as well as the ALN-AT3 Global License Terms, which as further amended in April 2019 are referred to as the A&R AT3 License Terms, pursuant to which Sanofi has global rights to develop and commercialize fitusiran and any back-up products. The 2014 Sanofi collaboration, as amended, as well as the A&R AT3 License Terms, are described below under the heading “Strategic Alliances and Collaborations.”
Early-Stage Clinical Development Programs
Cemdisiran — Complement-Mediated Diseases
Cemdisiran is a subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the C5 component of the complement pathway in development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. The complement system plays a central role in immunity as a protective mechanism for host defense, but its dysregulation results in life-threatening complications in a broad range of human diseases including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, amongst others. 
Cemdisiran is currently being advanced by us as a monotherapy, and topline results from our Phase 2 clinical trial of cemdisiran in patients with IgA nephropathy are expected in early 2022. Cemdisiran is also being evaluated by our partner, Regeneron, in combination with Regeneron’s pozelimab (REGN3918), an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody. In late 2021, 
Regeneron initiated a Phase 3 study of cemdisiran and pozelimab combination in myasthenia gravis, in addition to multiple Phase 2 studies and a Phase 3 study in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
Zilebesiran (formerly ALN-AGT) — Hypertension
Zilebesiran is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting angiotensinogen, or AGT, in development for the treatment of hypertension in high unmet need populations. AGT is the most upstream precursor in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, a cascade which has a demonstrated role in blood pressure regulation and its inhibition has well-established anti-hypertensive effects. Zilebesiran inhibits the synthesis of AGT in the liver, potentially leading to durable reductions in AGT protein and ultimately, in the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
Hypertension is a complex multifactorial disease clinically defined by most major guidelines as a systolic blood pressure of above 140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg. More than one billion people worldwide live with hypertension. In the U.S. alone, approximately 47 percent of adults live with hypertension, with more than half of patients on medication remaining above the blood pressure target level. Despite the availability of anti-hypertensive medications, there remains a significant unmet medical need, especially given the poor rates of adherence to existing daily oral medications and daily peak and trough effects, resulting in inconsistent blood pressure control and an increased risk for stroke, heart attack and premature death. In particular, there are a number of high unmet need settings where novel approaches to hypertension warrant additional development focus, including patients with poor medication adherence, difficult-to-treat and resistant hypertension, and in patients with high cardiovascular risk.
In November 2021, we reported positive interim data from the ongoing Phase 1 study of zilebesiran, and also initiated the KARDIA Phase 2 clinical studies for zilebesiran. KARDIA-1 is designed to evaluate zilebesiran as a monotherapy across different doses administered quarterly and biannually, whereas KARDIA-2 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of zilebesiran administered biannually as a concomitant therapy in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by standard of care antihypertensive medications. 
ALN-HBV02 (VIR-2218) – Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection
ALN-HBV02 (VIR-2218) is a subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the HBV genome for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, which is being advanced by our collaborators at Vir. ALN-HBV02 is designed to inhibit expression of all HBV proteins, including hepatitis B surface antigen. Almost one-third of the world’s population have previous or current HBV infection. Worldwide, more than 250 million people are chronically infected with HBV, and an estimated 1 million people die each year from complications of chronic HBV such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current treatment options include life-long suppressive antiviral therapies. There is a significant need for safe and convenient novel therapeutics that restore the host immune response, leading to control of the virus after a finite duration of therapy, which is the definition of a functional cure.
The safety and efficacy of VIR-2218 are currently being investigated in an ongoing Phase 2 trial. In addition, in 2021, Vir continued to progress a Phase 2 combination trial of VIR-2218 with pegylated interferon-alpha to evaluate the potential for the combination to result in a functional cure for HBV. VIR-2218 is also being explored in additional clinical trials with collaborators of Vir. Vir plans to report additional results from the Phase 2 program in middle and late 2022.
ALN-HSD – Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis
ALN-HSD is a subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting HSD17B13 in development in collaboration with our partner, Regeneron, for the treatment of NASH. NASH is a highly prevalent chronic liver disease characterized by the accumulation fat within hepatocytes, hepatocyte injury, and hepatic inflammation, which can lead to progressive fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Comorbidities include obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Approximately 16 million people in the U.S. live with NASH, with prevalence of the disease increasing due to rising rates of obesity. NASH is projected to be the leading indication for liver transplants in developed countries within the next several years. There are currently no approved medical therapies for NASH.
In 2021, we advanced ALN-HSD into Part B of the ongoing Phase 1 study in patients with NASH.
ALN-APP – Alzheimer’s Disease and Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy
ALN-APP is an investigational, intrathecally administered RNAi therapeutic targeting amyloid precursor protein, or APP, in development in collaboration with Regeneron for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, or AD, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Genetic mutations that increase production of APP or alter its cleavage cause early-onset AD, early-onset CAA, or both. ALN-APP is designed to decrease APP mRNA in the CNS, to decrease synthesis of APP protein and all downstream intracellular and extracellular APP-derived cleavage products, including amyloid beta (Aβ). Reducing APP protein production is expected to reduce the secretion of Aβ peptides that aggregate into extracellular amyloid deposits and reduce the intraneuronal APP cleavage products that trigger the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and cause neuronal dysfunction in AD. ALN-APP is the first program utilizing our C16 conjugate technology, which enables enhanced delivery to cells in the CNS. 
In December 2021, we announced submission of our CTA to The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, in the United Kingdom to initiate a Phase 1 study of ALN-APP, with a plan to initiate the Phase 1 study in patients with early-onset AD in early 2022, upon obtaining MHRA approval. We expect to report topline Phase 1 results in late 2022.
ALN-XDH - Gout
ALN-XDH is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting xanthine dehydrogenase, or XDH, in development for the treatment of gout. Reducing XDH with an RNAi therapeutic is expected to result in potent urate lowering, essential in preventing gout-associated flares and managing the disease. ALN-XDH utilizes our ESC+ GalNAc-conjugate technology, which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased selectivity and a wide therapeutic index.
In December 2021, we announced submission of our CTA to the MHRA in the United Kingdom to initiate a Phase 1/2 study of ALN-XDH in healthy volunteers and in patients with gout in early 2022, upon obtaining MHRA approval. We expect to report topline Phase 1 results in late 2022.
Additional Early-Stage and Pre-clinical Programs
In addition to the programs listed above, we are also advancing other earlier-stage pipeline programs and plan to file two to four investigational new drug applications, or INDs, or CTAs from our organic product engine during 2022. We also intend to continue to build on our progress with extrahepatic delivery during 2022, advancing our eye and CNS programs under our collaboration with Regeneron, as well as continuing to advance other extrahepatic delivery initiatives.
Our Collaboration and Licensing Strategy
Our business strategy is to develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutic products directed towards transformative rare and prevalent diseases, including continued focus on our four STArs. As part of this strategy, we have entered into, and expect to enter into additional, collaboration and licensing agreements as a means of obtaining resources, capabilities and funding to advance our investigational RNAi therapeutic programs.
Our collaboration strategy is to form alliances that create significant value for ourselves and our collaborators in the advancement of RNAi therapeutics as a new class of innovative medicines. Specifically, with respect to our CNS/Ocular Disease pipeline, in April 2019, we entered into a global, strategic collaboration with Regeneron to discover, develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics for a broad range of diseases by addressing disease targets expressed in the eye and CNS, in addition to a select number of targets expressed in the liver. In July 2020, Regeneron exercised its co-development/co-commercialization option on our first CNS-targeted development candidate, ALN-APP, an investigational RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy and autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s Disease, which we are leading. We are also advancing multiple other programs with Regeneron.
With respect to our Cardio-Metabolic pipeline, in March 2013, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license with MDCO (acquired by Novartis in January 2020) pursuant to which MDCO was granted the right to develop, manufacture and commercialize RNAi therapeutics targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases, including inclisiran. In March 2018, we entered into a discovery collaboration with Regeneron to identify RNAi therapeutics for NASH, and potentially other related diseases, and in November 2018, we and Regeneron entered into a separate, fifty-fifty collaboration to further research, co-develop and commercialize any therapeutic product candidates that emerge from these discovery efforts. In April 2020, we entered into a development and commercialization collaboration with Dicerna to advance investigational RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of alpha-1 liver disease. 
With respect to our Hepatic Infectious Disease pipeline, in October 2017, we announced an exclusive licensing agreement with Vir for the development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics for infectious diseases, including chronic HBV infection. In March 2020, we announced an expansion of our exclusive licensing agreement with Vir to include the development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, which we further expanded in April 2020 to include up to three additional targets focused on host factors for SARS-CoV-2, including angiotensin converting enzyme-2, or ACE2, and transmembrane protease, serine 2, or TMPRSS2, and potentially a third mutually selected host factor target. In July 2021, we notified Vir that we elected to discontinue ALN-COV, in development for the treatment of COVID-19, and all other COVID-19 research and development activities, based on a portfolio prioritization in view of the availability of highly effective vaccines and alternative treatment options. Following such discontinuation of COVID-19 related activities, we have no further obligations to work on the COVID-related targets and Vir will have no further rights to such targets under our exclusive licensing agreement.
With respect to our Genetic Medicine pipeline, we formed a broad strategic alliance with Sanofi in 2014. In January 2018, we and Sanofi amended our 2014 collaboration and entered into the Exclusive License Agreement, referred to as the Exclusive TTR License, under which we have the exclusive right to pursue the further global development and commercialization of all TTR products, including ONPATTRO, vutrisiran and any back-up products, and the ALN-AT3 Global License Terms, referred to as the AT3 License Terms, under which Sanofi has the exclusive right to pursue the further global development and commercialization of fitusiran and any back-up products. In April 2019, we and Sanofi agreed to further amend the 2014 Sanofi 
collaboration to conclude the research and option phase and to amend and restate the AT3 License Terms to modify certain of the business terms.
We will continue to evaluate and explore partnership opportunities through collaboration and licensing arrangements, and may enter into new collaborations to advance certain products or disease areas. For example, in January 2022, we announced that we and Novartis agreed to collaborate on the discovery and development of an siRNA-based targeted therapy to restore functional liver cells in patients with end-stage liver diseases.
We also have entered into license agreements to obtain rights to intellectual property in the field of RNAi. In addition, because delivery of RNAi therapeutics has historically been an important objective of our research activities, we have entered into various collaboration and licensing arrangements with other companies and academic institutions to gain access to delivery technologies, including various LNP delivery technologies, and we may enter into such agreements in the future to gain access to products or technologies. For example, in 2021, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with PeptiDream to discover and develop peptide-siRNA conjugates leveraging PeptiDream's proprietary Peptide Discovery Platform System technology.
Strategic Alliances and Collaborations
We have formed, and intend to continue to form, strategic alliances and collaborations to gain access to the financial, technical, clinical and commercial resources necessary to develop and market RNAi therapeutics. We expect these alliances and collaborations to provide us with financial support in the form of upfront cash payments, license fees, equity investments, research, development, and sales and marketing support and/or funding, milestone payments and/or royalties or profit sharing based on sales of RNAi therapeutics. Below is a brief description of our key strategic alliances, financial collaboration and license agreements.

In April 2019, we entered into a global, strategic collaboration with Regeneron to discover, develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics for a broad range of diseases by addressing therapeutic targets expressed in the eye and CNS, in addition to a select number of targets expressed in the liver, which we refer to as the Regeneron Collaboration. The Regeneron Collaboration is governed by a Master Agreement, referred to as the Regeneron Master Agreement, which became effective in May 2019. 
In connection with the Regeneron Master Agreement, we and Regeneron entered into (i) a binding co-co collaboration term sheet covering the continued development of cemdisiran, our C5 siRNA currently in Phase 2 development for C5 complement-mediated diseases, as a monotherapy and (ii) a binding license term sheet to evaluate anti-C5 antibody-siRNA combinations for C5 complement-mediated diseases including evaluating the combination of Regeneron’s pozelimab (REGN3918), currently in Phase 3 development, and cemdisiran. The C5 co-co collaboration and license agreements were executed in August 2019.
Under the terms of the Regeneron Collaboration, we will work exclusively with Regeneron to discover RNAi therapeutics for eye and CNS diseases for an initial five-year research period, subject to extension for up to an additional two years, or the Initial Research Term. The Regeneron Collaboration also covers a select number of RNAi therapeutic programs designed to target genes expressed in the liver, including our previously-announced collaboration with Regeneron to identify RNAi therapeutics for the chronic liver disease NASH. We retain broad global rights to all of our other unpartnered liver-directed clinical and pre-clinical pipeline programs.
Regeneron will lead development and commercialization for all programs targeting eye diseases (subject to limited exceptions), entitling us to certain potential milestone and royalty payments pursuant to the terms of a license agreement, the form of which has been agreed upon by the parties. We and Regeneron will alternate leadership on CNS and liver programs, with the lead party retaining global development and commercial responsibility. 
With respect to the programs directed to C5 complement-mediated diseases, we retain control of cemdisiran monotherapy development, and Regeneron is leading combination product development. Under the C5 co-co collaboration agreement, we and Regeneron equally share costs and potential future profits on any monotherapy program. Under the C5 license agreement, for cemdisiran to be used as part of a combination product, Regeneron is solely responsible for all development and commercialization costs and we will receive low double-digit royalties and commercial milestones of up to $325.0 million on any potential combination product sales. 
We and Regeneron plan to advance programs directed to up to 30 targets under the Regeneron Collaboration during the Initial Research Term. In July 2020, Regeneron exercised its co-development/co-commercialization option on our first CNS-targeted development candidate, ALN-APP, an investigational RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy and autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s Disease, which we are leading. We are also advancing multiple other programs with Regeneron.

Sanofi. In January 2014, we entered into a global, strategic collaboration with Sanofi to discover, develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics as Genetic Medicines to treat orphan diseases, referred to as the 2014 Sanofi collaboration. The 2014 Sanofi collaboration superseded and replaced the previous collaboration between us and Sanofi entered into in October 2012 to develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics targeting TTR for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis, including patisiran and revusiran, in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region.
In January 2018, we and Sanofi entered into an amendment to our 2014 Sanofi collaboration. In connection and simultaneously with entering into the 2018 amendment to the 2014 Sanofi collaboration, we and Sanofi also entered into the Exclusive TTR License and the AT3 License Terms. As a result, we have the exclusive right to pursue the further global development and commercialization of all TTR products, including ONPATTRO, vutrisiran and any back-up products, and Sanofi has the exclusive right to pursue the further global development and commercialization of fitusiran and any back-up products. Under the 2018 amendment and the Exclusive TTR License, Sanofi is eligible to receive (i) royalties up to 25%, increasing over time, based on annual net sales of ONPATTRO in territories excluding the U.S., Canada and Western Europe, provided royalties on annual net sales of ONPATTRO in Japan were set at 25% beginning as of the effective date of the Exclusive TTR License, (ii) tiered royalties of 15% to 30% based on global annual net sales of vutrisiran (consistent with the royalties due to us from Sanofi on fitusiran), and (iii) tiered royalties of up to 15% based on global annual net sales of any back-up products, in each case by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees. The collaboration amendment entered into in April 2019 described below made no changes to the terms described in clauses (i)-(iii) above, which remain in full force and effect.
In April 2019, we and Sanofi agreed to further amend the 2014 Sanofi collaboration to conclude the research and option phase and to amend and restate the AT3 License Terms pursuant to the A&R AT3 License Terms, to modify certain of the business terms. The material collaboration terms for fitusiran were unchanged. Under the A&R AT3 License Terms, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties of 15% to 30% based on global annual net sales of fitusiran and up to 15% based on global annual net sales of any back-up products controlled by Sanofi, in each case by Sanofi, its affiliates and its sublicensees. In connection with entering into the 2019 amendment and the A&R AT3 License Terms, we agreed to advance, at our cost, a selected investigational asset in an undisclosed rare genetic disease through the end of IND-enabling studies. Following completion of such studies, we will transition, at our cost, such asset to Sanofi. Thereafter, Sanofi will fund all potential future development and commercialization costs for such asset. If this asset is approved, we will be eligible to receive tiered double-digit royalties on global net sales.
Novartis AG. In February 2013, we and MDCO entered into a license and collaboration agreement pursuant to which we granted to MDCO an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize RNAi therapeutics targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases. Under the MDCO agreement, we had responsibility for the development of inclisiran until Phase 1 Completion, as defined in the MDCO agreement, at our cost. In late 2015, MDCO assumed responsibility for all development and commercialization of inclisiran, at its sole cost. In January 2020, MDCO was acquired by Novartis and in December 2020, the EC granted marketing authorization for Leqvio (inclisiran) for the treatment of adults with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, following a positive CHMP opinion. In December 2021, Leqvio was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with HeFH or clinical ASCVD as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated dose of statin. For more information regarding the MDCO agreement, including its ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, please read Note 4, Net Revenues from Collaborations, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Vir Biotechnology, Inc. In October 2017, we and Vir entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Vir Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Vir an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize ALN-HBV02 (VIR-2218), for all uses and purposes other than certain excluded fields, as set forth in the agreement. In addition, we granted Vir an exclusive option for up to four additional RNAi therapeutics programs for the treatment of infectious diseases. In March and April 2020, we entered into amendments to the Vir Agreement to expand our collaboration to include the development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, along with three additional targets focused on human host factors for SARS-CoV-2, including ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and potentially a third mutually selected host factor target. We further amended the Vir Agreement in December 2020, such that we were solely responsible for conducting pre-clinical research activities under the pre-clinical development plan at our discretion and sole expense and effective as of July 1, 2020, we were responsible for all pre-clinical development costs incurred under such plan. In July 2021, we notified Vir that we elected to discontinue ALN-COV, in development for the treatment of COVID-19, and all other COVID-19 research and development activities, based on a portfolio prioritization in view of the availability of highly effective vaccines and alternative treatment options. Following such discontinuation of COVID-19 related activities, we have no further obligations to work on the COVID-related targets and Vir will have no further rights to such targets under our exclusive licensing agreement. For more information regarding the Vir Agreement, including its ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, please read Note 4, Net Revenues from Collaborations, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Strategic Financing Collaboration
The Blackstone Group Inc. In April 2020, we entered into a strategic financing collaboration with certain affiliates of Blackstone to accelerate our advancement of RNAi therapeutics. In connection with the collaboration, Blackstone agreed to provide us up to $2.0 billion in financing, including $1.0 billion in committed payments to acquire 50% of royalties and 75% of commercial milestones payable to us in connection with sales of Leqvio, up to $750.0 million in a first lien senior secured term loan, and up to $150.0 million towards the development of vutrisiran and zilebesiran (formerly ALN-AGT) pursuant to the funding agreement finalized in August 2020. In November 2021, Blackstone elected to opt-in to Phase 2 clinical trial funding of zilebesiran, committing to fund, upon meeting certain patient enrollment thresholds, up to $26.0 million. As part of the strategic financing collaboration, Blackstone also purchased an aggregate of $100.0 million of our common stock. Please read Note 5 and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on our transaction with Blackstone, including its ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business.
Other Strategic License Agreements 
Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In April 2020, we and Dicerna (acquired by Novo Nordisk in December 2021) formed a development and commercialization collaboration on investigational RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of alpha-1 liver disease. Under the development and commercialization agreement entered into between the parties, our ALN-AAT02 and Dicerna’s belcesiran (formerly DCR-A1AT), investigational RNAi therapeutics, each in Phase 1/2 development, will be explored for the treatment of alpha-1 liver disease. In addition, in April 2020, we and Dicerna entered into a Patent Cross-License Agreement, pursuant to which each party agreed to cross-license its respective intellectual property related to our lumasiran program and Dicerna’s nedosiran program, each for the treatment of PH.
PeptiDream, Inc. In July 2021, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with PeptiDream to discover and develop peptide-siRNA conjugates to create multiple opportunities to deliver RNAi therapeutics to tissues outside the liver. Through this collaboration, the companies will collaborate to select and optimize peptides for targeted delivery of small siRNA molecules to a wide range of cell types and tissues via specific interactions with receptors expressed on the target cells. Under the terms of the alliance, we will select a set of receptors for PeptiDream’s peptide discovery platform. PeptiDream will select, optimize, and synthesize peptides for each receptor. We will then generate peptide-siRNA conjugates and perform in vitro and in vivo studies to support final peptide selection. For more information regarding the collaboration agreement with PeptiDream, including its ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, please read Note 4, Net Revenues from Collaborations, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Novartis AG. In January 2022, we announced that we and Novartis, entered into a collaboration and license agreement, referred to as the Novartis License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Novartis an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize siRNAs targeting end-stage liver disease, potentially leading to the development of a treatment designed to promote the regrowth of functional liver cells and to provide an alternative to transplantation for patients with liver failure. Under the terms of the collaboration, we will develop and test potential siRNAs using target-specific assays developed by Novartis. Upon identification of a lead candidate, further development and clinical research will be conducted by Novartis. Pursuant to the Novartis License Agreement, we received an upfront fee, and may also receive milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as tiered royalties on the net sales of licensed products ranging from high-single-digit to sub-teen double-digit percentages. For more information regarding the Novartis License Agreement, including its ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, please read Note 4, Net Revenues from Collaborations, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In January 2015, we and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, entered into a second amended and restated strategic collaboration and license agreement, which we further amended in July 2015, or the 2015 Ionis agreement. The 2015 Ionis agreement provides for certain new exclusive target cross-licenses of intellectual property on eight disease targets, providing each company with exclusive RNA therapeutic license rights for four programs, and extended the parties’ existing non-exclusive technology cross-license, which was originally entered into in 2004 and was amended and restated in 2009, through April 2019. Pursuant to the 2015 Ionis agreement, Ionis granted to us an exclusive, low single-digit royalty-bearing license to its chemistry, motif, mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotide therapeutics against four targets. In exchange, we granted to Ionis an exclusive, low single-digit royalty-bearing license to our chemistry, motif, mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotide therapeutics against four targets. Under the original agreement, Ionis licensed to us its patent estate related to antisense motifs and mechanisms and oligonucleotide chemistry for double-stranded RNAi products in exchange for a previously disclosed technology access fee, participation in fees for our partnering programs and future milestone and royalty payments from us for programs that incorporate Ionis’ intellectual property. We have the right to use Ionis’ intellectual property in our development programs or in collaborations and Ionis agreed not to grant licenses under these patents to any other organization for the discovery, development and commercialization of double-stranded RNA products designed to work through an RNAi mechanism, except in the context of a collaboration in which Ionis plays an active role. In turn, in exchange for option fees, and future milestone 
and royalty payments from Ionis for RNAi programs that incorporate certain of our intellectual property, we non-exclusively licensed to Ionis our patent estate relating to antisense motifs and mechanisms and oligonucleotide chemistry to research, develop and commercialize single-stranded antisense therapeutics, single stranded RNAi therapeutics and to research double-stranded RNAi compounds. Ionis also received a license to develop and commercialize double-stranded RNAi drugs targeting a limited number of therapeutic targets on a non-exclusive basis.

Trademarks
We file trademarks to protect our corporate brand and our products. Typically we file trademark applications in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere in the world as appropriate. In addition to multiple pending trademark applications in the U.S. and other major countries, we have registered trademarks in the U.S., including but not limited to Alnylam®, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals® and the Alnylam logo, as well as ONPATTRO® and the ONPATTRO logo, GIVLAARI® and the GIVLAARI logo and OXLUMO® and the OXLUMO logo.
Competition
The pharmaceutical marketplace is extremely competitive, with hundreds of companies competing to discover, develop and market new drugs. We face a broad spectrum of current and potential competitors, ranging from very large, global pharmaceutical companies with significant resources, to other biotechnology companies with resources and expertise comparable to our own, to smaller biotechnology companies with fewer resources and expertise than we have. We believe that for most or all of our drug development programs, there will be one or more competing programs under development at other companies. In some cases, the companies with competing programs will have access to greater resources and expertise than we do and may be more advanced in those programs.
Competition for Our Business in General
The competition we face can be grouped into three broad categories:
•other companies working to develop RNAi and microRNA therapeutic products;
•companies developing technology known as antisense, which, like RNAi, attempts to silence the activity of specific genes by targeting the mRNAs copied from them; and
•marketed products and development programs for therapeutics that treat the same diseases for which we may also be developing treatments.
We are aware of several other companies that are working to develop RNAi therapeutic products. Some of these companies are seeking, as we are, to develop chemically synthesized siRNAs as drugs. Others are following a gene therapy approach, with 
the goal of treating patients not with synthetic siRNAs but with synthetic, exogenously-introduced genes designed to produce siRNA-like molecules within cells.
Companies working on chemically synthesized siRNAs include Marina Biotech, Inc., or Marina, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Arrowhead, and its collaborators Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., or Takeda, Janssen Pharmaceutics, Inc. or Janssen, Horizon Therapeutics PLC, or Horizon, GlaxoSmithKline PLC, or GSK, and Amgen Inc., or Amgen, Quark Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Quark, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, or Roche, Silence Therapeutics plc, or Silence, and its collaborators, AstraZeneca plc, or AstraZeneca, Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceuticals Group Co., and Mallinckrodt plc, Arbutus Biopharma Corp., or Arbutus, Sylentis, S.A.U., or Sylentis, Novo Nordisk and its collaborators, Boehringer Ingelheim, AstraZeneca plc, or AstraZeneca, and Eli Lilly and Company, WAVE Life Sciences Ltd., or WAVE, Silenseed Ltd., Ascletis Pharma Inc., Biomics Biopharma, Avidity Biosciences Inc., Dyne Therapeutics Inc., or Dyne, Atalanta Therapeutics Inc., Sirnaomics Inc., OliX Pharmaceuticals Inc., Phio Pharmaceuticals, BioPath Holding Inc., Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc., or Arcturus, and Ascletis Pharma Inc. Several of these companies have licensed our intellectual property. Benitec Biopharma Ltd., or Benitec, is working on gene therapy approaches to RNAi therapeutics. Companies working on microRNA therapeutics include Regulus Therapeutics, Inc., Rosetta Genomics Ltd., MiNA Therapeutics, Inc, and InteRNA Technologies B.V.
Antisense technology uses short, single-stranded, DNA-like molecules to block mRNAs encoding specific proteins. While we believe that RNAi drugs may potentially have significant advantages over antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, drugs, including greater potency and specificity, others are developing ASO drugs that are currently at a more advanced stage of development than RNAi drugs. For example, Ionis has developed several ASO drugs that have received regulatory approval. Ionis is also developing antisense drugs using ligand-conjugated GalNAc technology licensed from us, and these drugs have been shown to have increased potency at lower doses in clinical and pre-clinical studies, compared with antisense drugs that do not use such licensed GalNAc technology. In addition to Ionis and its collaborators, including Biogen Inc., AstraZeneca, Novartis and Bayer AG, and several other companies have ASO-based product candidates in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development, including Roche, Akcea Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Ionis in October 2020), or Akcea, Antisense Therapeutics, Ltd., Dyne, WAVE and Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.
The competitive landscape continues to expand and we expect that additional companies will initiate programs focused on the development of RNAi therapeutic products using the approaches described above as well as potentially new approaches that may result in the more rapid development of RNAi therapeutics or more effective technologies for RNAi drug development or delivery.
Competing Drugs for Our Marketed Products and Late-Stage Investigational RNAi Therapeutics
ATTR Amyloidosis. Until recently, liver transplantation was the only treatment option for patients with hATTR amyloidosis in the U.S. and in other countries. Only a subset of patients with early-stage disease qualify for this costly and invasive procedure, which carries significant morbidity and risk of mortality. Even following liver transplantation, the disease continues to progress for many patients, presumably due to ongoing deposition of wild-type TTR protein. 
In addition to ONPATTRO, approved treatments for hATTR amyloidosis now include inotersen (TEGSEDI, approved in many countries) and tafamidis (VYNDAQEL/VYNDAMAX, approved in many countries). Indications vary by country/region for each product. We believe that the following approved drugs could compete with ONPATTRO and, if approved, vutrisiran, for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults and for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy if APOLLO-B and/or HELIOS-B is positive and patisiran and/or vutrisiran, respectively, are approved for that indication:

Drug | Company | Drug Description | Phase | Administration/Dosing 
VYNDAQEL (tafamidis meglumine) | Pfizer Inc. | Small molecule drug to stabilize TTR protein | Approved in the EU, Japan and certain countries in Latin America for hATTR polyneuropathy (indication varies by region) | Daily oral capsule 
VYNDAQEL/VYNDAMAX (tafamidis meglumine / tafamidis) | Pfizer Inc. | Small molecule drug to stabilize TTR protein | Approved to treat ATTR cardiomyopathy in the U.S., EU and Japan; (indication varies by region) | Daily oral capsule 
TEGSEDI (inotersen) | Ionis | Anti-sense oligonucleotide, or ASO, to reduce production of TTR Protein | Approved in U.S., EU, Canada and Brazil for hATTR polyneuropathy (indication varies by region) | Weekly subcutaneous injection (SC)

Several investigational drugs also exist, in varying stages of clinical development, for ATTR amyloidosis. We believe that the following drug candidates, if approved, could compete with ONPATTRO and, if approved, vutrisiran, for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults and for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy if APOLLO-B and/or HELIOS-B is positive and patisiran and/or vutrisiran, respectively, are approved for that indication:

Drug | Company | Drug Description | Phase | Administration/Dosing 
Eplontersen (IONIS-TTR-LRx) | Ionis & AstraZeneca | ASO to reduce production of TTR Protein | Phase 3 | Monthly subcutaneous injection (SC) 
Acoramidis (AG10) | BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. | Small molecule drug to stabilize TTR protein | Phase 3 | Twice daily oral dose 
PRX004 | Novo Nordisk | mAb to clear amyloid deposits | Phase 2/3 | Intravenous (IV) infusion every four weeks
NI006 | Neurimmune AG & AstraZeneca | mAB to clear amyloid deposits | Phase 1 | Intravenous (IV) infusion 
NTLA-2001 | Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. & Regeneron | CRISPR/Cas9 gene therapy | Phase 1 | One-time intravenous (IV) infusion 

We are also aware of other companies that have pre-clinical development programs for the potential treatment of ATTR amyloidosis.
Acute Hepatic Porphyria. In addition to GIVLAARI, which is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with AHP, and in the EU for the treatment of AHP in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, there are also two approved hemin products, Panhematin (U.S.) and Normosang (EU), for the treatment of acute porphyria attacks. Panhematin and Normosang are both administered by intravenous infusion and are blood products currently manufactured by Recordati S.p.A. There are currently no competing products approved for prophylactic use; however, there is off-label prophylactic use of hemin by some physicians. We are aware of other companies that have pre-clinical development programs for the potential treatment of AHP.
Primary Hyperoxaluria. In addition to OXLUMO, which was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria, or PH, type 1, and in the EU for the treatment of PH type 1 in patients of all ages, currently used treatments for PH include hyper hydration, oral citrate or dual liver/kidney transplantation. Transplantation is costly and is an invasive procedure, which carries significant morbidity and mortality. This leaves a high unmet medical need for a severe and primarily pediatric disorder. Presently, there are several investigational drugs in varying stages of clinical development for the treatment of PH. We believe that the following drug candidates, if approved, could compete with OXLUMO:

Drug | Company | Drug Description | Phase | Administration/Dosing 
Nedosiran | Novo Nordisk | siRNA to reduce production of LDHA enzyme | Phase 2 (pivotal) | SC with monthly dosing 
BBP-711 | BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. | GO inhibitor | Phase 1 | Oral 
Oxabact OC5 | OxThera AB | Anaerobic bacteria that metabolize oxalate in the gut | Phase 3 (failed to meet statistical significance) | Twice daily oral dose 
Stiripentol | Biocodex SA | GABA reuptake inhibitor | Phase 2 | Oral 
Reloxaliase | Allena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | Oxalate-degrading enzyme for enteric hyperoxaluria | Phase 3 (for enteric hyperoxaluria) | Up to five daily oral doses

We are aware of other companies that have pre-clinical development programs for the potential treatment of PH.
Hypercholesterolemia. In addition to Leqvio, which was approved in the EU for the treatment of adults with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia and in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with HeFH or clinical ASCVD as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated dose of statin, the current standard of care for patients with hypercholesterolemia includes the use of dietary changes, lifestyle modification and the use of pharmacologic therapy. Front line therapy consists of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, which block production of cholesterol by the liver and increase clearance of LDL-C from the bloodstream. Several anti-PCSK9 antibodies have also been approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the U.S. and Europe. Other PCSK9-targeted approaches and other cholesterol lowering agents are in development at a number of companies.
We believe that the following approved drugs and, if approved, drug candidates, could compete with Leqvio:

Drug | Company | Drug Description | Phase | Administration/Dosing
Repatha | Amgen | Anti-PSCK9 mAb | Approved | SC 
Praluent | Sanofi | Anti-PSCK9 mAb | Approved | SC 
Vascepa | Amarin Corporation | Omega-3 lipid proven to reduce LDL-C and CV Risk | Approved | Oral 
NEXLETOL (Bempedoic Acid) | Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. | Oral fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis dual inhibitor | Approved | Oral 
Evkeeza (evinacumab) | Regeneron | Anti-ANGPTL3 mAb for hypercholesterolemia | Approved in HoFH | SC 
ARO-ANG3 | Arrowhead | siRNA targeting ANGPTL3 | Phase 2 | SC 
Vupanorsen | Ionis / Pfizer | ASO therapy to reduce levels of ANGPTL3 | Phase 2b | SC 
LIB-003 | LIB Therapeutics | Recombinant protein therapeutic | Phase 3 | SC 

Hemophilia. The global market for treatments of hemophilia and bleeding disorders is valued at more than $10.0 billion. Products on the market include: Factor VIII replacement products; Factor IX replacement products; factor replacement products with extended half-lives, and most recently a bispecific antibody mimicking Factor VIII. For the treatment of persons with inhibitors, there is an approved Factor VIIa replacement product and an activated prothrombin complex concentrate, as well as a bispecific antibody mimicking Factor VIII. In addition, new, innovative molecules are currently in development which may offer new treatments for people with hemophilia A and B, with and without inhibitors. A number of companies are also actively developing gene therapy products that use virus-like particles to deliver a functional section of a particular gene into the liver cells of a person with hemophilia.
We believe that the following approved drugs and, if approved, drug candidates, could compete with fitusiran, if fitusiran receives regulatory approval, along with additional approved drugs and drug candidates not listed below:

Drug (Company) | Drug Description | Phase | Administration 
Hemophilia A 
Advate (Takeda), Adynovate (Takeda), Kogenate (Bayer), Kovaltry (Bayer), Novoeight (Novo Nordisk), Xyntha (Pfizer), Nuwiq (Octapharma), Eloctate (Bioverativ) | Recombinant FVIII factor products | Approved | IV 
Valoctocogene roxaparvovec (BioMarin) | Gene therapy | Phase 3 | IV - Single Administration

Hemophilia A and B | | | 
Concizumab, anti-TFPI (Novo Nordisk) | Anti-TFPI antibody | Phase 2 | SC 
Marstacimab (Pfizer) | Anti-TFPI antibody | Phase 3 | SC - Weekly 

Other Competition
Finally, for many of the diseases that are the subject of our early-stage clinical, pre-clinical development and discovery RNAi therapeutic programs, there are already drugs on the market or in development. However, notwithstanding the availability of existing drugs or drug candidates, we believe there currently exists sufficient unmet medical need to warrant the advancement of our investigational RNAi therapeutic programs.
Regulatory Matters
U.S. Regulatory Considerations
The research, testing, manufacture and marketing of drug products and their delivery systems are extensively regulated in the U.S. and the rest of the world. In the U.S., drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacture, storage, record keeping, reporting, labeling, marketing and distribution of drug products. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicially-imposed sanctions and the inability to obtain or maintain required approvals to test or market drug products. These sanctions could include, among other things, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, clinical holds, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The steps ordinarily required before a new drug product may be marketed in the U.S. include nonclinical laboratory tests, animal tests and formulation studies, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective prior to commencement of clinical testing in the U.S., approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated, completion of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish that the drug product is safe and effective for the indication and other conditions of use for which FDA approval is sought, submission to the FDA of an NDA and FDA review and approval of the NDA. Satisfaction of the FDA's pre-market approval requirements typically takes several years, but may vary substantially depending upon the complexity of the product and the nature of the disease. Government regulation may delay, limit or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on a company’s activities. Success in early-stage clinical trials does not necessarily assure success in later-stage 
clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities, including but not limited to the data derived from our clinical trials for drug candidates, are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or even prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including new safety risks, may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
Nonclinical Tests and Clinical Trials
Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal testing to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests and formulation of compounds for testing must comply with applicable federal regulations and requirements, including in some cases the FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements and the Animal Welfare Act. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, together with chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, information, analytical and stability data, a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information. Clinical testing in humans may not commence until an IND is in effect.
An IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the sponsor that the proposed investigation(s) are subject to a clinical hold. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, the FDA’s concerns must be resolved prior to the commencement of clinical trials. The IND review process can result in substantial delay and expense. We, an IRB, or the FDA may, at any time, suspend, terminate, significantly modify, restrict or impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization, and then the clinical trials can commence or recommence only under the terms authorized by the FDA. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on human subjects in the U.S. must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations and requirements, commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, to assure data integrity and protect the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants. Among other things, GCP requires that all research subjects provide their informed consent prior to participating in any clinical study, and that an IRB for each institution participating in the clinical trial review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution and conduct continuing review throughout the trial. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects.
Clinical trials to support NDAs are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
•In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested primarily to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions and metabolism associated with increasing doses.
•Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to assess the optimum dosage and dose regimen, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and provide preliminary support for the efficacy of the drug in the indication being studied.
•Phase 3 clinical trials further evaluate the drug’s clinical efficacy, side effects and safety in an expanded patient population, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug.
Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing of any drug candidates may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the U.S. The FDA may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the subject participating in the study. An IRB or a clinical trial sponsor may also modify, suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA can also request or require that additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval. Finally, sponsors are required to publicly disseminate information about certain ongoing and completed clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov, a government website administered by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH.
New Drug Applications
We believe that any RNAi product candidate we develop, whether for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, AHP, PH1, hypercholesterolemia or the various indications targeted in our clinical development or nonclinical discovery programs, will be regulated by the FDA as a new drug that is not considered to be a biologic, and thus will require an NDA. FDA approval of an NDA is required before commercial distribution of a new drug may begin in the U.S. An NDA must include the results of extensive nonclinical, clinical and other testing, as described above, a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, CMC, proposed labeling and other information. In addition, an NDA for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration typically must contain data assessing the 
safety and effectiveness for the claimed indication in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, although deferrals or full or partial waivers may be available in some circumstances.
The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under the PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by an application fee. For fiscal year 2022, the application fee for each NDA requiring clinical data is approximately $3.1 million. The PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each approved prescription drug, which has been set at approximately $369,000 for fiscal year 2022. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the NDA also includes a non-orphan indication. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. During that time, the FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. If the FDA determines that an NDA is not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, it will issue a refuse to file determination and the NDA will not be reviewed by the FDA. If the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals regarding the timing of the completion of its review of NDAs, although the goals are not binding and the FDA does not always meet these goals. The review process is often significantly extended by the FDA's requests for additional information or clarification regarding information provided in the submission. For novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee, which is typically in the form of a panel that includes independent clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA may waive the review of an advisory committee and is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it often follows such recommendations. The FDA normally conducts a pre-approval inspection to gain assurance that the manufacturing facility or facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, purity and stability, and are in compliance with regulations governing current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. In addition, the FDA often will conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of select clinical trial sites involved in conducting pivotal studies to assure data integrity and compliance with applicable GCP requirements, and could also conduct GCP inspections of the sponsor.
If the FDA's evaluation of the NDA and the various inspections are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for a specific indication. The approved indication may be narrower than what was proposed by the applicant or for a narrower patient population than the population studied in clinical trials. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require post-approval evaluations, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 trials, or other surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or effectiveness and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, such as a Boxed Warning, and/or distribution and use restrictions through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, all of which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Once granted, product approvals may be further limited or withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or safety or other problems are identified following initial marketing.
Post-Approval Regulation
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements, including requirements for manufacturing establishment registration and product listing, AE reporting, submission of other periodic reports, field alerts, recordkeeping, product sampling and distribution. Additionally, the FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug products and biologics. In particular, the FDA generally prohibits pharmaceutical companies from promoting their drugs or biologics for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product’s approved labeling, and requires that important safety information be presented to balance information provided on a drug’s effectiveness. In addition, the FDA requires substantiation of any safety or effectiveness claims, including claims that one product is superior in terms of safety or effectiveness to another. Superiority claims generally must be supported by adequate and well-controlled head-to-head clinical trials. To the extent that market acceptance of our products depends on their superiority over existing therapies, any restriction on our ability to advertise or otherwise promote claims of superiority, or requirements to conduct additional expensive clinical trials to provide proof of such claims, could negatively affect the sales of our products or our costs. We must also notify the FDA of any change in an approved product beyond variations in the approved application. Certain changes to the product, its labeling or its manufacturing require prior FDA approval and may require the conduct of further clinical investigations to support the change. Such approvals may be expensive and time-consuming and, if not approved, the FDA will not allow the product to be commercially distributed as modified.
If the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA submission or GCP inspections or inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the product are not favorable or cannot be completed due to COVID-19 related restrictions, the FDA may defer action on an application or refuse to approve the NDA and issue a complete response letter. The complete response letter describes the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in an application and may recommend actions that the applicant can take to address the deficiencies. Such actions may include, among other things, conducting additional safety or efficacy studies. Even with the completion of this additional testing or the submission of additional requested information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA may withhold approval of an NDA regardless of prior advice it may have provided or commitments it may have made to the sponsor.
Some of our product candidates may need to be administered using specialized drug delivery systems that are considered to be medical devices. We may rely on drug delivery systems that are already approved or cleared to deliver drugs like ours to similar physiological sites or, in some instances, we may need to modify the design or labeling of the legally available device for delivery of our product candidate. The FDA may regulate our product candidate when used with a specialized drug delivery system as a combination product, which could permit the combination to be approved through a single application, such as an NDA. In some instances, the FDA could require separate, additional approvals or clearances for the modified device. If the FDA does require separate, additional approvals or clearances for the modified device, the FDA could require either a premarket approval application, or PMA, a 510(k) clearance, or a de novo classification, depending on the risk classification of the modified device and the availability of legally marketed predicate devices. Approval of PMAs are required for class III medical devices, which are devices for which insufficient information exists to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device through general controls and special controls. PMAs must contain sufficient valid scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. Clearance under section 510(k) of the FDCA is required for most class II medical devices, which are devices for which special controls are necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. A 510(k) submission demonstrates to the FDA that the device is substantially equivalent (i.e., at least as safe and effective based on the intended use and technological characteristics) as a legally marketed predicate device that is not subject to PMA requirements. If no such legally marketed predicate device exists, but the applicant believes the device should not be automatically classified into class III, the applicant can submit an application for de novo classification, which is a request to FDA to classify the device into class I or II based on certain general and, if applicable, special controls that are necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device. In addition, if the FDA requires a separate, additional approval or clearance for a delivery device to be used with our products, and the delivery device is owned by another company, we will need that company’s cooperation to implement the necessary changes to the device and to obtain any additional approvals or clearances, described above. Obtaining such additional approvals or clearances, and cooperation of other companies, when necessary, could significantly delay, and increase the cost of obtaining marketing approval, which could reduce the commercial viability of a product candidate. To the extent that we rely on previously unapproved drug delivery systems, we may be subject to additional testing and approval requirements from the FDA above and beyond those described above.
Abbreviated Applications and 505(b)(2) Applications
Once an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a listed drug that can, in turn, be relied upon by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA generally provides an abbreviated approval pathway for a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strength, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown through appropriate testing (unless waived) to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. A 505(b)(2) application is a type of NDA that relies, in part, upon data the applicant does not own and to which it does not have a right of reference. Such applications often are submitted for changes to previously approved drug products.
The approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications can be delayed by patents and non-patent exclusivity covering the listed drug. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains a previously approved active ingredient if the FDA determines that new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of approval for which the new clinical investigations were essential, such as a new dosage form or indication. Accordingly, three-year exclusivity generally protects changes to a previously approved drug product that require clinical testing for approval and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for generic versions of the drug product without such changes.
Federal law also provides a five-year period of NCE exclusivity following approval of a drug that contains an NCE. An NCE is a drug that contains an active moiety (the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance) that has never previously been approved by the FDA. If a listed drug has NCE exclusivity, ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications referencing the listed drug cannot be submitted to the FDA for five years following the approval of the listed drug unless the application contains a certification challenging a listed patent, i.e., a paragraph IV certification (discussed further below), in which case the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted four years following approval of the listed drug. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Additionally, applicants submitting an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application referencing a listed drug generally are required to make a certification with respect to each patent for the listed drug that is listed in the FDA’s publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. If the applicant is not seeking approval of a use claimed by a method-of-use patent, however, the applicant can submit a statement to that effect instead of making the certification. These certifications (and statements) affect when the FDA can approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant certifies that it does not intend to market its product before a listed patent expires (i.e., a paragraph III certification), then the FDA will not grant effective approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application 
until the relevant patent expires. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by its proposed product, and thus that it is seeking approval prior to patent expiration (i.e., a paragraph IV certification), and certain other steps are taken, then approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will be stayed (i.e., FDA will not approve the application) until 30 months have passed or patent disputes are resolved, as described below. Specifically, under the process set forth by the statute, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant must provide notice of its patent challenge to the NDA sponsor and the patent holder within certain time limits. If the patent holder then initiates a suit for patent infringement within 45 days of receipt of the notice, the FDA cannot grant effective approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until either 30 months have passed (which may be extended or shortened in certain cases) or there has been a court decision or settlement order holding or stating that the patents in question are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. If the court decision or settlement order holds or states that the patents in question are valid, enforceable, and would be infringed, however, then the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may not be approved until such patents expire. If the patent holder does not initiate a suit for patent infringement within the 45-day time limit described above, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be approved immediately upon successful completion of FDA review, unless blocked by another listed patent or regulatory exclusivity period.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, as amended, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or affects more than 200,000 individuals and for which there is no reasonable expectation of recovering drug development costs in the U.S. from sales in the U.S. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. We intend to request Orphan Drug Designation for our product candidates, if applicable. For example, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for patisiran and vutrisiran as therapeutic approaches for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, givosiran as a therapeutic approach for AHP, lumasiran as a therapeutic approach for PH1, fitusiran as a therapeutic approach for hemophilia A and B, and inclisiran as a therapeutic approach for HoFH.
If a product that has Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to Orphan Drug Exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve for seven years any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the “same drug” for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines “same drug” as a drug that contains the same active moiety and is intended for the same use as the previously approved orphan drug. For purposes of large molecule drugs, the FDA defines “same drug” as a drug that contains the same principal molecular structural features, but not necessarily all of the same structural features, and is intended for the same use as the previously approved drug. Notwithstanding the above definitions, a drug that is "clinically superior" to an orphan drug will not be considered the “same drug” and thus will not be blocked by Orphan Drug Exclusivity. To demonstrate a drug is “clinically superior” to the previously approved orphan drug, a sponsor must show that the drug provides a significant therapeutic advantage over and above the previously already approved drug in terms of greater efficacy, greater safety, or by providing a major contribution to patient care.
A designated orphan drug may not receive Orphan Drug Exclusivity for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received Orphan Drug Designation and regulatory approval. In addition, Orphan Drug Exclusivity may be lost if the FDA later determines that the Orphan Drug Designation request was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition, or if the manufacturer chooses to provide consent to approval of other applications.
Pediatric Study Plans
The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. Drugs with Orphan Drug Designation are exempt from these requirements to the extent that the indication being sought under the marketing application is within the scope of the designated orphan use. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the initial PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the PSP need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.
Fast Track Program
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to facilitate development and expedite the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the product and the specific indication for which it is 
being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biological product may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre–biologics license application meeting because many of the features of Fast Track designation will not apply after that time. Fast Track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA to expedite drug development and review as well as the opportunity for rolling review of the NDA. We intend to request Fast Track designation for our product candidates, if applicable. For example, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to patisiran for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis, which was approved in August 2018 for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults, and has also granted Fast Track designation to vutrisiran for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis.
Any drug or biological product that receives a Fast Track designation may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A drug or biological product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to available therapies. The FDA’s goal for taking action on an application with a priority review designation is six months from the date of receipt, instead of ten months from the date of receipt, except that two months are added to these time periods for drugs that contain a new molecular entity. Additionally, a drug or biological product may be eligible for accelerated approval if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and the product would provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. Under accelerated approval, a product may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefits. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA requires as a condition for accelerated approval advance submission of promotional materials prior to use, which could limit or delay the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
A drug or biological product can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a drug or biological product be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product and ideally before initiation of the pivotal clinical trial intended to serve as the primary basis for demonstration of efficacy to obtain the full benefits of the designation. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor, taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, and allowing a rolling review of the marketing application. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for patisiran, approved in August 2018, givosiran, approved in November 2019, as well as lumasiran, approved in November 2020. We intend to request breakthrough therapy designation for our other product candidates, if applicable.
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Voucher 
In addition, the FDCA provides a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, or PRV, program. The program is intended to incentivize the development of new drug and biological products for the prevention and treatment of “rare pediatric diseases,” that is, any disease that is a rare disease and is serious or life-threatening with the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affecting individuals from birth to 18. Under this program, the sponsor of an application for a rare pediatric disease drug may be eligible to obtain a voucher that can be used to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug application. The FDA recommends that a sponsor request rare pediatric disease designation before submission of the rare pediatric disease product application. The rare pediatric disease designation does not guarantee that the sponsor will receive a PRV. The FDA will award a PRV upon approval of the marketing application if the sponsor requests such a voucher in their marketing application and if the application meets the eligibility criteria. If awarded, the PRV may be transferred unlimited times. The rare pediatric disease PRV program was initially created in 2012, and Congress has extended the PRV program through September 30, 2024, with the potential for PRVs to be granted through September 30, 2026. The FDA awarded a rare pediatric disease PRV to us upon approval of the NDA for lumasiran in November 2020.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party 
payors include government healthcare programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors may provide coverage, but place stringent limitations on such coverage, such as requiring alternative treatments to be tried first. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive healthcare economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to incurring the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically reasonable or necessary or cost-effective. Even if a drug product is covered, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Lack of adequate third-party reimbursement may mean we are not able to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan;
•safe, effective and medically necessary;
•appropriate for the specific patient;
•cost-effective; and
•neither experimental nor investigational.
Federal, state and local governments in the U.S. and foreign governments continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing. Likewise, the Biden administration has indicated that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority, but we do not yet know what steps the administration will take or whether such steps will be successful.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to exert downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and pharmaceutical pricing regulations may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also referred to as the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, enacted in 2010, includes measures that have significantly changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:
•The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA increased pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic products to 23.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, and added a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, and modified the statutory definition of AMP. In addition, the ACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.
•In order for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must offer its innovator products on the Federal Supply Schedule for purchase at prices compliant with statutory and regulatory requirements and extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. The ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, because 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
•The ACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic products to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut 
hole”). Under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, effective in 2019, the mandated manufacturer coverage gap discount increased to 70%.
•The ACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic products; the fee is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs. The fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.
•The ACA created the Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and their immediate family members. Manufacturers annually report this information to CMS, which posts this information on its website. Legislation passed in 2018 expands the scope of covered recipients' non-physician providers such as to physician assistants and advanced practice nurses, effective in 2022.
•The ACA established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain drug products.
•The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
•The law expands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability.
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the Fifth Circuit Court and the United States Supreme Court; the Trump Administration has issued various Executive Orders which have eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various other provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices; and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended. We cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on our business.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse
Federal and state laws generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other healthcare-related business. For example, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any bribe, kickback or other remuneration intended to induce the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, healthcare products and services reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, including Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of this federal law can result in significant penalties, including imprisonment, monetary fines and assessments, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer would preclude any federal healthcare program from paying for its products. In addition to the federal anti-kickback law, many states have their own laws that are analogous to the federal anti-kickback law, but may apply regardless of whether any federal or state healthcare program business is involved.
In addition, federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly and willfully presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program, including Medicaid and Medicare. Some suits filed under the FCA, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by a “whistleblower” or “relator” on behalf of the government, and such individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Manufacturers can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, where they are found to have caused submission of false claims by, among other things, providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims, or by engaging in kickback arrangements or off-label promotion with customers that file claims. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. A number of states also have false claims laws, and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and/or commercial insurance. Sanctions under these federal and state fraud and abuse laws may include civil monetary penalties and criminal fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs and imprisonment.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for 
the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violation of the FCPA could result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and remedies, including fines, disgorgement, and imprisonment.
As described above, the federal Sunshine Act requires manufacturers to report certain payments to healthcare providers to CMS. Many state laws require drug manufacturers to report similar information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to other healthcare providers. Some states prohibit these expenditures altogether. Laws in a number of states also require companies to adopt marketing codes of conduct, companies to disclose pricing information about their products, or pharmaceutical sales representatives to be licensed.
As described above, we maintain a global compliance program designed to support the execution of our business strategy and operations in compliance with these laws.
Possible Change in Laws or Policies
From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of drug products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or reviewing courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and development of our product candidates and any products that we may commercialize. It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of any such changes may be. Federal budget uncertainties or spending reductions may reduce the capabilities of the FDA, extend the duration of required regulatory reviews, and reduce the availability of clinical research grants.
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances are or may be applicable to our activities. As noted above, the extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.
EU Regulatory Considerations
In the EU medicinal products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EU and national levels.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCP. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an entity within the EU to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain approval of the CTA from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The application for a CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the CTAs must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees.
Currently, CTAs must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU member state in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new EU Regulation on Clinical Trials, which became applicable on January 31, 2022, there is a centralized application procedure where one national authority leads the scientific review of the application leading to increased information-sharing and decision-making between member states. Each concerned member state will continue to complete an ethical review of any CTA.
Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public by the competent authority once the CTA is approved. The results of the clinical trial must be submitted by the sponsor to the competent authorities and, with the exception of non-pediatric Phase 1 trials, will be made public at the latest within six months of the end of a pediatric clinical trial, or otherwise within 12 months after the end of the trial.
During the development of a medicinal product, the EMA and national medicines regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the CHMP. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (CMC testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future MAA of the product concerned.
Marketing Authorisations
After completion of the required clinical testing, we must obtain a marketing authorisation before we may place a medicinal product on the market in the EU. There are various application procedures available, depending on the type of product involved. All application procedures require an application in the common technical document format, which includes the submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and nonclinical study and clinical trial information. There is an increasing trend in the EU towards greater transparency and, while the manufacturing or quality information is currently generally protected as confidential information, the EMA and national regulatory authorities are now liable to disclose much of the nonclinical and clinical information in marketing authorisation dossiers, including the full clinical study reports, in response to freedom of information requests after the marketing authorisation has been granted. In October 2014, the EMA adopted a policy under which clinical study reports would be posted on the agency’s website following the grant, denial or withdrawal of an MAA, subject to procedures for limited redactions and protection against unfair commercial use. A similar requirement is contained in the new Regulation on Clinical Trials.
The centralized procedure gives rise to marketing authorisations that are valid throughout the EU and, by extension (after national implementing decisions), in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which, together with the EU member states, comprise the European Economic Area, or EEA. Applicants file MAAs with the EMA, where they are reviewed by relevant scientific committees, including the CHMP. The EMA forwards CHMP opinions to the EC, which uses them as the basis for deciding whether to grant a marketing authorisation. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products that (1) are derived from biotechnology processes, (2) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, viral diseases or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, (3) are orphan medicinal products or (4) are advanced therapy medicinal products, such as gene or cell therapy medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant may voluntarily submit an application for a centralized marketing authorisation to the EMA, as long as the CHMP agrees that (i) the medicine concerned contains a new active substance, (ii) the medicine is a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation, or (iii) if its authorisation under the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health.
For those medicinal products for which the centralized procedure is not available, the applicant must submit MAAs to the national medicines regulators through one of three procedures: (1) a national procedure, which results in a marketing authorisation in a single EU member state; (2) the decentralized procedure, in which applications are submitted simultaneously in two or more EU member states; and (3) the mutual recognition procedure, which must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other EU member state, and in which the EU member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the other EU member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health. A national procedure is only possible for one member state; as soon as an application is submitted in a second member state the mutual recognition or decentralized procedure will be triggered.
Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days. However, this timeline excludes clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP, so the overall process typically takes a year or more. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major interest for public health and therapeutic intervention, defined by the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach for the disease to be treated; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit of the new product. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. The EMA granted an accelerated assessment for patisiran, which was approved in the EU in August 2018 under the centralized procedure.
Data Exclusivity
MAAs for generic medicinal products do not need to include the results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, but instead can refer to the data included in the marketing authorisation of a reference product for which regulatory data exclusivity has expired. If a marketing authorisation is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic MAAs referring to the data of that product will not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The two-year market exclusivity period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years of the product's authorisation, a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved.
There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate pre-clinical studies or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the EU. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.
Orphan Medicinal Products
The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, may recommend orphan medicinal product designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the product in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. The COMP may only recommend orphan medicinal product designation when the product in question offers a significant clinical benefit over existing approved products for the relevant indication or where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition exists. Following a positive opinion by the COMP, the EC adopts a decision granting orphan status. The COMP will reassess orphan status in parallel with EMA review of an MAA and orphan status may be withdrawn at that stage if it no longer fulfills the orphan criteria (for instance because in the meantime a new product was approved for the indication and no convincing data are available to demonstrate a significant benefit over that product). Orphan medicinal product designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing authorisation. During this period, the competent authorities may not accept or approve any similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication, unless the second medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan medicinal product designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of orphan designation. Patisiran, approved in the EU in August 2018, givosiran, approved in the EU in March 2020, lumasiran, approved in the EU in November 2020, as well as vutrisiran and fitusiran have been granted orphan medicinal product designation.
Post-Approval Controls
The holder of a marketing authorisation must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorisation. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorisation obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorisation safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.
All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.
Manufacturing
Medicinal products may only be manufactured in the EU, or imported into the EU from another country, by the holder of a manufacturing authorisation from the competent national authority. The manufacturer or importer must have a qualified person who is responsible for certifying that each batch of product has been manufactured in accordance with EU standards of cGMP before releasing the product for commercial distribution in the EU or for use in a clinical trial. Manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the competent authorities for compliance with cGMP.
Pricing and Reimbursement
Governments influence the price of medicinal products in the EU through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.
Regulation of New Drug Compounds in Other Jurisdictions
In addition to regulations in the U.S. and the EU, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. In particular, during 2021, we filed for regulatory approval for our commercial products in a number of jurisdictions worldwide, and regulatory filings in additional countries are planned for ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO in 2022, and we will have to follow the specific regulations in such jurisdictions and such other countries in which we file, which are complex.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in all or most foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Similarly, all clinical trials in Australia require, among other things, review and approval of clinical trial proposals by an ethics committee, which provides a combined ethical and scientific review process.
In Canada, for example, authorization for clinical trials of pharmaceuticals is obtained by way of CTAs. Health Canada (the regulator in Canada that regulates, among other things, research, testing, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals) approval is required for clinical trials using pharmaceuticals not authorized for sale in Canada (e.g., Phases I to III clinical trials and comparative bioavailability studies), and for trials of marketed pharmaceuticals where the proposed use is outside the marketing authorization. In addition, Research Ethics Boards, or REBs, oversee the conduct of clinical trials in Canada, and REB approval is required for each clinical trial site prior to commencing the trial at that site. Post-approval, both Health Canada and the REBs monitor the safety data of the clinical trials and assess serious adverse reactions filed throughout the trial. Health Canada may conduct site inspections to verify whether the conduct of a trial meets the requirements of GCP. An REB may impose conditions in relation to the conduct of clinical trials, and may require the informed consent used in the trial to be amended to address ethical concerns and privacy considerations.
Likewise, in Brazil, if a human clinical trial is to be carried out within the country’s territory, in addition to the CTA-like authorization and the approval by an ethics committee, the commencement of the trials may also depend on the approval by a biosecurity commission.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials varies from country to country. In all cases, however, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP, which have their origin in the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki, the applicable regulatory requirements, and guidelines developed by the ICH for GCP in clinical trials.
The approval procedure also varies among countries and can involve requirements for additional testing. The time required may differ from that required for FDA approval and may be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Thus, there can be substantial delays in obtaining required approvals from foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed. Additionally, foreign governments lately are encouraging manufacturers to submit marketing applications in their jurisdictions with a variety of incentives including favorable reimbursement ratemaking. In Canada, while Health Canada has developed service standards for regulatory review time, those are target or estimated timelines that we can reasonably expect to receive from the regulator under normal circumstances, and as such, there may be delays in certain situations. In Brazil, obtaining the approval to begin human clinical trials can take from 180 to 360 days, and the marketing approval process itself usually takes between nine to 12 months. On the other hand, many countries have developed programs to expedite the approval of drugs pertaining to certain categories. In Brazil, for example, drugs designed to treat rare diseases can benefit from priority review and obtain marketing approval in less than six months.
With respect to marketing authorization, Canada typically approves pharmaceuticals by way of a Notice of Compliance, or NOC, together with a drug identification number, or DIN. NOCs are issued to pharmaceutical manufacturers following the satisfactory review of a new drug submission. Along with the NOC, a DIN is also issued to indicate the official approval and allow the sponsor to market the pharmaceutical in Canada. A DIN is an eight-digit number and uniquely identifies all pharmaceutical products sold in a dosage form in Canada. Additional obligations must be fulfilled when seeking marketing authorization for biologic medicinal products (whether innovative biologics or biosimilars) in Canada. In addition to the information required for other pharmaceuticals, biologics must include more detailed chemistry and manufacturing information, which ensures the purity and quality of the product. Because slight variations in the manufacturing process can lead to a different product, sponsors must include details of the method of manufacturing in its submission.
Product pricing and reimbursement vary as well. Canada’s pricing of patented pharmaceuticals is controlled by the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, or PMPRB, whose regulatory authority is established by the Patented Medicines Regulations under Canada’s Patent Act. The PMPRB is a regulatory board unique to Canada. Various other regulatory bodies are involved in the pricing of pharmaceuticals that are publicly funded, including the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, the Institut national d’excellence en santé et en services sociaux, the pan Canadian Pharmaceutical Pricing Alliance, and public payors (e.g., provincial governments and territories). Each province of Canada has its own legislation relating to the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals, the permitted upcharges for wholesalers and pharmacies, the applicable dispensing fees, and whether rebates and professional allowances to pharmacies are prohibited or permitted. Approximately 40% of pharmaceuticals sold in Canada are paid for by the provincial (public) drug plans; the remainder are sold in the private market (e.g., covered by private insurance or paid for by individuals). The pricing of pharmaceuticals in the private market is less regulated than the pricing of pharmaceuticals in the public market. 
In Brazil, price ceiling is government-regulated and must be approved by a specific commission prior to marketing. Since Brazil has a public health system that aims to provide free treatment and care to its whole population, public procurement follows a specific process that requires drugs to be included in the system’s formularies prior to being distributed to patients cost-free.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. In Canada, contravention of the federal Food and Drugs Act, or F&DA, (governs all aspects of the manufacturing, importing, labelling, distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals) and its regulations may result in various enforcement actions from Health Canada, including notice letters, request for plan for corrective measures, public advisories, additional restrictions to our licenses or product authorization, recall, seizure, forfeiture and destruction of our products, refusal, suspension, cancellation or revocation of our authorization, license or registration. In the event of a contravention of the F&DA, Health Canada determines the most appropriate level of intervention depending on the severity of the risk posed by regulatory non-compliance. In certain circumstances, the regulatory enforcement responses are not appropriate to achieve compliance, and Health Canada may investigate potential criminal offences under the F&DA and/or refer to law enforcement for prosecution in relation to offences under the F&DA and the Criminal Code of Canada. The F&DA contains criminal provisions which allow for the issuance of fines, a term of imprisonment, or both.
Hazardous Materials
Our research, development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive materials and produce waste products. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. We do not expect the cost of complying with these laws and regulations to be material.
Manufacturing
To date, we have manufactured only limited supplies of drug substance for use in IND-enabling toxicology studies in animals at our own facilities, as well as patisiran formulated bulk drug product for late-stage clinical trial use and commercial supply. We have contracted with several third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the supply of drug substance, drug product and finished product to meet our needs for pre-clinical toxicology studies, clinical and commercial supply. We expect to continue to rely on third-party CMOs for the supply of drug substance and drug product, including ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, as well as other product candidates, for at least the next several years, including to support the potential launch of our additional product candidates and to supply the needs of our alliance partners. In 2015, we amended our manufacturing services agreement with Agilent Technologies, Inc., or Agilent, to provide for Agilent to supply, subject to any conflicting obligations under our third-party agreements, a specified percentage of the active pharmaceutical ingredients required for certain of our products in clinical development, as well as other products the parties may agree upon in the future. Under this agreement, we are required to provide rolling forecasts for products on a quarterly basis, a portion of which will be considered a binding, firm order. Agilent is required to reserve sufficient capacity to ensure that it can supply products in the amounts specified under such firm orders, as well as up to a certain percentage of the remaining, non-binding portions of each forecast. Subject to any conflicting obligations under our third-party agreements, we have also agreed to negotiate in good faith to enter into separate commercial manufacturing supply agreements with Agilent for certain products, consistent with certain specified terms, including a specified minimum purchase commitment. Currently, Agilent is the sole manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI for both clinical and commercial use, and we have entered into manufacturing services agreements with Agilent for such supply of ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. Pursuant to the Agilent supply agreement for ONPATTRO, we are required to provide rolling forecasts on a quarterly basis, a portion of which will be considered a binding, firm order. Agilent is required to reserve sufficient capacity to ensure that it can supply ONPATTRO in the amounts specified under such firm orders, including a certain percentage of the remaining, non-binding portions of each forecast, as well as a specified number of batches each year. 
In 2012, we established a manufacturing facility and have developed cGMP capabilities and processes for the manufacture of patisiran formulated bulk drug product for late-stage clinical trial use and commercial supply. During 2013, we manufactured our first cGMP batch of patisiran for use in our Phase 2 OLE and Phase 3 clinical trials. We will continue to manufacture commercial supply for formulated bulk drug product for ONPATTRO in our facility for the foreseeable future. Commercial quantities of ONPATTRO and any other drugs that we may seek to develop will have to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with FDA regulations and other federal, state and local regulations, as well as comparable foreign regulations. 
During 2020, we completed construction and qualification of our cGMP manufacturing facility in Norton, Massachusetts where we currently manufacture drug substance for clinical programs and, eventually, intend to manufacture drug substance for commercial use. In December 2020, we began cGMP operations, and we believe this facility will enable us to initiate manufacturing for 10-15 new early-stage programs over the next few years, as well as provide us the manufacturing capabilities to support our late-stage and commercial programs in the future.
We believe we have sufficient manufacturing capacity through our third-party CMOs and our current internal manufacturing facilities to meet our current research, clinical and commercial needs and the needs of our alliance partners. We believe that the current supply capacity we have established externally, together with the internal capacity we developed to support pre-clinical trials, our existing facility for patisiran formulated bulk drug product and our Norton manufacturing facility, will be sufficient to meet our and our alliance partners’ anticipated needs for the next several years. We monitor the capacity 
availability for the manufacture of drug substance and drug product and believe that our supply agreements with our CMOs and the lead times for new supply agreements would allow us to access additional capacity to meet our and our alliance partners’ currently anticipated needs. We also believe that our products can be manufactured at a scale and with production and procurement efficiencies that will result in commercially competitive costs.
Commercial Operations
After successfully overcoming various challenges associated with developing a new class of innovative medicines - such as solving the issue of drug delivery, optimizing our RNAi therapeutics to exhibit potency and durability of effect, and designing and carrying out comprehensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and clinical efficacy of our investigational products - starting in 2018, we embarked on the next part of the company’s journey: launching our RNAi therapeutics, based on regulatory approvals, to reach eligible patients in need. To that end, we have continued to build a global commercial operation which has been designed to be fully integrated and to sequentially manage multiple product launches across multiple geographies. Over the last several years, we have been building commercial capability and leveraging the internal knowledge we have accumulated as well as hiring talented people with broad industry experience to enable us to commercialize our products ourselves and with collaborators in key countries globally. The conduct of these commercial activities will continue to be dependent upon regulatory approvals and on agreements that we have made or may make in the future with strategic collaborators, currently as follows with respect to our first four approved products and our late-stage clinical programs:
•With respect to our ATTR amyloidosis franchise, we have global rights to develop and commercialize both the approved product, ONPATTRO, and the investigational RNAi therapeutic, vutrisiran, the next potential product in late-stage development in this franchise;
•For GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, we have global rights to develop and commercialize;
•For Leqvio, we granted MDCO, which was acquired by Novartis in January 2020, global rights to develop and commercialize; and
•For fitusiran, Sanofi has global rights to develop and commercialize fitusiran and any back-ups as a result of the 2018 amendment to the Sanofi collaboration and the related product-specific license terms.
Throughout the development of our product candidates, we have remained focused on keeping patients at the center of everything we do. This patient focus has continued as we have transitioned into commercialization. ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, as well as the late-stage programs we are advancing internally to commercialization are focused on orphan diseases, and we have been executing on what we believe to be a proven strategy to make ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI, OXLUMO and future orphan products successful, including through efforts to increase awareness and diagnosis. In addition, as part of our planned transition to a top five biotech by the end of 2025 and consistent with our Alnylam P5x25 strategy, we are now advancing RNAi therapeutics beyond rare diseases into prevalent disease opportunities. With the approval of Leqvio, the first RNAi therapeutic approved for a common disease, we believe the RNAi therapeutic profile supports the potential for expansion to prevalent diseases, including addressing many unmet needs in common disease settings such as hypertension, NASH, gout and diabetes. We believe we are establishing a global commercial organization and infrastructure to successfully support an expansion to prevalent diseases.
We have a proactive market access strategy that includes entering into value-based agreements, or VBAs, with commercial payers in the U.S. and certain state Medicaid programs. As of the beginning of 2022, we have completed at least 43 VBAs with multiple commercial payers, including 19 for ONPATTRO, 13 for GIVLAARI, and 11 for OXLUMO. In our VBAs for GIVLAARI we introduced a Prevalence Based Adjustment that provides for a rebate to be paid if the number of patients identified within a plan population exceeds the expected disease prevalence, to address an unknown that exists in the context of an ultra-rare disease. For OXLUMO, we established a new VBA component called a Patient Need Adjustment with the effect of providing payers with greater budget certainty for medicines administered across a broad range of patient age groups by paying a rebate if the average number of vials utilized by a plan member exceeds an established threshold. Discussions with additional payers continue for our marketed products. Outside of the U.S. we believe we have made strong progress in terms of patient access and have established availability of ONPATTRO in more than 20 countries through direct reimbursement or expanded access.
We are continuing to augment the key components of a global commercial organization with a focus on successfully launching our commercially approved products around the world and preparing for the anticipated commercial launches of additional RNAi therapeutics, assuming successful development and regulatory approval. With respect to commercially approved products, throughout 2021, we continued to build our commercial capabilities, including establishing field teams in the U.S. and other global markets, and are continuing to expand these capabilities to additional countries globally. We are continuing to build a focused commercial team with broad experience in marketing, sales, patient access, patient services, distribution and product reimbursement, in particular for orphan diseases. We are also continuing to incorporate and enhance the appropriate quality systems, compliance policies, systems and procedures, as well as implementing internal systems and infrastructure in order to support global commercial sales, and the establishment of patient-focused programs.
Ultimately, we intend to leverage the commercial infrastructure that we have built for ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO to also support the potential launch of vutrisiran, assuming regulatory approval. For many territories/countries, we may also elect to utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products. Our objective is to continue to execute successful product launches leveraging our positive experience with the launches of ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO.
Medical Affairs
Our Global Medical Affairs organization advances our efforts through stakeholder engagement, data dissemination, and healthcare professional education, ultimately enabling diagnosis and improving patient care. This begins with our efforts to engage patient groups and communities, improve disease awareness and increase patient diagnosis, including through support for independent third party genetic testing programs like Alnylam Act. With a scalable framework in these capabilities, we believe our Global Medical Affairs organization is well positioned to expand to prevalent diseases.
Human Capital Management 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 1,665 full-time employees, of whom approximately 1,290 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 375 were employed outside of the U.S. None of our employees in the U.S. are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. During 2021, we enhanced our capabilities by adding 212 new full-time employees. The new employees were hired to support a variety of functions and key initiatives, including extending our research, clinical and pre-clinical pipeline development, as well as our medical affairs, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities, with hires in commercial, compliance, legal, clinical development and operations, research, medical affairs, manufacturing, and general and administrative functions. We expect to continue to add additional employees in 2022, with a focus on further enhancing our capabilities and increasing our capacities in these areas, in particular our manufacturing, commercial and compliance teams, as well as expanding our geographic reach as we continue the global launches of our approved medicines and prepare for the planned launch of vutrisiran, assuming regulatory approval. 
We consider the intellectual capital, skills and experience of our employees to be an essential driver of our business and key to our future prospects. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and other research institutions, and we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. To attract qualified applicants to our company and retain our employees, we offer a total rewards package consisting of base salary and cash target bonus targeting the 50th to 65th percentile of market based on geography, a comprehensive benefit package and equity compensation for every employee. Annual cash bonus opportunity and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility. Any actual bonus payout is based solely on our performance against our corporate goals in the case of executive officers and is based on a combination of individual performance and corporate performance (or regional or national commercial performance metrics, as applicable) in the case of all other employees.
As a global commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, we believe that our long-term success and ability to deliver innovative, safe and effective medicines to patients requires a diverse and inclusive workforce. We value diversity at all levels of the organization and continue to focus on extending our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from: working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse, high performing teams; to ensuring that we attract, develop and retain diverse talent from all backgrounds; to increasing awareness within our company of unconscious biases, and supporting affinity groups comprised of individuals who are underrepresented in our company, industry or society, such as women, members of the LGBTQ community and people of color. In addition, we pride ourselves on an open culture that respects co-workers, values employees’ health and well-being and fosters professional development. We support employee growth and development in a variety of ways including with group training, individual mentoring and coaching, conference attendance and tuition reimbursement. Our management conducts annual employee engagement surveys and reports to our board of directors on human capital management topics, including corporate culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, employee development and retention, and compensation and benefits. Similarly, our board of directors regularly provides input on important decisions relating to these matters, including with respect to employee compensation and benefits, talent retention and development.
