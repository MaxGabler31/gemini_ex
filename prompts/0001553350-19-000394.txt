Item 1. 
Business

General

EPHS Holdings, Inc. (EPHS or the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 28, 1999 under the name Quantum Bit Induction Technology, Inc. On November 14, 2011, the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation changing its name to Quantumbit, Inc. On September 26, 2013, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment changing its name to Sertant, Inc. On January 11, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State changing its name to EPHS Holdings, Inc.

The Companys original plan was to build and use technology to mine gold, platinum, precious metals and rare earth metals in situ from seawater and from slurries created from land-based ores. The Companys property was located in Nevada. The Company also explored developing technology to selectively electroplate precious and rare earth metals from solution or seawater onto collector electrodes. These endeavors were not successful, and the Company has since elected to cease operations with respect to these endeavors. 

With no operations, the Company was placed into receivership on February 15, 2017 (Case No. 2017-10544, as filed in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, 151st Judicial District) and remained in receivership until December 2017. In July 2017, the court appointed Angela Collette as exclusive receiver over the Company. Angela Collette was also appointed as the Companys president. In February 2017, one of the Companys shareholders sued the Company for breach of fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and good faith to the Companys shareholders. In September 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with the shareholder and the receiver to resolve the legal claim by issuing 4,750,000 shares of common stock to the shareholder. 

On December 28, 2017, the Company issued to EPHS, Inc., a Florida corporation, 75,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock for $110,000 which represented approximately 62% of the Companys issued and outstanding shares of common stock.

The Company sought to effect a merger, exchange of capital stock, asset acquisition or other similar business combination (a Business Combination) with an operating or development stage business (the Target Business) which desired to utilize the Companys status as a reporting corporation under the Exchange Act. In furtherance thereof, the Company signed a Letter of Intent to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Emerald Plants Health Source, Inc., a Quebec corporation (Emerald). Emerald was a Canada based company engaged in the cultivation of cannabis. On February 27, 2018, pursuant to the terms of a Share Exchange Agreement (the Emerald Agreement), we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Emerald and Emerald became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Emerald Agreement, executed between the Company and the shareholders of Emerald, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Emerald in exchange for the issuance of 20,000,000 restricted shares of the Companys common stock, which at the time, represented approximately 14% of the then issued and outstanding common stock of EPHS Holdings. Paolo Gervasi and Calogero Caruso were the sole shareholders of Emerald and received a total of 14,000,000 shares of our common stock. The remaining 6,000,000 shares were issued to consultants, including 1,250,000 shares to our president, Gianfranco John Bentivoglio for services rendered as part of the negotiations of the Emerald Agreement. The transaction closed on February 27, 2018. 

As a result of the transactions affected by the Emerald Agreement, Emerald became a wholly owned subsidiary of EPHS Holdings. Emerald is a development stage company with limited operations. Emeralds business plan is to cultivate and distribute cannabis entirely within Canada. With the acquisition of Emerald, the Company will be dependent on Mr. Gervasi and Mr. Caruso to continue managing the operations of Emerald. At this time, we have no employment agreements with either, and there can be no assurance that they will remain with the Company.

2018 Developments

On September 27, 2018, we entered into a binding Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) with Merritt Valley ‎Cannabis Corp. (“MVC”), a Canadian corporation engaged in providing low cost energy, project plans, intellectual ‎property and proprietary business plans for the cannabis industry. The LOI contemplated that the Company would ‎purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of MVC in consideration for new issuance of 8,100,000 shares of ‎the Company’s common stock.‎

On November 6, 2018, the Company executed a Share Exchange Agreement (the “MVC Agreement”) with MVC and its shareholders (the ‎‎“MVC Shareholders”) whereby MVC Shareholders agreed to exchange all of their respective shares in MVC in ‎consideration for 8,100,000 shares of EPHS common stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share (the “MVC ‎Transaction”).‎ On January 11, 2019, the Company and MVC completed the MVC Agreement.‎

On February 7, 2019, in connection with the MVC Transaction, the Company completed the purchase of lands located in Merritt, British Columbia, Canada, with the purpose of cultivating cannabis. 

Business Operations and Segments

We currently have no operations and only nominal cash for ongoing business operations. We may experience illiquidity and may be dependent on our management and shareholders to provide funds to maintain our activities. However, there is no assurance that our management and shareholders will be continued to fund our operations. We have no commitment for either additional debt or equity funding from any source.

On October 12, 2018 the Company received approval for its commercial cultivation license, identified as a license ‎for Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulation (“ACMPR”), from Health Canada. Now, the Company ‎can produce products for medicinal use, such as, licensed products, dried or fresh cannabis, cannabis oil, starting ‎materials and plants. 

Until the time that the Company can begin commercial operations, the Company will continue to rely on its existing cash reserves and additional funding from management and shareholders. The Company plans to seek additional debt and equity financing to fund its operations. 

Presently, the Company has five full-time employees. Paolo Gervasi and Calogero Caruso became employees of the Company after the Companys acquisition of Emerald. On November 6, 2018, Stevan Perry became the President of the Company. On November 20, 2018, Stuart R. Ross became the Companys Chief Financial Officer. Gianfranco John Bentivoglio is the Companys Chief Executive. None of the Companys five employees collects a salary at this time. In the next twelve months, assuming the commencement of commercial operations, we expect to engage approximately 15 full-time employees and 10 temporary or part-time employees. The Company also anticipates entering into employment agreements with Messrs. Bentivoglio, Gervasi and Caruso in the near future. 

Emerald

Emerald is the Companys sole operating subsidiary. Emerald is based in Quebec, Canada and conducts its operations entirely within Canada. On October 12, 2018, the Company received approval for its commercial cultivation licenses, identified as a license for ACMPR from Health Canada. 

Having obtained its ACMPR, Emerald is now required to apply for an additional sales license. In applying for a sales license for cannabis, Emerald has submitted its first two cannabis crops to Health Canada for inspection. The inspection will examine the cannabis for contaminants and environmental control. Once the license is granted, Emerald be able to sell cannabis to licensed distributors throughout Canada. While Emerald has not yet entered into any definitive agreements or other arrangements with licensed distributors, Emerald plans to only sell to distributors who will distribute its cannabis solely within Canada.

On February 5, 2019 the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Pure Global Cannabis Inc. (Pure) which will be followed by a Wholesale Supply Agreement (Wholesale Agreement) to provide 1,000 kilograms of Cannabis Flower over a 14 month period, beginning July 2019.

Regulatory Matters

Commercial Cultivation of Cannabis:

In order to become licensed in Canada and the province of Quebec to grow and sell cannabis, licensed commercial cannabis companies must:

·
 Maintain their license in good standing; 
 ·
 Establish personnel security measures;
 ·
 Comply with and implement good production practices;
 ·
 Comply with packaging, shipping, labeling, import and export requirements, and record-keeping requirements; and
 ·
 Comply with client registration and ordering requirements. 

Labeling, testing and notice requirements for cannabis products include the following:

·
 Cannabis oil must include the carrier oil used for cannabis oil in dosage form, it must include the number of capsules or units in the container, the net weight, and the volume of each capsule or unit;
 ·
 Fresh and dried marijuana must include the percentage of THC and CBD that could be yielded, taking into account the potential to convert THC-Acid and CBD-Acid into THC and CBD;
 ·
 The accuracy of weight and volume of products in packages must be between 95% and 105%; 
 ·
 All analytical testing required to be done using validated methods (e.g., contaminants, disintegration, and solvent residue testing) and requiring disintegration testing for cannabis oil in capsules or similar dosage forms; and
 ·
 Notification to the Minister of Health required prior to commencing a recall.

Government Regulation of Cannabis

The use of marijuana for medical purposes in Canada is governed by the Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (the MMPR). The MMPR deals exclusively with the medical use of marijuana and does not address the issue of legalizing marijuana for general use.

The Canadian government does not endorse the use of marijuana, but the courts have required reasonable access to a legal source of marijuana when authorized by a physician. In July 2018 the Canadian Government passed a bill in Parliament that legalized marijuana for personal use and revised the licensing requirements for producers that required them to obtain an ACMPR, the Company was granted that license on October 12, 2018. This allows the production of marijuana for medical and personal use.

MMPR also sets forth the requirements for licensed producers of medical marijuana. These regulations include:

·
 Physical security measures;
 ·
 Good production practices;
 ·
 Packaging, labeling and shipping requirements;
 ·
 Import and export permit, if applicable; and
 ·
 Security clearance.

Physical Security Measures

Production sites need to be located indoors, and not in a private dwelling. The MMPR sets out physical security requirements that are necessary to secure sites where licensed producers may conduct activities with marijuana other than storage. Health Canada has established security requirements for the storage of all controlled substances including dried marijuana by licensed producers. All ACMPR license holders must demonstrate to Health Canada that they meet these security requirements. Licensed producer sites are subject to compliance and enforcement measures, including regular audits and inspections by Health Canada.
Good Production Practices

Licensed producers are subject to Good Production Practices that are meant, among other things, to ensure the cleanliness of the premises and equipment. The licensed producer is required to employ a quality assurance person with appropriate training, experience, and technical knowledge to approve the quality of dried marijuana prior to making it available for sale. The purpose of such tests, is to ensure that dried marijuana is of proper quality and free of any microbial and/or chemical contaminants.

Furthermore, licensed producers must meet, but are not limited to, the following MMPR requirements associated with Good Production Practices:

·
 Sanitation program;
 ·
 Standard operating procedures; and
 ·
 Establishment of a recall system.

Packaging, Labeling and Shipping – Consumer Information

Dried marijuana must be packaged in a tamper-evident and child-resistant container and contain standard information about the product (including but not limited to, the weight in grams and the packaging date). In addition, all licensed producers are required to attach a client-specific label, similar to a patient-specific prescription drug label, to the package of dried marijuana.

As described above, labeling, testing and notice requirements for cannabis products will include the following: 

·
 Cannabis oil must include the carrier oil used for cannabis oil in dosage form, it must include the number of capsules or units in the container, the net weight, and the volume of each capsule or unit;
 ·
 Fresh and dried marijuana must include the percentage of THC and CBD that could be yielded, taking into the account the potential to convert THC-Acid and CBD-Acid into THC and CBD;
 ·
 The accuracy of weight and volume of products in packages must be between 95% and 105%; 
 ·
 All analytical testing required to be done using validated methods (e.g., contaminants, disintegration, and solvent residue testing) and requiring disintegration testing for cannabis oil in capsules or similar dosage forms; and
 ·
 Notification to the Minister of Health required prior to commencing a recall.

Import and Export Permit

A licensed producer must obtain a permit from the Minister of Health prior to importing or exporting marijuana. At this time, the Company has no plans to export marijuana.
Security Clearance

The following individuals are required to have a valid security clearance under the MMPR:

·
 The applicant (if an individual);
 ·
 All officers and directors of a corporate applicant;
 ·
 The proposed Senior Person in Charge (as defined in the MMPR);
 ·
 The proposed Responsible Person in Charge (as defined in the MMPR); and
 ·
 The proposed Alternate Person(s) in Charge (as defined in the MMPR).

In addition to compliance with statutory guidelines prescribed at the federal level, controlled substances are also subject to regulation at the provincial level. Though provincial-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the provinces are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule any product candidates as well. While some Canadian provinces automatically schedule a drug based on federal action, other provinces schedule drugs through rulemaking or a legislative action. Provincial scheduling may delay commercial sale of any product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could have a material adverse effect on the commercial attractiveness of such product. 
Competition

The Company competes for market share with other companies, including other producers licensed by Health Canada, which have longer operating histories and more financial resources, manufacturing and marketing experience than us. There are currently hundreds of applications for licensed producer status (Licensed Producer) being processed by Health Canada. The number of licenses granted and the number of Licensed Producers ultimately authorized by Health Canada could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete for market share in Canadas medical cannabis industry. The Company expects to face additional competition from new market entrants that are granted licenses under the ACMPR, New Cannabis Act, or existing license holders that are not yet active in the industry.
