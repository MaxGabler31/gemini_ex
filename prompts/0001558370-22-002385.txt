Overview 
We are a biopharmaceutical company with multiple peptide-based new chemical entities in different stages of development, all derived from the Company's proprietary technology platform. Our clinical programs address two broad categories of diseases; (i) hematology and blood disorders, and (ii) inflammatory and immunomodulatory diseases. 
Figure 1: Our Product Pipeline 
​
Our most advanced clinical asset, rusfertide (generic name for PTG-300), is an injectable hepcidin mimetic in development for the potential treatment of erythrocytosis, iron overload and other blood disorders. Hepcidin is a key hormone in regulating iron equilibrium and is critical to the proper development of red blood cells. Rusfertide mimics the effect of the natural hormone hepcidin, but with greater potency, solubility and stability. We initiated REVIVE, a Phase 2 proof of concept (“POC”) study in the blood disorder polycythemia vera (“PV”), in the third quarter of 2019. We initiated a Phase 2 POC study in hereditary hemochromatosis (“HH”) in January 2020, which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2021. During the first quarter of 2021, we initiated PACIFIC, another Phase 2 study for rusfertide in up to 20 patients diagnosed with PV and with routinely elevated hematocrit levels (>48%). 
​
In June 2021, we presented updated Phase 2 data supporting the long-term efficacy of rusfertide in PV during an oral presentation at the European Hematology Association (“EHA”) 2021 Virtual Congress. An abstract highlighting positive preliminary data from our Phase 2 study of rusfertide in HH was orally presented at The Liver Meeting® 2021, hosted by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (“AASLD”), which took place virtually in November 2021. In December 2021, two abstracts highlighting positive updated data from our REVIVE and PACIFIC Phase 2 studies of rusfertide in PV were orally presented at the American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) 2021 Annual Meeting, in addition to three poster presentations on rusfertide in PV and HH. These results provided evidence regarding the potential of rusfertide for managing hematocrit, reducing thrombotic risk and improving iron deficiency symptoms. Rusfertide has a unique mechanism of action in the potential treatment of PV, which may enable it to specifically decrease and maintain hematocrit levels within the range of recommended clinical guidelines without causing the iron deficiency that can occur with frequent phlebotomy. 
​
On September 16, 2021, the FDA placed a clinical hold on our rusfertide clinical studies following our submission to the FDA of findings in a 26-week rasH2 transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study. In October 2021, we submitted a Complete Response to the FDA related to the clinical hold, and the FDA removed the clinical hold on October 8, 2021. In our Complete Response, we provided the individual patient clinical safety reports the FDA requested for human 

4



cancers observed in rusfertide clinical trials, updated the investigator brochure and patient informed consent forms for ongoing rusfertide trials, proposed new safety and stopping rules in clinical study protocols of our ongoing rusfertide clinical trials, and performed a comprehensive review of our rusfertide safety database. Dosing of patients and enrollment in ongoing clinical trials with rusfertide resumed in the fourth quarter of 2021.  
​
We enrolled 63 patients in the ongoing REVIVE Phase 2 clinical trial of rusfertide in PV prior to the clinical hold, and we are currently enrolling approximately 20 patients to target approximately 50 patients enrolled through the end of a three-year open label extension (“OLE”). Based on ongoing end of Phase 2 feedback provided by the FDA’s Division of Nonmalignant Hematology and written comments from the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), we expect to initiate VERIFY, a global Phase 3 clinical trial of rusfertide in PV in the first quarter of 2022. Patient enrollment into VERIFY is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. In addition, we completed our Phase 2 POC study in HH, our second indication, during the fourth quarter of 2021.

​
Our alpha-4-beta-7 (“α4β7”) antagonist PN-943 and our Interleukin-23 receptor (“IL-23R”) antagonist compound PN-235 are orally delivered investigational drugs that are designed to block biological pathways currently targeted by marketed injectable antibody drugs. Our orally stable peptide approach may offer a targeted therapeutic approach for GI and systemic compartments as needed. We believe that, compared to antibody drugs, these product candidates have the potential to provide improved safety due to minimal exposure in the blood, increased convenience and compliance due to oral delivery, and the opportunity for the earlier introduction of targeted oral therapy. 
PN-943 is an investigational, orally delivered, gut-restricted α4β7 specific integrin antagonist for inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”). We submitted a U.S. Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application with the FDA for PN-943 in December 2019, which took effect in January 2020. During the second quarter of 2020 we initiated IDEAL, a 150 patient Phase 2 trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of PN-943 in patients with moderate to severe UC. This trial includes a 12-week induction period and a 40-week open label extension. Patient enrollment in IDEAL was completed during the first quarter of 2022, and topline data from the study, including the 12-week induction period, is expected in the second quarter of 2022. 
In May 2017, we entered into a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”), a Johnson & Johnson company, to co-develop and co-detail our IL-23R antagonist compounds, including PTG-200 (JNJ-67864238) and certain related compounds for all indications, including IBD. PTG-200 was a first-generation investigational, orally delivered, IL-23R antagonist for the treatment of IBD. The agreement with Janssen was amended in May 2019 to expand the collaboration by supporting efforts towards second-generation IL-23R antagonists; and in July 2021 to, among other things, enable Janssen to independently research and develop collaboration compounds for multiple indications in the IL-23 pathway and further align our financial interests. 
In October 2020, we and Janssen announced the selection of two second-generation IL23-R antagonists for advancement into clinical development, PN-232 (JNJ-75105186) and PN-235 (JNJ-77242113). During the fourth quarter of 2021, following a pre-specified interim analysis criteria, a portfolio decision was made by Janssen to stop further development of both PTG-200 and PN-232 favor of advancing PN-235, based on its superior potency and overall pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. A PN-235 Phase 1 study was completed in Q4 2021. Janssen initiated FRONTIER 1, a Phase 2b clinical study of PN-235 in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, in early 2022, and is expected to initiate a separate Phase 2 study of PN-235 in IBD in the second half of 2022. 
​
During the fourth quarter of 2021, we received a $7.5 million milestone payment from Janssen triggered by the completion of data collection for PN-235 Phase 1 activities. We expect to earn a $25.0 million milestone in connection with the dosing of a third patient in the first Phase 2 study of a second-generation candidate, and a $10.0 million 

5



milestone in connection with the dosing of a third patient in the second Phase 2 study of a second-generation candidate. We remain eligible for up to approximately $900.0 million in development-related milestone payments, in addition to the $87.5 million in milestones already received.
Our clinical assets are all derived from our proprietary discovery platform. Our platform enables us to engineer novel, structurally constrained peptides that are designed to retain key advantages of both orally delivered small molecules and injectable antibody drugs in an effort to overcome many of their limitations as therapeutic agents. Importantly, constrained peptides can be designed to potentially alleviate the fundamental instability inherent in traditional peptides to allow different delivery forms, such as oral, subcutaneous, intravenous, and rectal. We continue to use our peptide technology platform to discover product candidates against targets in disease areas with significant unmet medical needs.
RUSFERTIDE: AN INJECTABLE HEPCIDIN MIMETIC 
Rusfertide, an injectable hepcidin mimetic, was discovered through our peptide technology platform. Hepcidin is a natural hormone that regulates iron metabolism. We are developing rusfertide for the treatment of certain disorders characterized by excessive red blood cells (“RBCs”), iron overload or imbalance. In healthy individuals, hepcidin regulates iron levels by limiting release of iron from macrophages and inhibiting iron absorption from the GI tract. In diseases of excessive RBCs, such as PV, the body consumes iron in the production of cells, leading to iron deficiency which can be exacerbated by phlebotomy. In diseases of iron overload, such as HH, there may be insufficient hepcidin to maintain appropriate iron levels. In other disorders, iron imbalance can benefit from increased levels of hepcidin-like activity to restore proper balance. Native hepcidin is not a practical therapeutic approach because of stability issues, complexity of synthesis and solubility limitations. We developed rusfertide as a more potent, stable, and soluble injectable hepcidin mimetic.
Mechanism of Action and Rationale
The molecular target of the hormone hepcidin is the cellular trans-membrane protein ferroportin, which functions as the major export channel for intracellular iron in splenic macrophages, liver Kupffer cells, hepatocytes, and duodenal enterocytes. Hepcidin binds to the extracellular domain of ferroportin to block the export of iron from inside these cells to the systemic circulation. As a hepcidin mimetic, rusfertide also downregulates ferroportin to control the supply of iron to the bone marrow, thereby normalizing RBC production. In addition, by limiting excessive absorption of dietary iron by enterocytes and rapid sequestration of iron into the macrophages, vital organs can be protected from the accumulation of toxic iron. 
Polycythemia Vera (“PV”) 
PV Overview and Market Opportunity
PV is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized primarily by the overproduction of RBCs. PV is typically caused by a form of Janus Kinase 2 (“JAK2”) mutation. PV is a serious chronic condition as the increased RBC count causes the blood to thicken from increased number of smaller rigid RBCs, putting patients at higher risk of cardiovascular and thrombotic events such as heart attack and stroke. According to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”) guidelines, age and thrombosis history determine a patient’s risk classification as either low-risk or high-risk. Regardless of risk categorization, treatment guidelines for PV are consistent: to control the patient’s hematocrit (RBCs as a percentage of whole blood) below 45% in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular or thrombotic events. PV may progress to myelofibrosis or leukemia.
​
Currently earlier stage patients are typically treated with low dose aspirin and therapeutic phlebotomy alone or hydroxyurea alone or in combination with phlebotomy. At later stages, patients may receive interferons, marketed as Besrami® or Pegasus®, or JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, marketed as Jakafi®. Cytoreductive therapies such as hydroxyurea, interferons and ruxolitinib can have challenging side effect profiles as they reduce all cell types, not just RBCs. Current treatments are effective in some patients but have limitations, such as cytopenia and cancer. We believe there are 

6



substantial PV patient groups that could benefit from a new non-cytoreductive therapeutic option which focuses on RBCs. 
​
PV affects approximately 100,000 patients living in the United States, with a similar prevalence in Europe, representing an estimated market opportunity of approximately $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion. Approximately 14,000 new patients have been diagnosed with PV annually each year since 2017. Patients are typically diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 70 and median survival is approximately 20 years. Analysis of a large medical claims database indicates that the predominant treatment for PV is phlebotomy. Cytoreductive agents, such as hydroxyurea, are also commonly used to control blood count in PV patients. Although NCCN guidelines state that hematocrit levels should be maintained below 45% to reduce risk of cardiovascular and thrombotic events, less than 25% of patients in the large medical claims data set had all hematocrit test results under 45%. This analysis reveals that current therapies do not offer adequate hematocrit control, indicating a significant unmet need in the United States alone where patients may have an elevated risk of cardiovascular and thrombotic events. 
We believe that rusfertide has the potential to provide substantial benefit to patients by offering a treatment focused on managing hematocrit in a consistent and predictable manner, dramatically decreasing the need for phlebotomy. Rusfertide is a non-cytoreductive mimetic of the natural hormone hepcidin, the master regulator of iron homeostasis in the body. Since high RBC production consumes iron stores, PV can cause iron deficiency, which is often exacerbated by phlebotomy. Rusfertide has a unique iron regulatory mechanism, which data from our Phase 2 REVIVE study suggests allows for persistent control of hematocrit without causing iron deficiency. Rusfertide acts by redistributing iron away from the bone marrow, where iron is essential for RBC production, thereby limiting excess RBC production while still providing sufficient iron levels to support other normal cellular and organ functions.
Clinical Development of Rusfertide in PV
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we initiated REVIVE, a Phase 2 study of rusfertide in PV designed to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy in patients requiring phlebotomy. The REVIVE study was expected to enroll approximately 60 patients and consisted of a 16-week open-label dose finding stage every 4 weeks from 10 mg to 80 mg and a 12-week maintenance period at doses which generate desired hematocrit levels, followed by a 12-week randomized and blinded withdrawal stage. The study has an open-label extension for up to three years to monitor long term safety and benefits of the drug. The endpoints of this clinical POC study include measurement of blood parameters (hematocrit and hemoglobin levels), reductions or delay in phlebotomy requirements, and improvements in quality-of-life symptoms.
​
During the first quarter of 2021, we initiated PACIFIC, a Phase 2 study for rusfertide in up to 20 patients diagnosed with PV and with routinely elevated hematocrit levels (>48%). Rusfertide dosed twice a week was able to reduce patient mean hematocrit from 53% to below 45% in less than 8 weeks for most patients and within 4-6 weeks for a few patients. Once the patient’s hematocrit was below 45%, dosing was adjusted and weekly dosing was maintained to control hematocrit without phlebotomy.
​
To date we have received the following designations for rusfertide in PV:
​

● | The FDA granted orphan drug designation for rusfertide for the treatment of PV in June 2020;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The EMA granted orphan drug designation for rusfertide for the treatment of PV in October 2020;

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for rusfertide for the treatment of PV in June 2021.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In consultation with the FDA, we implemented new safety monitoring procedures, including cancer surveillance measures (augmented dermatological examinations) and new stopping rules following a prior 21-day clinical hold on the rusfertide clinical development program. Reenrollment continues with the target of 50 patients completing the full trial.
​
In December 2021, we presented two oral presentations and two posters relating to rusfertide at the American Society for Hematology’s hybrid annual meeting, including updated interim Phase 2 results for the REVIVE and 

7



PACIFIC studies for rusfertide in PV. These preliminary results as of September 2021 demonstrated dramatic decreases in the need for therapeutic phlebotomy in patients with PV, while maintaining control over blood hematocrit levels. 
​

• | We enrolled 63 patients in the ongoing REVIVE Phase 2 clinical trial of rusfertide in PV prior to the clinical hold and we are currently reenrolling approximately 20 additional patients to target approximately 50 patients enrolled through the end of a three-year open label extension. Of the 63 PV patients treated with rusfertide, the vast majority were able to eliminate therapeutic phlebotomies and maintain a target hematocrit level of less than 45 percent. Treatment with rusfertide was also shown to reverse iron deficiency, an important side effect of regular therapeutic phlebotomies as a treatment for PV. Early observations suggest a decreased symptom burden over time, including overall burden (myeloproliferative neoplasm total symptom score), as well as measurements specific to mental function, fatigue and itching.

​

• | Overall, rusfertide therapy resulted in rapid, sustained and durable hematocrit control without clinically meaningful changes in white blood cell and platelet counts. Subjects have been treated up to 1.5 years with the majority of subjects remaining essentially phlebotomy-free. Rusfertide demonstrated similar efficacy in all categories of patients, independent of the PV patient risk category or concurrent therapy with hydroxyurea, interferon or ruxolitinib. Study participation was halted in one patient due to asymptomatic thrombocytosis. One patient developed myeloproliferative neoplasm blast phase which was deemed not to be related to rusfertide.

​

• | Significant adverse events included syncope, peripheral artery aneurism, gastroenteritis, chest pain, AML, squamous cell carcinoma (skin), melanoma & basal cell carcinoma. Injection site reaction (“ISRs”) were most common and associated with 28.1% of injections. All ISRs were transient, and no patient discontinued due to ISR.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Results from the PACIFIC Phase 2 study in rusfertide for PV patients with high hematocrit levels presented at ASH 2021 demonstrated, post induction, weekly rusfertide treatment rapidly controlled hematocrit levels without the need for therapeutic phlebotomy.

Hereditary Hemochromatosis (“HH”) 
HH Overview and Market Opportunity
HH is an inherited blood disorder characterized by excessive absorption of iron due to a deficiency or dysregulation in hepcidin. Approximately one million people in the United States have high iron Fe (“ HFE”) gene mutations consistent with type 1 HFE-related hemochromatosis, the most common form of HH. Of these, 10 to 15 percent develop clinical manifestations of iron overload. Onset of clinical symptoms in HH patients typically occurs between ages 40 and 60, after significant iron accumulation. If left untreated, iron may accumulate in major organs such as the liver, pancreas, heart, and bones, which may lead to complications including diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and cirrhosis. To prevent the development of these associated complications, the goal of treatment in HH patients is to reduce the amount of iron in the body. Per American College of Gastroenterology guidelines, patients with elevated serum ferritin above 200 ng/mL in females and 300 ng/mL in males, along with transferrin saturation (TSAT) above 45%, will require treatment, most commonly phlebotomy. The initial phase of treatment with phlebotomy, called the induction phase, typically requires weekly phlebotomy until serum ferritin levels decrease to the target range of 50 to 100 ng/ml. Once serum ferritin has reached its goal level, HH patients transition to the maintenance phase of therapy, in which they typically require phlebotomy 3-4 times per year to maintain normal serum ferritin levels and prevent iron accumulation in the organs. 
There is no approved medicine for the treatment of HH. Most HH patients who require treatment can be adequately managed with phlebotomy, which is effective in removing excess iron and preventing most of the complications associated with iron overload. There are small sub-populations of patients who require treatment for HH but who are intolerant or resistant to phlebotomy. HH patients who cannot be managed with phlebotomy are left at an increased risk of iron accumulation and associated complications, therefore, additional treatment options may be needed for these populations. 
Clinical Development of Rusfertide in HH
In January 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 study of rusfertide in HH. This study was an open label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the effects of rusfertide in 16 adult patients over 24 weeks of treatment. Guidelines for HH focused on controlling baseline transferrin saturation (“TSAT”) and ferritin to prevent long-term complications. Given the TSAT reductions from rusfertide observed to date in both healthy volunteers and beta-thalassemia and PV patients, as well as regulation of organ iron content in a mouse model of HH, we believe that a significant reduction in phlebotomy is possible with rusfertide. The endpoints of this POC study included change in TSAT and serum iron levels, reductions in phlebotomy requirements and an assessment of participant-reported outcomes. 
We completed our Phase 2 POC study in HH during the fourth quarter of 2021. An abstract highlighting positive preliminary data our Phase 2 study of rusfertide in HH was orally presented at The Liver Meeting® 2021, hosted by the AASLD, which took place virtually in November 2021. In December 2021, we presented a poster on rusfertide in HH at the ASH 2021 Annual Meeting. These results from the Phase 2 study of rusfertide in HH demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of phlebotomies, lower serum iron and TSAT levels, and a reduction of liver iron content. Administration of rusfertide was generally well tolerated in patients with HH, with the most common adverse events being injection site reactions that were mild or moderate.
Based on the data described above, we are exploring clinical studies in HH sub-populations. Additional studies are required to further characterize the safety, efficacy and long-term outcomes in rusfertide for HH patients.
OVERVIEW OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE 
IBD is a group of chronic autoimmune and inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine, consisting primarily of UC and CD. In UC, inflammation may be limited to part of the colon or extend through its entirety. UC is primarily characterized by ulceration of the intestinal surface, accompanied by rectal bleeding and frequent, urgent bowel movements. CD occurs anywhere along the GI tract, commonly affecting the small intestine and the proximal large intestine. CD complications may include strictures and fistula, which penetrate all layers of the intestine. UC is 

9



usually diagnosed earlier than CD due to bleeding symptoms. Patients with CD may initially present with abdominal pain, fatigue and anorexia, which can be misdiagnosed. Both diseases’ peak diagnosis years are in young adulthood and are found about equally in both males and females. Management is lifelong and affects school attendance, graduation rates, childbearing and work productivity. IBD prevalence is increasing worldwide and is correlated with the adoption of western diets and lifestyle, as well as genetic factors (5 to 20% of affected patients have a first degree relative with the disease). 
​
Market Overview 
According to the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America, there are more than 1.6 million IBD patients in the United States alone, an increase of approximately 200,000 patients since 2011. As many as 70,000 new cases of IBD are diagnosed in the United States each year, and there may be as many as 80,000 children in the United States with IBD. In 2020, GlobalData estimated that the UC market was approximately $6.8 billion across eight major markets: United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom and Japan. This is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 6.0% to $12.3 billion by 2029. In 2020, GlobalData estimated that the CD market reached approximately $7.4 billion across those same eight major markets and is expected to grow approximately 5.5% per year to $12.6 billion by 2029.
For many years, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (“TNF-α”) antibody drugs were the primary treatment for moderate-to-severe IBD. Humira® and Remicade® are injectable and infused, respectively. Approximately one third of IBD patients do not respond to TNF-α antibody drugs and approximately another 30% to 40% become refractory within the first year of treatment. Additionally, TNF-α antibody drugs may predispose patients to an increased risk of serious infection and the development of anti-drug antibodies, which over time can cause loss of drug response. More recently, antibody products focused on potentially safer mechanisms of action have been gaining market share. One such product is Takeda Pharmaceuticals’ Entyvio®, which targets the α4β7 integrin pathway. Takada Pharmaceuticals reported 2021 sales of Entyvio® of approximately $5.0 billion. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara®, which targets the Interleukin 12 (“IL-12”) and Interleukin 23 (“IL-23”) pathways, has gained significant traction. Johnson & Johnson global sales of Stelara® (approved for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, moderate-to-severe CD and UC) exceeded $9.2 billion in 2021. 
Current Standard of Care in IBD 
In recent years, treatment of IBD has evolved from a focus on successful symptom management to an emphasis on modifying the underlying disease to achieve long-term remission. While available treatments exist for moderate-to-severe IBD, there continues to be a significant medical need for novel, efficacious, safe and convenient treatments. New technologies and outcome measures have been developed to improve staging definitions and assessments of treatment benefit. Nonetheless, halting or reversing IBD progression has not yet been achieved with any single agent therapy, and attaining and maintaining long-term remission in most patients remains a significant unmet medical need. 
Biosimilar infliximab and other tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitors are the first line standard of care in moderate-to-severe IBD. Anti-TNFs bind to and neutralize a central pro-inflammatory cytokine in the gut via systemic immunosuppression. As a result, they can be associated with infection and malignancy risk. Although the magnitude of these risks is relatively low, they are significant for the young IBD population who must continue on lifelong treatment. In addition, more than 10% of patients treated with anti-TNF agents lose response with each year of treatment. In 2014, a novel anti-trafficking mechanism launched with vedolizumab, marketed as Entyvio®, which blocks migration of leukocytes into the gut via α4β7 integrins. This mechanism remains the only true “gut selective” approach in the IBD market today, although formulation technologies can limit systemic exposure from orally delivered agents. Entyvio® has shown an excellent safety profile, although it requires intravenous administration. Entyvio® was followed by the launch of ustekinumab, marketed as Stelara®, in CD in 2016, which blocks inflammation produced through the IL-12 and IL-23 pathways, and tofacitinib, marketed as Xeljanz®, an orally delivered pan-Janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitor approved in UC. 
A head-to-head trial called VARSITY comparing the long-term safety and efficacy of an anti-integrin and anti-TNFs has been completed. Entyvio® demonstrated superior rates of clinical remission and endoscopic improvement compared with Humira®, the market leader in the TNF inhibitor class. The first formal combination trials in IBD were 

10



initiated in the last year, adding new mechanisms such as integrin inhibitors or IL-23 inhibitors to anti-TNFs. Most IBD experts now believe that combining treatment classes with additive or synergistic mechanisms of action will be required to attain the disease-modifying effects and lasting remissions in a larger group of patients documented in other areas of immunology, such as psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis.
We believe the development of new, potent and targeted orally delivered therapies for IBD may offer safer and more effective treatment options, alone or in combination, for moderate-to-severe IBD patients. In addition, many clinicians continue to advocate for earlier introduction of targeted therapeutics in mild-to-moderate IBD in order to prevent disease progression and irreversible gastrointestinal damage. Orally delivered peptide drugs PN-943 and PN-235 work on the same specific validated targets as FDA-approved injectable antibodies and have the potential to offer improved safety and compliance and to minimize the risk of immunogenicity associated with antibodies. We believe that these product candidates, if approved, have the potential to be used more broadly, including treatment of mild-to-moderate IBD.
Our IBD Solution: Orally Delivered Peptides as Targeted Therapies 
For the IBD targets of interest, the size and nature of our peptides are carefully selected and modified so as to acquire the desired potency and specificity, and also to largely restrict their presence to the GI and systemic tissue compartments as needed when administered orally. These features translate to orally delivered, selective and potent peptide drug candidates with specific advantages compared to antibody drugs:

● | Oral administration. We are developing our peptide therapeutics in a convenient capsule or tablet form intended for oral administration, particularly in combination with other oral therapies. We also believe oral administration may reduce many of the problems and limitations associated with injections or infusions, including injection site pain and local reactions, inconvenience, anxiety, high rates of immunogenicity and potential safety risks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potential for improved safety and tolerability compared to antibody drugs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Oral and GI-restricted delivery minimizes systemic exposure in the blood. Oral and GI-restricted delivery results in lower drug levels in the blood that may provide the potential for an enhanced safety profile over antibody drugs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Peptides can be cleared more quickly from systemic circulation. Small molecules and peptides below a size threshold can be rapidly cleared from blood circulation by kidney filtration and excretion. Rapid clearance may be beneficial especially if patients need to discontinue therapy. In contrast, antibody drugs, because of their long plasma half-life, may take months to clear from blood circulation, leaving patients exposed to continued or increased safety risk.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The likelihood of much lower immunogenicity of small stable peptides compared to antibody drugs reduces the risk of loss of response. We believe that anti-drug antibodies are less likely to be elicited against constrained peptides, due to their small size, lack of epitope density, resistance to proteolysis, oral tolerance, and minimal systemic absorption.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potential for localized delivery to site of disease. We believe oral dosing of GI-restricted peptides results in substantially higher drug concentrations in the diseased GI tissue compartment compared to injectable antibody drugs. This targeted delivery to the site of action may lead to more immediate and significant target engagement at the site of active disease in the GI tissue compartment with the potential for improved efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In chronic GI diseases such as IBD, we believe that our orally delivered, peptide product candidates may offer improved delivery and the potential for improved safety and tolerability that may provide an overall benefit to patients, payors, and physicians.

PN-943: AN ORALLY DELIVERED α4β7 INTEGRIN ANTAGONIST 
PN-943, a second-generation, orally delivered, gut-restricted α4β7 specific integrin antagonist, was discovered through our peptide technology platform and is being developed initially for patients with moderate-to-severe UC. Α4β7 integrin is considered to be one of the most GI-specific biological targets for IBD due to its binding to MAdCAM-1, an extracellular protein that resides mostly in the GI vasculature. Like Entyvio®, which is dosed as an infusion and as an injectable antibody drug, PN-943 specifically inhibits α4β7 integrin. We have leveraged the development and regulatory path of Entyvio® and other approved antibody drugs for IBD to help inform the design of our clinical development studies. 
Mechanism of Action and Rationale
Integrins, such as α4β7, are transmembrane proteins that regulate cellular movement into extravascular tissue and play an important role in modulating the inflammatory reaction in the gut. The α4β7 integrin is expressed on the surface of T cells, immune cells that help defend against foreign and potentially harmful substances that enter the body. The development of IBD is driven by the migration of α4β7 T cells into the GI tissue compartment and their subsequent activation within the GI tissue compartment. The entry of α4β7 T cells into the GI tissue compartment is facilitated by the protein-protein interactions between the α4β7 integrin and its corresponding ligand, MAdCAM-1, which is primarily expressed in the GI tissue compartment. Hence, the binding of α4β7 to MAdCAM-1 can be categorized as a GI-specific interaction and has been identified as an IBD-specific targeted therapeutic approach. By blocking the binding of α4β7 integrin to MAdCAM-1, PN-943 may prevent trafficking and activation of T cells, thereby reducing the inflammation that leads to the clinical manifestations and long-term implications of UC.
Α4β7 for IBD is targeted by Entyvio®, which has demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe UC and CD. Since PN-943 targets the same biological pathway as Entyvio®, we utilized similar PD-based POC in our pre-clinical studies and Phase 1 clinical trial to inform and guide our Phase 2 development program. We sourced these PD biomarker assays from public scientific publications and do not maintain any contractual arrangement providing access to this information with the makers of these marketed products.
PN-943 Pre-Clinical Proof-of-Concept Studies
We have completed extensive pre-clinical studies of PN-943 in which we established pharmacodynamic target engagement POC, including effects on receptor occupancy, T cell trafficking and mucosal healing in rodents and monkeys. Pre-clinical data indicated that PN-943 may be a more potent α4β7 integrin antagonist compound than PTG-100, our first-generation α4β7 inhibitor, without sacrificing its other positive attributes, such as selectivity and tolerability. PTG-100 shares the same α4β7 integrin target as Entyvio® for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC and CD. We completed extensive pre-clinical studies of PTG-100 in which we established pharmacological POC and completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in Australia in 2016. 
PN-943’s Phase 1 Clinical Trial Overview 
We completed a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of PN-943 in normal healthy male volunteers in Australia in 2019. The Phase 1 single ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) components were conducted with a solution-based liquid formulation. In addition to determining the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics of PN-943, the SAD and MAD components of the trial evaluated PD-based POC through the assessment of α4β7 receptor occupancy and α4β7 target expression that indicate target engagement on peripheral blood memory T cells similar to what was done in the pre-clinical studies and in the Phase 1 trial with PTG-100. In the clinical trial, dose escalation proceeded from 100 mg up to 1,400 mg for the SAD portion and 1,000 mg for the MAD portion. The administration of PN-943 was well-tolerated in the Phase 1 study.
 We reported results of the SAD part of the study during the second quarter of 2019 and the MAD part of the study during the third quarter of 2019. The pharmacodynamic results of target engagement were supportive of the three-fold higher potency of PN-943 as compared to PTG-100 and saturation at 1000 mg. This is consistent with data from pre-clinical studies and confirmed by this Phase 1 pharmacodynamic data. We believe this links PN-943 to greater 

12



probability of success in a Phase 2 trial based on signs of clinical efficacy of PTG-100 in the Phase 2 PROPEL trial in UC patients. 
PN-943 Phase 2 Clinical Trial Overview
We submitted a U.S. IND with the FDA for PN-943 in December 2019, which took effect in January 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, we initiated a global, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study called IDEAL evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of PN-943 in approximately 150 patients with moderate-to-severe UC (Figure 3). Patient enrollment in IDEAL was completed during the first quarter of 2022, and topline data from the study, including the 12-week induction period, is expected in the second quarter of 2022.

PN-235: AN ORALLY DELIVERED IL-23R ANTAGONIST 
Janssen License and Collaboration Agreement
We have a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Janssen to research, develop and co-detail our IL-23 receptor (“IL-23R”) antagonist compounds for all indications, including IBD. The agreement with Janssen was amended in May 2019 to expand the collaboration by supporting efforts towards second-generation IL-23R antagonists; and in July 2021 to, among other things, enable Janssen to independently research and develop collaboration compounds for multiple indications in the IL-23 pathway and further align our financial interests. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Overview” and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
In October 2020, we and Janssen announced the selection of two second-generation IL23-R antagonists for advancement into clinical development, PN-232 and PN-235. During the fourth quarter of 2021, following a pre-specified interim analysis criteria, a portfolio decision was made by Janssen to stop further development of both PTG-200 and PN-232 in favor of advancing PN-235, based on its superior potency and overall pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. A PN-235 Phase 1 study was completed in Q4 2021. Janssen initiated FRONTIER 1, a Phase 2b clinical study of PN-235 in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, in early 2022, and is expected to initiate a separate Phase 2 study of PN-235 in IBD in the second half of 2022. Janssen is primarily responsible for the conduct of all Phase 2 trials and we were primarily responsible for the conduct of the second-generation Phase 1 studies.
Mechanism of Action and Rationale
IL-23 is a member of the IL-12 family of cytokines with pro-inflammatory and immune stimulatory properties. Cytokines are cell signaling proteins that are released by cells and affect the behavior of other cells. Binding of the IL-23 

13



ligand to the IL-23R receptor leads to an expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the mucosal autocrine cascade that is an important pathway of many inflammatory diseases, including IBD. Furthermore, genetic analyses of IBD patients have implicated IL-23R mutations as a risk factor associated with susceptibility to IBD. The infused antibody drug Stelara® (marketed for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, UC and CD) is a p40 antagonist antibody that inhibits both the IL-23 and IL-12 pathways. Next-generation IBD antibody drugs, such as guselkumab, target the p19 subunit of the IL-23 ligand and are specific inhibitors of the IL-23 pathway, which is believed to be an important driver of local IBD pathology. IL-12 is believed to be important in immune surveillance against the development of infections and malignancies.
We believe that our orally delivered IL-23R antagonist PN-235 may be a potent inhibitor of the IL-23 pathway for the treatment of IBD and non-IBD indications. By targeting IL-23R with PN-235, we believe PN-235 may restore proper immune function while minimizing the risk of systemic side effects. Several key cell types that reside in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (“GALT”), including T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and natural killer cells, increase their expression of IL-23R during the progression of IBD. Therefore, the high concentrations of PN-235 in GALT will facilitate access and binding to IL-23R expressed in the same tissue with the potential for concomitant efficacy benefits.
First-Generation IL-23R Antagonist PTG-200
PTG-200 was a first-generation investigational, orally delivered, IL-23R antagonist for the treatment of IBD. We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of PTG-200 in Australia during the fourth quarter of 2018. The Phase 1 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, SAD and MAD-escalation trial in 80 normal healthy volunteers. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included the identification of the maximally tolerated dose and the evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters. Results of the Phase 1 study demonstrated that administration of PTG-200 was well-tolerated. No serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were consistent with the GI-restricted design of PTG-200. 
Janssen submitted an IND for PTG-200 in CD during the second quarter of 2019, which took effect in July 2019. Janssen initiated a Phase 2 clinical study of PTG-200 in CD called PRISM in the fourth quarter of 2019. The global, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of oral administration of PTG-200 in 90 patients with moderate-to-severe CD. This study was discontinued during the fourth quarter of 2021 in favor of focusing on the development of second-generation antagonists.
Second-Generation IL23-R Antagonist PN-235 
PN-235, an orally delivered IL-23R specific antagonist for the treatment of IBD and non-IBD indications, was discovered through our peptide technology platform. IL-23, a member of the IL-12 family of pro-inflammatory cytokines, is a protein that regulates inflammatory and immune function and plays a key role in the development of IBD. By blocking IL-23R, we hope to improve disease symptoms while potentially minimizing the risk of systemic side effects. 
​
A Phase 1 study was initiated for PN-235 in December 2020. The Phase 1 for PN-235 study was designed to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of PN-235 in 107 healthy volunteers. The study was conducted in three parts: a SAD component, a MAD component, and a randomized, crossover solid dose comparison component. The primary endpoint was safety as measured by number and severity of adverse events. Secondary outcomes included pharmacokinetics measurements of peak concentration and area under the curve. The Phase 1 study was completed in September 2021. Results of the Phase 1 study demonstrated that administration of PN-235 was well-tolerated. No serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of PN-235 were consistent with those predicted by preclinical studies. FRONTIER 1, a Phase 2b study in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, was initiated in early 2022, and a Phase 2 study in IBD is expected to initiate in the second half of 2022. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis, which is recognized as the most prevalent immune-mediated inflammatory disease, involving skin and joints and associated with abnormalities of other systems. Although the condition is not life-threatening, it is difficult to treat and response rates vary widely.

OUR PEPTIDE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM 

Our proprietary technology platform is purposefully built to exploit the advantages of constrained peptides, which are much smaller than antibody-based drugs and may be delivered orally but are big enough to bind and block the difficult targets that antibodies bind and modulate. The platform has been successfully applied to a diverse set of biological targets that has led to several pre-clinical and clinical stage peptide-based new chemical entities, including our clinical stage product candidates, for a variety of clinical indications. Our platform is comprised of a series of tools and methods, including a combination of molecular design, phage display, stability assays, medicinal chemistry, surrogate biomarkers, formulations, in vitro biochemical, cell and tissue-based assays, and in vivo pharmacology and pharmacokinetic approaches. We apply this platform to the discovery and development of constrained peptides as new drug candidates.
The platform is used to develop potential drug candidates (agonists and antagonists): (i) using the structure of a target, when available, (ii) de novo when no target structure exists, or (iii) from publicly disclosed peptide starting points. In a structure-based approach, our proprietary molecular design software and structural database of several thousand constrained peptides, termed Vectrix™, are screened to identify suitable scaffolds. The scaffolds identified form the basis of designing and constructing the first set of phage or chemical libraries. The initial hits are identified by either panning or screening such libraries, respectively. When structural information is unavailable for a target, hits are identified by panning a set of 34 proprietary cluster-based phage libraries consisting of millions of constrained peptides. Once the hits are identified, they are optimized using a set of peptide, peptide mimetic and medicinal chemistry techniques that include the incorporation of new or manipulation of existing cyclization-constraints, as well as natural or unnatural amino acids and chemical conjugation or acylation techniques. These techniques are applied to optimize potency, selectivity, stability, exposure and ultimately efficacy. For rusfertide, hit discovery and optimization relied exclusively on medicinal and computational chemistry, with no phage display, to develop potent and selective injectable candidates with enhanced stability and exposure in blood. For injectable products, stability in blood is determined using in vitro assay techniques to identify chemical and biological sites of degradation, which are then optimized while still maintaining potency and selectivity. Conjugation strategies are used to optimize the exposure of the injected peptide. For PN-943 and PN-235, phage display is tightly coupled to medicinal chemistry, structural biology and oral stability techniques to develop potent, selective and orally delivered molecules. Oral stability is profiled in a series of in vitro and ex vivo assays that portray the chemical and metabolic barriers a peptide will encounter as it transits the GI and systemic compartments as needed. These metabolically labile spots in the peptides are optimized using medicinal chemistry-based approaches to engineer oral stability while maintaining selectivity and potency. Various in vivo pharmacology tools are then used to quantify peptide exposure in relevant GI and systemic compartments as needed organs and tissues. This data can be used to optimize required exposure over the required time frame to achieve in vivo efficacy. This is complemented by formulation technologies to enhance GI and systemic exposure by exploiting the intrinsic stability of our oral peptides. Finally, various biomarkers are also developed to correlate exposure with efficacy to guide candidate selection, dose selection and provide preliminary proof-of-concept of target engagement in clinical trials.
Discovery and Preclinical Activities
We believe we have built a versatile, well-validated and unique discovery platform. For example, this peptide technology platform has been used to develop product candidates for diverse target classes including G-protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, transporters, cytokines and their receptors for a variety of therapeutic areas. In the future we may tackle other GI and blood disorders and expand our technology platform to provide potential opportunities to pursue a wider variety of diseases that may include topical and systemic approaches. As an example, the gut may communicate with the immune, central nervous, and endocrine systems, providing the potential of our GI-restricted approach to treat systemic autoimmune, metabolic, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. We also intend to progress our platform to achieve systemic bioavailability and activity with oral peptides, macrocycles and peptidomimetics, thereby enabling us to address systemic diseases. Examples of this approach are our preclinical stage program to identify an orally active hepcidin mimetic, as was reported at the American Society for Hematology’s virtual annual meeting in December 2020, and the discovery and development of PN-235, our IL-23R antagonist in collaboration with Janssen. We believe the oral hepcidin mimetic will be complementary to the injectable rusfertide for offering the best treatment options for PV, HH and other potential erythropoietic and iron imbalance disorders.

Competition 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge and experience provide us with certain competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. 
Ruxolitinib, marketed as Jakafi®, was approved in 2014 for the treatment of adults with polycythemia vera who have inadequate response to or are intolerant to HU. Approximately 5,300 PV patients are treated with Jakafi each year. Besremi®, a ropeginterferon alfa-2b product indicated for the treatment of adults with polycythemia vera, was approved with a black box warning in November 2021. Besremi is currently undergoing U.S. commercial launch with uncertain uptake at the present time. 
There are currently no approved orally delivered peptide-based α4β7 or IL-23R products for IBD. Our principal competition with similar mechanisms of action in the treatment of IBD will come from companies with injectable agents in the anti-integrin class and the anti-IL-23 class that are or will be approved by 2028, including: 

● | Takeda’s vedolizumab (Entyvio®) IV and SC;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Abbvie’s risankizumab (Skyrizi®) SC (UC and CD Phase 3)
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | Janssen’s guselkumab (Tremfya®) SC (UC and CD); and
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Lilly’s mirikizumab (UC and CD).
--+---------------------------------

In addition, orally delivered agents with novel mechanisms of action that are approved for or in development and may be approved for UC and/or CD prior to or shortly after the launch of our product candidates can have significant impact in the competitive environment, including:

● | JAK inhibitors: The pan-JAK tofacitinib (Xeljanz®) is approved in UC; next-generation selective JAK1/3 inhibitors, including Abbvie’s upadacitinib (Rinvoq®) (UC and CD) and Pfizer’s abrocitinib (Cibinqo®) (UC); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | S1P1 receptor modulators: Bristol Myers Squibb ozanimod (Zeposia®) is approved in UC. Second-generation agents including Pfizer’s etrasimod (Phase 3 UC, Phase 2b CD) are in development.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Morphic Therapeutics is developing MORF-057, an oral small molecule targeting α4β7 entering Phase 2 development in UC. Anti-IL-23 antibodies are also demonstrating positive data in IBD. Many other agents are in early- stage development in IBD, including injectable anti-TLIA antibodies by Pfizer and Prometheus.
COVID-19 Business Update
We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic on our business and have taken and continue to take proactive efforts designed to protect the health and safety of our patients, study investigators, clinical research staff and employees, and to maintain business continuity. Our laboratory facilities are open for research activities with heightened safety measures designed to minimize occupational exposure and reduce transmission of COVID-19 within our workplace. Our non-laboratory employees telecommute at least part-time. We have experienced relatively minor impacts on productivity overall, which were experienced primarily in as our personnel adjusted to working remotely in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Enrollment in certain of our clinical studies has been adversely affected by the pandemic. It is possible the pandemic will have a more significant negative impact on our business in the future, depending on the depth of the effects and the duration of the crisis, including the development and spread of COVID-19 variants. We cannot predict whether these trends will continue or be exacerbated. For information regarding the current and potential impacts of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview” elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Material Agreements 
Janssen License and Collaboration Agreement
On July 27, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated License and Collaboration Agreement (“Restated Agreement”) with Janssen. The Restated Agreement amends and restates the License and Collaboration Agreement, dated May 26, 2017, by and between us and Janssen (as amended by the First Amendment thereto, effective May 7, 2019, the “Original Agreement”). Janssen is a related party to us as Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc., a significant stockholder of ours, and Janssen are both subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson. The Original Agreement became effective on July 13, 2017. Upon the effectiveness of the Original Agreement, we received a non-refundable, upfront cash payment of $50.0 million from Janssen. Upon the effectiveness of the First Amendment in 2019, we received a $25.0 million payment from Janssen in 2019. We received a $5.0 million payment triggered by the successful nomination of a second-generation IL-23R antagonist development compound during the first quarter of 2020, and we received a $7.5 million payment for completion of data collection activities for the first Phase 1 clinical trial of a second-generation compound during the fourth quarter of 2021. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Overview” and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Zealand Pharma A/S
​
In June 2012, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Zealand Pharma A/S (“Zealand”) to identify, optimize and develop novel disulfide-rich peptides to discover a hepcidin mimetic. We amended this agreement on February 28, 2014, at which point Protagonist assumed responsibility for the development program. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments” and Note 7 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
​
Intellectual Property 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of peptide-based therapeutics that may be important for the development of our business. We will also take advantage of regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. For more information, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
We own or co-own 15 issued U.S. patents, over 60 granted ex-U.S. patents, and numerous U.S. and ex-U.S. patent applications related to our clinical assets. We possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the discovery, development and commercialization of peptide based therapeutic products. Our proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, is generally directed to, for example, peptide-based therapeutic compounds and compositions, methods of using these peptide-based therapeutic compounds and compositions to treat or prevent disease, methods of manufacturing peptide-based therapeutic compounds and compositions, and other 

17



proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product development candidates. Specific patents and patent applications are directed to compositions of α4β7 integrin peptides, IL-23R antagonist peptides, and hepcidin and enkephalin mimetics peptides, as well as methods of synthesizing and using these peptides to treat inflammatory disorders. Applications are currently pending in the United States and other major jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Japan, and Europe. We expect our patents and patent applications, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from October 2033 to July 2041 (excluding possible patent term extensions).
Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications in order to protect our clinical assets and related peptide-based drug technologies.
We also license patents and patent applications directed to processes and methods related to our technology platform. These patents have issued in the United States and other major jurisdictions, including Australia and Europe. Some licensed patents are expired, and others are expected to expire before or by February 2023. Material aspects of our technology platform are protected by trade secrets and confidentiality agreements.
In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of pre-clinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop products based on our proprietary intellectual property.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
The term of a patent that covers an FDA approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
Trade Secrets
We rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology, particularly in relation to our technology platform. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

​
Manufacturing 
​
We contract with third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for pre-clinical and clinical studies and eventually for commercial supplies, and intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and we have no plans to build any owned clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that the use of contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) eliminates the need for us to directly invest in manufacturing facilities, equipment and additional staff. We have established a global supply chain for raw material, active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”), drug product manufacturing and distribution. We work with contract manufacturers in the United States, Europe and Asia. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, our personnel and consultants have extensive manufacturing and quality control experience overseeing CMOs. We regularly consider second source or back-up manufacturers for both API and drug product manufacturing. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met the manufacturing requirements for our product candidates. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing needed quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands, and we have selected CMOs that can manufacture our product candidates for our ongoing and planned clinical trials as well as commercial supplies. We currently engage CMOs on a “fee for services” basis for our current development and clinical supplies. 
Government Regulation
​
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation
​
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDAs”), withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19




● | submission to the FDA of an NDA (or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for a biologic product);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements and the clinical protocol; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Pre-clinical Studies
​
Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
​
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND (or equivalent submission ex-US). In addition, an IRB or ethics committee (“EC”) must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial at each institution participating in the clinical trial before it commences at that site. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the investigational drug product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate labeling information (labeling) for the safe and efficacious administration for the labeling of the product.

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or EC can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
​
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (“PREA”), as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval 

21



letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or pre-clinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track Designation
​
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides additional opportunities for interaction with the FDA’s review team and may allow for rolling review of NDA components before the completed application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. The FDA may decide to rescind the fast track designation if it determines that the qualifying criteria no longer apply.
​
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
​
A sponsor can request designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval and priority review. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. The FDA may decide to rescind the breakthrough designation if it determines that the qualifying criteria no longer apply.
Orphan Designation
​
The FDA may grant orphan designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan designation must be requested before 

22



submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
In the United States, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
Post-Approval Requirements
​
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under an REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23




● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved prescribing information. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Coverage and Reimbursement
​
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the cost of such products will be covered and adequately reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and/or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services by challenging the prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The coverage determination process can be a time-consuming and costly process that may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained or applied consistently. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for health care providers or less profitable than alternative treatments, or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use.
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on certain companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The ACA also increased the Medicaid rebate rate and expanded the rebate program to include Medicaid managed care organizations. It also contains substantial new provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health care spending, enhance remedies against health care fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the health care industry, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business. 
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain requirements mandated by the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been enacted. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, included a provision repealing, 

24



effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and the medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurance tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”, and increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in the Medicare Part D program. These and any other legislation or healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration may impact the ACA and our business. There may also be further challenges to the ACA, and new laws may also result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding.



Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration’s proposals The FDA also released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers.
 On November 20, 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule, and in August 2021, the Biden administration issued an interim rule that would rescind the most favored nation drug pricing rule. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare therapies. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or foreign, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions foreign, federal, state, or private payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to any such health care reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and other cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
Other Health Care Laws and Compliance Requirements
​
We will also be subject to health care regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business once our products are approved. The laws that may affect 

25



our ability to operate include, but are not limited to, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; the criminal health care fraud statutes under HIPAA also prohibits persons and entities from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services; the federal health care programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws that prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid; and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the HHS information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and, beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. We may be subject to state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, we may be subject to reporting requirements under state transparency laws, as well as state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to health care providers and entities. In addition, certain states and local jurisdictions require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion of products from reimbursement under U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
​
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission and approval of a clinical trial application much like the IND but specific to a clinical trial prior to the commencement of the human clinical study.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, the protection of personal data, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign 

26



regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
Human Capital 
​
As of December 31, 2021, we had 118 full-time equivalent employees, 92 of whom were in research and development, of which four hold an M.D. and 23 hold Ph.D. degrees. The remaining 26 employees worked in finance, legal, business development, human resources and administrative support, of which one holds a Ph.D. 104 of our full-time equivalent employees are located in the United States and 14 are located in Australia. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. We track and report internally on key talent metrics including workforce demographics, diversity data and the status of open positions. We are committed to equality, inclusion and diversity in the workplace. As of December 31, 2021, nearly 65% of our workforce identify as members of underrepresented ethnic communities and 51% identify as female. We strive to interview diverse candidates for our open positions.
Attracting, developing and retaining talented employees to support the growth of our business is an integral part of our human capital strategy and critical to our long-term success. We continue to seek additions to our staff, although the competition in our industry and in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters is located is significant. The principal purpose of our equity incentive and annual bonus programs is to attract, retain and motivate personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards. As a biopharmaceutical company, we recognize the importance of access to high quality healthcare and as such we cover 100% of our employees’ monthly healthcare premiums. We offer a package of competitive employee benefits, including 401(k) plan matching contributions and an employee stock purchase plan. 
We have a performance development review process in which managers provide regular feedback to assist with the development of our employees, including the use of individual plans to assist with career development. We also invest in the growth and development of our employees through various training and development programs that help build and strengthen our employees’ leadership and professional skills. Approximately 20% of our employees are promoted each year. This reflects the quality and readiness of our people to take on new roles, as well as our intentional focus on growing and developing careers, as well as promoting within.
Safeguarding the health and safety of our employees is a top priority. We are committed to providing a safe working environment for all of our employees. Our cross-functional safety committee meets regularly to discuss policies and protocols, strategic planning, business continuity and other matters related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impacts on our company, employees and external stakeholders. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having our non-laboratory employees work remotely at least part-time, while implementing additional safety measures for laboratory and other employees continuing critical on-site work. To support our employees personally and professionally, we have Employee Assistance Programs to address employee challenges and needs.
