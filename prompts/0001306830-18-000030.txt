Acetic acid, VAM and acetic anhydride are global businesses, and we generally supply our customers under a mix of short- and long-term agreements. Acetic acid, VAM and acetic anhydride customers produce polymers used in water-based paints, adhesives, paper coatings, polyesters, film modifiers, pharmaceuticals, cellulose acetate and textiles. We have long-standing relationships with most of these customers.

Solvents and derivatives are sold to a diverse group of regional and multinational customers under multi-year contracts and on the basis of long-standing relationships. Solvents and derivatives customers are primarily engaged in the production of paints, coatings and adhesives. We manufacture formaldehyde for our own use as well as for sale to a few regional customers that include manufacturers in the wood products and chemical derivatives industries. Specialty solvents are sold globally to a wide variety of customers, primarily in the coatings and resins and the specialty products industries. These products serve global regions in the synthetic lubricant, agrochemical, rubber processing and other specialty chemical areas.
Pricing of acetic acid, VAM and other acetyl products reflects changes in the cost of raw materials. Therefore, in general, there is a direct correlation between the cost of raw materials and our net sales for most intermediate chemistry products. This impact to pricing typically lags changes in raw material costs over months or quarters.
Other Activities
Other Activities primarily consists of corporate center costs, including administrative activities such as finance, information technology and human resource functions, interest income and expense associated with our financing activities and results of our captive insurance companies. Our two wholly-owned captive insurance companies are a key component of our global risk management program, as well as a form of self-insurance for our liability and workers compensation risks. The captive insurance companies retain risk at levels approved by management and obtain reinsurance coverage from third parties to limit the net risk retained. One of the captive insurance companies also insures certain third-party risks. Other Activities also includes the interest cost, expected return on assets and net actuarial gains and losses components of our net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans, which are not allocated to our business segments. Ongoing merger, acquisition and integration related costs are also included in Other Activities.
Strategic Affiliates
Our strategic affiliates represent an important component of our strategy for accelerated growth and global expansion. We have a substantial portfolio of affiliates in various regions, including Asia-Pacific, North America and the Middle East. These affiliates, some of which date back as far as the 1960s, have sizeable operations and are significant within their industries.
With shared characteristics such as products, applications and manufacturing technology, these strategic affiliates complement and extend our technology and specialty materials portfolio. We have historically entered into these investments to gain access to local demand, minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas we believe have significant future business potential. Depending on the level of investment and other factors, we account for our strategic affiliates using either the equity method or cost method of accounting.
Our strategic affiliates contribute substantial earnings and cash flows to us. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our equity method strategic affiliates generated combined sales of $2.3 billion, resulting in our recording $157 million of equity in net earnings of affiliates and $96 million of dividends.

National Methanol Company (Ibn Sina). National Methanol Company represents approximately 1% of the world's methanol production capacity and is one of the world's largest producers of methyl tertiary-butyl ether, a gasoline additive. Its production facilities are located in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Basic Industries Corporation ("SABIC") is responsible for all product marketing. Methanol is a key feedstock for POM production and is produced by our Ibn Sina affiliate which provides an economic hedge against raw material costs in our engineered materials business.
Ibn Sina has constructed a 50,000 metric ton POM production facility in Saudi Arabia. The new facility will supply POM to support Advanced Engineered Materials' future growth plans as well as our venture partners' regional business development and was declared commercially operational in the fourth quarter of 2017. Upon successful startup of the POM facility, our indirect economic interest in Ibn Sina increased from 25% to 32.5%. SABIC's economic interest will remain unchanged.
KEPCO. KEPCO is the leading producer of POM in South Korea. KEPCO has polyacetal production facilities in Ulsan, South Korea, compounding facilities for PBT and nylon in Pyongtaek, South Korea, and participates with Polyplastics and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. in a world-scale POM facility in Nantong, China.
Polyplastics. Polyplastics is a leading supplier of engineered plastics. Polyplastics is a manufacturer and/or marketer of POM, LCP and PPS, with principal production facilities located in Japan and Malaysia.
Fortron Industries LLC. Fortron Industries LLC ("Fortron") is a leading global producer of PPS, sold under the Fortron® brand, which is used in a wide variety of automotive and other applications, especially those requiring heat and/or chemical resistance. Fortron's facility is located in Wilmington, North Carolina. This venture combines our sales, marketing, distribution, compounding and manufacturing expertise with the PPS polymer technology expertise of Kureha America Inc.
Cellulose derivatives strategic ventures. Our cellulose derivatives ventures within our Consumer Specialties segment generally fund their operations using operating cash flow and pay dividends based on each ventures' performance in the preceding year. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we received cash dividends of $107 million, $107 million and $106 million, respectively.
Although our ownership interest in each of our cellulose derivatives ventures exceeds 20%, we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting because we determined that we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to local government investment in and influence over these entities, limitations on our involvement in the day-to-day operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP").

Research and Development
Our business models leverage innovation and conduct research and development activities to develop new, and optimize existing, production technologies, as well as to develop commercially viable new products and applications. Research and development expense was $72 million, $78 million and $119 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We consider the amounts spent during each of the last three fiscal years on research and development activities to be sufficient to execute our current strategic initiatives.

Patents. In most industrial countries, patent protection exists for new substances and formulations, as well as for certain unique applications and production processes. However, we do business in regions of the world where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce.
Confidential Information. We maintain stringent information security policies and procedures wherever we do business. Such information security policies and procedures include data encryption, controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information and trade secrets, as well as employee awareness training.

Backlog
We do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of net sales or financial performance.
