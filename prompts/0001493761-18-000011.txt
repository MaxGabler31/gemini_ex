Item 1 - Business Overview
Turtle Beach Corporation, headquartered in San Diego, California is the global leader in gaming headsets and has been an innovator in premier audio technology for over 40 years. The Turtle Beach® brand is highly regarded among the over 700 million gamers in North America and Europe where the company has a dominant market share in gaming headsets for Xbox and PlayStation® consoles. In addition to its gaming headset business, the company acquired and developed an innovative and patent-protected sound technology that delivers immersive, directional audio called HyperSound® via a reverse merger with Parametric Technologies in January 2014. 
Turtle Beach Corporation was incorporated in the state of Nevada in 2010 and the company’s stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol HEAR. 
VTB Holdings, Inc. (“VTBH”), the subsidiary of Turtle Beach and the parent holding company of Voyetra Turtle Beach, Inc. (“VTB”) and Turtle Beach Europe Limited (“TB Europe”), together the historical headset business, was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2010 with operations principally located in Valhalla, New York. VTB was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1975. 
Headset Business
Turtle Beach launched its first gaming headset in 2005 and has grown to be the leading brand in console gaming headsets. The Company designs and markets premium audio peripherals for both Xbox and PlayStation® game consoles, as well as for PC, Mac® and mobile/tablet devices. Additionally, Turtle Beach is an officially-licensed partner of Microsoft, delivering innovative and groundbreaking first-to-market products for their latest family of consoles including the latest Xbox One X. Turtle Beach headsets are distributed internationally across North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Asia, and are sold at thousands of storefronts, including major retailers such as Amazon, Argos, Best Buy, Game, GameStop, EB Games, Target, and Walmart.
The Company offers a variety of headsets, spanning multiple retail price points ranging from $20 to $300, with offerings compatible across all major gaming platforms. Our price tiers correspond to customer profiles, beginning with “Entry-Level” gamers and progressing through “Casual,” “Enthusiast,” “Core,” and professional gamers including eSports players and fans. Each successive price tier incorporates a higher level of finish, features and technology, progressing from passive mono to amplified stereo, surround sound, and programmable surround sound. Premium headsets have padded leather headbands, accent stitching, and noise-isolating memory foam ear cups. Other features found in select premium headset models include removable microphones, breakaway cables and “charge-and-play” batteries that allow gamers to continue playing even as they recharge their batteries. As gaming consoles have evolved from dedicated video game platforms to home entertainment hubs, and as mobile and tablet devices have become mainstay platforms for entertainment, we have continued to evolve our headsets to reflect how content is consumed.
Each Turtle Beach headset is designed for a “primary” platform, such as a specific console or for the personal computer platform, though many can be used with multiple platforms, and most are compatible with mobile/tablet devices via a standard 3.5mm jack and Bluetooth® connectivity. A primary platform designation paired with our unique, platform-specific packaging designs often result in our products being assorted in multiple sections in-store by retailers, increasing the prominence of the Turtle Beach brand and its products in physical retail locations and online catalogs.
In 2017, Turtle Beach was the leading console gaming headset manufacturer in North America with a 42.1% dollar share of the market, as noted by the December 2017 sales tracking data from The NPD Group, Inc (“NPD Group”), holding six of the top ten selling Xbox One models and four of the top ten selling PlayStation®4 models by revenue. Market share in the UK was 51.8% in 2017 as reported by GFK. The company has achieved these high global market shares by delivering high quality products that often include first-to-market innovations and robust features, in addition to superior sound and unmatched comfort - all key factors gamers look for when shopping for a gaming headset.

HyperSound Business
HyperSound technology is a pioneering audio solution that projects sound in a highly directional manner. HyperSound directs a beam of audio to targeted listeners in a specific spot, delivering an immersive, 3D-like audio experience as well as benefits for people with hearing loss. The Company has also developed and patented the capability to created directed audio from a transparent “speaker” using a set of layered materials on glass. The technology has applications in multiple verticals including retail displays where isolated audio is desired, personal or business audio where a directed beam of audio offers privacy benefits, and living room audio solutions for people with hearing loss. 
Our business model for HyperSound has evolved into a licensing strategy, focusing on out licenses to companies in the retail aspect for more precise marketing. In October 2017, we signed a licensing contract with Waves Systems to incorporate

HyperSound technology for customer contact points such as retail point of sales, kiosks, digital signage, wayfinding, museum exhibits, meeting halls and more.
Industry Overview 
Gaming Headset Market
Gaming headsets are part of a global, growing gaming market sized at over $100 billion. Global gaming now exceeds both global cinema and global music market sizes with over 2.1 billion active gamers worldwide. Gaming peripherals are a $2 billion business globally with over 75%, over $800 million, of that market in the Americas and Europe where the company’s business is focused. Gaming headsets are nearly half of that, at over $1 billion in global market size.
eSports is a global phenomena where professional gamers train, compete, win prize money and attract fans similar to other professional sports. There are over 140 million eSports enthusiasts globally and growing quickly. Gaming headsets are a must-have piece of equipment for competitive gaming. 
Xbox and PlayStation® consoles are the dominant gaming platforms in North America and Europe. Many gamers play online where gaming headsets - which include a microphone and allow players to communicate with one another in real time - provide the ability to jump in and engage in the industry’s most popular games and franchises. Gaming headsets also create a more immersive and rich gaming experience. In addition to consoles, personal computers are a key platform for gaming and utilize similar style headsets with the requisite benefits. Gaming on mobile/tablet devices represents about a third of the global gaming market and headsets can be used for mobile gaming, but Xbox, PlayStation®, and PC gaming are by far the largest drivers of gaming headset use. Nintendo Switch™ has emerged as a popular gaming platform, although much less of a driver of gaming headset sales. 
Historically, Microsoft and Sony go through cycles where their respective console platform is changed and/or updated to a significant new version. In holiday 2013, Microsoft launched Xbox One to replace Xbox 360, while Sony launched Playstation®4 to replace Playstation®3. Those console transitions created a major disruption for gaming headsets and other accessories because the fundamental connectivity to the new platforms changed. From 2013 to 2015, that disruption negatively impacted the gaming accessory market as the old generation headset business rapidly declined and new headsets had to be developed for the new consoles. In 2016 and 2017, respectively, both Microsoft and Sony launched “Pro” versions of their latest console platforms which didn’t create any disruption for the gaming headset business and the Company believes this is a good indication that any potential future console changes will not be as disruptive.
In addition to console sales, the Xbox, PlayStation®, and PC gaming markets are driven by major games which encourage players to buy equipment and accessories. On Xbox and PlayStation®, tentpole games like Call of Duty®, Destiny, Battlefront, Grand Theft Auto and more recently Fortnite and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds are examples of major franchises that feature online multiplayer modes, which drive gaming headset sales. Many of these established franchises launch new titles annually leading into the holidays, which furthers the popularity of gaming headsets as gift items. As a result, the gaming headset business is highly seasonal, often with 45%-55% of the business occurring in the fourth quarter. The gaming headset business can also expand or contract based on the success of these major game launches. 
During 2017, PlayerUnkown’s Battlegrounds introduced a new style of multiplayer game known as “Battle Royal,” where players compete in a large, but shrinking maps until there is a single winner left. Players can play on teams, and audio cues are very helpful to surviving, making headsets a key accessory for this type of game. Epic Games introduced Fortnite which includes a similar format in late 2017, but with a more kid-friendly feel. Both games have soared in popularity over the past months with large and continually growing audiences of both players and spectators via content sharing platforms like Twitch, YouTube, Xbox’s Mixer, and PlayStation® Now. 
Gaming headsets are sold through major retailers such as Argos, Best Buy, GameStop, Target and Walmart as well as online retailers such as Amazon and NewEgg. Brick and mortar retailers often have “kiosks” which enable shoppers to “try before they buy,” offering consumers the opportunity to experience each headset’s specific fit, feel and overall audio quality. 
Over the past few years, retail channel inventory levels have varied significantly. At the end of 2016, channel inventories were much higher than normal in North America and Europe due to weaker than expected performance of the major holiday game releases. This impacted revenues for the Company in the first half of 2017 given lower than normal retail replenishment. Additionally, retailers steadily reduced their run-rate inventory levels as part of increasing their competitiveness with online retailers. And in late 2017 many retailers were extremely conservative in their ordering which resulted in sporadic stock-outs at least for Turtle Beach given robust holiday demand. Coming into 2018, demand for gaming headsets has been very strong in North America and Europe resulting in the retailers needing to rapidly replenish. Currently, retail inventory levels are at a low but sustainable level and the Company expects sales in the near term to more closely reflect sell through.

Business Strategy
We intend to further build upon Turtle Beach's brand awareness, superior audio technology and high-quality products to grow the core console business as well as enter the personal computer casual gaming business to increase sales and profitability.

• | Continue to Advance Our Brand. We believe that our brand's image among consumers is a competitive advantage and that our success is attributable to our emphasis on delivering the highest quality, most innovative headsets. 

To maintain our competitive position in our markets, we are focused on the following:

• | continuing to deliver innovative, high quality gaming headsets that incorporate advanced audio and wireless technology; while delivering a superior game and chat audio experience and unmatched comfort.


• | maintaining our strategic relationships and furthering investment in social media and eSports partnerships, which we believe provide our brand a larger presence with consumers and create opportunities for retailers to carry our products;


• | leveraging high-quality technical support/customer service to exceed consumer expectations and develop brand loyalty.


• | Expand Our Product Lines. We continue to invest in the resources necessary to maintain and expand our technical capability to manufacture multiple product lines that incorporate the latest technologies. In 2017, we launched an industry-first Xbox One headset that wirelessly connects directly to the console. 


• | Grow Revenue in New Channels. We intend to increase our sales by continuing to develop internally, or through potential acquisitions, products that we offer to our customers with an enhanced focus on growth in the personal computer gaming sector. In order to meet emerging consumer habits, we will continue to invest in and remodel our website to drive direct sales expansion. 

Product Development 
We continue to innovate, make improvements to our technology and develop new products, and anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in the near future. Our product management team takes a disciplined approach to product design that balances iteration, incremental improvement and innovation to achieve a blend of differentiated technology designed to attract customers, maintain product design continuity and exceed expectations as to quality, reliability and profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we invested $5.6 million in the continued expansion of our new generation headset portfolio including the launch of the Recon Chat, and the Stealth 600 and Stealth 700 series. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we expended $8.3 million and $11.6 million, respectively, reflective of certain HyperSound investments.
Intellectual Property
We operate in industries where innovations, investment in new ideas and protection of resulting intellectual property rights are critical to success. We have a substantial base of intellectual property assets to protect our current and future product development, such as key innovations in gaming headsets as well as all of the core technology areas behind HyperSound, and intend to vigorously enforce such rights.
As a third-party gaming headset company certain technology used in the new generation of consoles, such as integrated voice and chat audio from the Xbox One, requires a license to enable products to connect to that platform. While Playstation®4 does not require any license to produce headsets that can connect, certain connections on the Xbox One require the purchase of proprietary chips to integrate into the locked chat audio.
While we currently believe that we have the necessary licenses, or can obtain the necessary licenses to produce compatible products, there is no guarantee that licenses will be renewed or granted. Moreover, if these licensing parties enter into exclusive license agreements with companies other than us for their “closed systems” or if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these headset adapters or chips, we would be placed at a competitive disadvantage.
Supply Chain and Operations
We have a global network of suppliers that manufacture products to meet our cost objectives and quality standards sought by our customers. We have worked closely with component, manufacturing and global logistic partners to build a supply chain that we consider predictable, scalable and consistent to provide high-quality, reliable products and leading cost management 
5

practices. The use of outsourced manufacturing facilities is designed to take advantage of specific expertise and allow for flexibility and scalability to respond to seasonality and changing demands for our products.
In anticipation of new product development and incremental growth, we made additional investments with a focus on making advancements to our planning systems. In connection with our initiative to improve our operating efficiency and reduce costs, we have continued efforts to focus on company-wide overhead reduction activities including right-sizing our supply chain, consolidation of warehouses with our global logistics partnership with Keuhne & Nagel and transitioned our European warehouse to a third-party logistics provider.
We believe we have solid relationships with our suppliers and that, subject to the discussion in “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,” we will continue to have a sufficient supply of quality products on satisfactory terms.
Retail Distribution
Our headsets are sold in over 40 countries, by retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy, Game, GameStop, EB Games, Target, and Walmart. We often have a broader assortment and more shelf space than competitors at video game and electronics retailers such as GameStop and Best Buy, which we believe reinforces the brand’s authenticity with gaming enthusiasts, and our presence in mass channel retailers such as Walmart and Target enables the brand to reach a wider audience of casual gamers. Our established presence on Amazon.com and other online retail sites, and positive consumer product ratings on those sites, increases the search visibility of our products and helps to influence both online and in-store sales.
Turtle Beach Europe serves as a primary sales office for the European market, and has strengthened our international operations with support for sales, marketing, customer service and distribution.
TurtleBeach.com is an important focal point for our marketing efforts serving as a destination for paid and earned media. Earned media is favorable publicity gained through promotional efforts other than advertising, as compared with paid media, which refers to publicity gained through advertising. The website acts as a hub for both online and offline activity, and provides a direct sales channel for new and refurbished products.

Geographic Information
In addition to the traditional markets of the United States and United Kingdom, we have pursued growth in countries such as Germany and France and believe that additional long-term growth opportunities exist in Asia Pacific and Latin America. 
During 2016, we began to improve our international structure by taking retailers across Europe direct, leveraging off our new warehousing facility and simplifying our distribution model to provide less risk and lower infrastructure costs. In 2017, the Company gained market share in most of our major European markets, particularly in the United Kingdom.

Seasonality
Our gaming headset business is seasonal with a significant portion of sales and profits typically occurring around the holiday period. Historically, more than 45% of headset business revenues are generated during the period from September through December as new headsets are introduced and consumers engage in holiday shopping. In addition, launches of major new online multiplayer games and specific retailer purchasing behavior can drive significant revenue shifts between months and quarters in a given year.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, Turtle Beach had 135 employees, of which 116 were full-time salaried employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
