  Item 1. Business: 
         International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 90 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues todaythe company creates value for clients through integrated solutions and products that leverage data, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. IBM solutions typically create value by enabling new capabilities for clients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of consulting and IT implementation services, cloud and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software; all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations. 
 Strategy 
         The IBM strategy starts with its clients. 
         As a uniquely integrated technology and services company, IBM helps clients change the way the world works by building smarter businesses. 
         IBM's clients include many of the world's most successful enterprises. These clients are at an inflection point, facing tremendous new opportunity and incredible competition. Digital technologies are unlocking unparalleled insight from previously inaccessible data. Work processes are being reimagined for speed and vastly smarter decision-making. 
         To win in these disruptive times requires that businesses learnlearn by extracting insights from their data and by applying those insights to how work is done. Smarter businesses do this faster and more effectively supported by IBM's combination of Innovative Technology, Industry Expertise and Trust and Security. 
         The company's capabilities include: 
   Cloud 
         Cloud is enabling the emergence of platforms through standardization, agility and innovation in both IT and business processes. Enterprise cloud is very different from consumer cloud: enterprises must bridge together mission-critical assets from on-premise systems with private cloud and public cloud. Hybrid cloud technology provides that bridge. All three must coexist and interoperate as a single platform. 
         The IBM Cloud is uniquely:
 

 Built for all applications: Applications require data. That data is in on-premise systems, in private clouds and in the public cloud. The IBM
Cloud enables one data platform that, regardless of data's location, can run all applications. IBM's hybrid cloud capabilities make this single platform operate seamlessly. 
 Artificial intelligence (AI)-ready: The IBM Cloud is built from the ground up to handle the demanding data and computational requirements
of AI.
 Secure to the Core: IBM has a long history of helping clients keep data and transactions secure. Security is even more important in an
increasingly connected world, and IBM has extended this unparalleled level of security to the cloud. For example, IBM's cybersecurity offerings act as a business immune system, with AI technology at
its core, delivered from the IBM Cloud. These 

 1

  

systems
help to defend and respond to cyber-attacks across an organization's data, applications, mobile and endpoint devices. 


         The IBM Cloud is delivered with leading edge technology, including:
 

 Modern infrastructure: IBM's systems, including servers, storage and operating system software, have been refreshed and redesigned for cloud
and enterprise AI workloads. IBM's new z14 is the world's first system to offer pervasive encryption of data without requiring changes to applications, and with no performance degradation. With IBM's
systems, clients can build an IT infrastructure that is optimized for the scalability, reliability and growth that businesses need in today's data-driven
world.
 Future infrastructure: The Q Network on the IBM Cloud enables clients around the world to explore quantum computing capabilities. IBM is the
leader in quantum computing. Clients are signing on to explore how to overcome foreseen constraints in traditional computing models. 

   AI and Data 
         Artificial intelligence can help clients extract insight and make intelligent decisions from data. Like cloud, enterprise AI is very different from consumer AI. Enterprise applications deal with more complex use cases that benefit from expert knowledge, such as in healthcare or in the identification of business risk. Enterprise AI applications are trained by expert data, through data sets of all sizes and with more specialization than those in the general-knowledge consumer world. IBM AIthrough the Watson platform:
 

 Learns more from less data: The ability to extract deep insights from both large and small data sets is essential for enterprise applications.
Watson excels at this and can produce more insights with less data than other AI systems. That means clients can get started more quickly and begin to gain experience deploying AI in the enterprise. 
 Protects clients' insights: While Watson builds on cumulative experience and knowledge, IBM recognizes that data and insights are clients' most
important assets and a true competitive advantage. Watson is built to safeguard this type of information.
 Reimagines your workflows: Watson has been built forand trained inareas requiring deep expertise. Watson brings AI to
professionals so that work can be done more efficiently, and even more importantly, can improve as the systems learn from the data. 

 Solutions 
         Creating smarter businesses requires reimagining a company's core processesfor example, in healthcare, managing risk or optimizing a supply chain. In addition to building solutions based on IBM's experience, IBM is also creating a series of AI solutionscognitive solutionsthat embed artificial intelligence and data to change how work is done. Examples include:


 Global Industry Platforms: provides cognitive, analytics, security and cloud technology in comprehensive industry-specific platforms to remove
much of the cost and complexity of delivering core business functions. For example: Banking, wealth management, and insurance are some of the areas poised for dramatic change by using cognitive and AI
solutions from IBM Watson Financial Services. Watson Health provides technology and expertise to empower leaders, advocates and influencers in health to accelerate discovery, make essential
connections and gain confidence on their path to solving the world's biggest health challenges. 
 Blockchain Solutions: IBM is working with clients and developers across multiple industries to use blockchain to transform how business is done
in areas such as banking and financial services and supply chain. For example, blockchain technology can be used to digitize global trade 

 2

  

processes,
providing a more efficient and secure method of moving goods across borders and trading zones.


 Watson IoT: includes both a cloud-based platform and industry solutions infused with AI, helping organizations mine intelligence from billions
of connected devices. 

 Enterprise Services 
         Through Global Business Services and Global Technology Services, IBM has helped the world's most successful enterprises transition from era to era. Using proven methods, IBM Services bring globally delivered outcomes using proven methods by focusing on:


 Digital Reinvention for growth: a unique framework for business transformation focused on growth opportunities. 
 End-to-end Services integration: Global Technology Services brings the ability to connect previously disconnected parts of an organization. By
embedding Watson into these mission critical services, new levels of quality, resiliency and automation are achieved.
 Pragmatic journey to Cloud and AI: Global Business Services brings its deep experience when guiding clients through the journey to cloud and
AI. Clients gain from the thorough understanding of technology and the best ways to utilize it. 

         As clients reinvent their businesses to be smarter, they need all of this to work together. This is what they expect from IBM, what they need from IBM and what sets IBM apart. 
 *                *                *         * 
         Responsible stewardship is an enduring principle that underscores all IBM endeavors. While IBM is constantly ushering in new technology it does so by:
 

 Leading in data responsibility, ethics and transparency; 
 Preparing workforces of the world; 
 Continuing the company's century-long commitment to diversity and inclusion, and
 Remaining grounded in a set of enduring IBM Values: 


 Dedication to every client's success 
 Innovation that mattersfor our company and for the world 
 Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships 


         IBM has built a reputation and track record of trust with its clients for more than a century. IBM safeguards a client's privacy, data and insights. For example, IBM was one of the first companies to appoint a Chief Privacy Officer, to develop and publish a genetics privacy policy, to be certified under the APEC Cross Borders Privacy Rules system and to sign the EU Data Protection Code of Conduct for Cloud Service Providers. 
 *                *                *         * 
         This is an era where being faster, more productive and lower cost is important but frankly not enough. To win, a business must be smarter: Being smarter means having deeper expertise, extracting better insights from data and being capable of rapidly changing the way in which one does work. 
         This is core to the strategy of IBM's clients and is at the heart of the IBM strategy. 
   Business Model 
         The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping enterprise clients to move from one era to the next by bringing together innovative technology and industry expertise, and providing long-term value to shareholders.

Internally remarketed equipment revenue primarily represents used equipment that is sold internally to Systems and Technology Services & Cloud Platforms. Systems may also sell the equipment that it purchases from Global Financing to external clients. 
   IBM Worldwide Organizations 
         The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients:
 

 Global Markets
 Research, Development and Intellectual Property 

 Global Markets 
         IBM has a global presence, operating in more than 175 countries with a broad-based geographic distribution of revenue. The company's Global Markets organization manages IBM's global footprint, working closely with dedicated country-based operating units to serve clients locally. These country teams have client relationship managers who lead integrated teams of consultants, solution specialists and delivery professionals to enable clients' growth and innovation. 
         By complementing local expertise with global experience and digital capabilities, IBM builds deep and broad-based client relationships. This local management focus fosters speed in supporting clients, addressing new markets and making investments in emerging opportunities. The Global Markets organization serves clients with expertise in their industry as well as through the products and services that IBM and partners supply. IBM is also expanding its reach to new and existing clients through digital marketplaces, digital sales and local Business Partner resources. 
   Research, Development and Intellectual Property 
         IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually invests 7 to 8 percent of total revenue for R&D, focusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. IBM Research works with clients and the company's business units through global labs on near-term and mid-term innovations. It delivers many new technologies to IBM's portfolio every year and helps clients address their most difficult challenges. IBM Research scientists are conducting pioneering work in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, blockchain, security, cloud, nanotechnology, silicon and post-silicon computing architectures and moreapplying these technologies across industries including healthcare, IoT, education and financial services. 
         In 2017, for the 25th consecutive year, IBM was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company. IBM's 9,043 patents awarded in 2017 represent a diverse range of inventions in artificial intelligence, cloud, cybersecurity and other strategic growth areas for the company. 
         The company continues to actively seek IP protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its IP leadership. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. As part of its business model, the company licenses certain of its intellectual property, which is high-value technology, but may be in more mature markets. The licensee drives the future development of the IP and ultimately expands the customer base. This would generate IP income for the company both upon licensing, and with any ongoing royalty arrangements between it and the licensee. While the company's various proprietary IP rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products.
