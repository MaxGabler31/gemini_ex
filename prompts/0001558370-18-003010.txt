 Item 1.  Business.
 Overview
 Global Power Equipment Group Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“Global Power,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” unless the context indicates otherwise) are comprehensive providers of custom solutions and maintenance and modification services for customers in the energy and industrial markets. Including our predecessor entities, we have over 50 years of experience providing services that are critical for the operation of power plants and more than 32 years of experience providing complex outage shutdown services to operators of nuclear power plants and other industrial maintenance services.
 During the fourth quarter of 2017, we made the decision to exit and sell our Electrical Solutions segment. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2017, we made the decision to exit and sell substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of our Mechanical Solutions segment, which we completed in the fourth quarter of 2017, as described below. These decisions were made in an effort to reduce our outstanding term debt. We determined that these two segments met the definition of discontinued operations, and, as a result, they (including TOG Manufacturing Company, Inc. and TOG Holdings, Inc., which were sold in July 2016) have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments were the only components of the business that qualified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise specified, the financial information and discussion in this Form 10-K are based on our continuing operations (previously our Services segment); they exclude any results of our discontinued operations. Please refer to “Note 4—Changes in Business” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information.
 On October 11, 2017, we sold substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of our Mechanical Solutions segment and used a portion of the $40.9 million net proceeds to pay down $34.0 million of our outstanding debt and related fees, including full repayment of the First-Out Loan (as defined below), and the upfront fee on the Initial Centre Lane Facility (as defined below). Additionally, on October 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our manufacturing facility in Mexico and auctioned the remaining production equipment and other assets for net proceeds of $3.6 million, of which $1.9 million was used to reduce the principal amount of the Initial Centre Lane Facility. The remaining proceeds from such sales were used to fund working capital requirements.
 In January 2017, we sold the stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Hetsco Holdings, Inc. and Hetsco, Inc. (collectively, “Hetsco”), for $23.2 million in cash, inclusive of working capital adjustments. After transaction costs and an escrow withholding of $1.5 million, the net proceeds of $20.2 million were used to reduce debt. Hetsco provided brazed aluminum heat exchanger repair and maintenance and safety services to the industrial gas, liquefied natural gas and petrochemical industries. Following the sale of Hetsco, we no longer engage in these services and no longer maintain intellectual property related to the Hetsco trade name or brand. Unless otherwise specified, information contained in this report is as of December 31, 2017 and reflects the sale of Hetsco.
 Subsequent to December 31, 2017, several contingencies have been positively resolved. We have a well-respected team in our markets and our backlog for our Williams business (as defined below) is strengthening. We also believe several growth initiatives being pursued to enhance Williams’ performance appear promising. Given this momentum and other relevant considerations, the Board of Directors (the “Board” or “Board of Directors”) has concluded it is an opportune time to evaluate strategic alternatives for Global Power, with the goal of advancing the best interests of our shareholders and providing improved long-term opportunities for our customers and employees. We also continue to work diligently to conclude the sale of Electrical Solutions by the end of the second quarter.
 Our Strategy
 As a result of our decision to exit and sell our Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments, our chief operating decision makers review financial information presented on a company-wide basis. Therefore, as of December 31, 2017, we concluded that we have a single reporting segment and operating unit structure, which is comprised of Williams Industrial Services Group, LLC (collectively with Williams Plant Services, LLC, Williams Specialty Services, LLC and Williams Industrial Services, LLC, the “Williams business”). 
 Our strategy over the last few years has been to improve operations, focus on our core competencies, sell non-core assets, aggressively manage working capital and reduce costs in order to improve liquidity and reduce debt. As a result, we have transformed the organization into a services business that provides a broad range of general and specialty construction, maintenance and modification, and plant management support services to our clients in the nuclear, hydro and fossil power

generation, pulp and paper, refining, petrochemical, government, manufacturing and other industries. We expect to leverage the strength of the Williams brand, capitalize on our industry knowledge and customer relationships and safely provide timely, reliable services for our customers to grow revenue. We have major cost reduction initiatives planned to reduce our overhead costs as we restructure and consolidate our corporate functions. We expect this to increase our operating leverage and expand margins as we pursue new revenue opportunities. Our operations are based on our effectiveness in using estimating and engineering technologies, deploying rigorous project management techniques, initiating various process improvement projects and employing experienced industry-recognized sales professionals.
 We are currently experiencing strained liquidity and a lack of financing options, and we are currently evaluating further strategic alternatives to address these challenges and meet the requirements of our current lenders. These strategic alternatives could include, but are not limited to, the potential sale of Global Power, including our Williams business. 
 Our Business
 We provide a comprehensive range of maintenance, modification and construction support services for nuclear power plants and a wide range of utility and industrial customers in the fossil fuel, industrial gas, natural gas and petrochemical industries, as well as other industrial operations. We provide these services both on a constant presence basis and for discrete projects. The services we provide are designed to improve or sustain operating efficiencies and extend the useful lives of process equipment. 
 Our services include the following:

· | Nuclear Power Plant Maintenance, Modification and Construction. We perform a full range of critical services for the nuclear facility market, including capital projects and facility upgrades, as well as routine maintenance and modification work. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other Industrial and Power Generation Maintenance, Modification and Construction We provide routine maintenance, repair and capital project services designed to extend life cycles for other industrial and power generation facilities, including paper, fossil fuel, industrial gas, hydro power and natural gas. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Water and Wastewater Modifications and Construction. We provide repair, modifications, maintenance and new build services for municipal water and wastewater facilities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Industrial Painting and Coatings. We perform cleaning, surface preparation, coatings application, quality control and inspection testing on major coating projects for nuclear and fossil fuel power plants, industrial facilities and petrochemical plants. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Insulation. We provide a variety of industrial insulation services, primarily in power generation installations. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Asbestos and Lead Abatement. We provide abatement services for the removal of asbestos and heavy metal based coatings such as lead paint. We do not take ownership of hazardous materials and do not assume responsibility for the liability associated with the materials other than for our actions meeting applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Roofing Systems. We replace, repair and upgrade industrial facility roofing systems, primarily at pulp and paper manufacturing facilities and nuclear power plant locations. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Oil and Gas Modifications and Construction. We have executed select oil and gas projects for many years, but we have recently hired personnel with specific oil and gas experience to aggressively pursue that market full-time. We are targeting several customers and specific projects and are planning to establish offices in key Gulf Coast cities. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Analog to Digital Conversions. Conversion of analog control systems to digital controls improves reliability and accuracy to plant systems, and often allows plants to run at higher levels. As a result, it is a capital improvement that utilities and industries are investing in at several operating plants. We successfully completed several digital upgrades on multiple units for two of our customers, and we are targeting several more. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Canada Nuclear. Two power companies in Canada have announced their intention to extend the lives of several of their operating nuclear units and established large capital improvement budgets to that end. We believe that the work required for such improvements is similar to upgrades completed for nuclear plants in the United States (“U.S.”). Therefore, we commenced a strategic initiative to pursue new maintenance, modification and construction opportunities in Canada. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Nuclear Decommissioning. Several U.S. nuclear stations have already been shut down, and several more shutdowns are planned. After shutdown, the plants must be decommissioned. This process takes many years. We are working with a supplier on one of the sites being decommissioned and are targeting the decommissioning market as it grows. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We provide these services throughout the U.S., primarily on a direct hire basis, with experienced craft laborers who are directed and managed by an experienced team of supervisors and project managers across our network. We also act in a general contracting capacity where we manage multiple subcontractors and, in other cases, we are retained as a subcontractor on a project. Our flexible staffing model enables us to meet seasonal and outage demand without being restricted by internal capacity limitations, thereby minimizing our fixed costs.
 In 2017, we contracted for 76% of our revenue on cost-plus contracts that provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit. The remaining 24% of our revenue was generated from fixed-price contracts.
 We bid against other contractors based on customer specifications. Fixed-price contracts present certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Alternatively, because of efficiencies that may be realized during the contract term, fixed-price contracts may offer greater profit potential than cost-plus contracts.
 Market Overview
 Power Generation Market and the Industrial Services Industry.  The U.S. industrial services industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, broadly defined as routine modification, maintenance and technical services provided to industrial facilities ranging from manufacturing facilities to power generation plants. The industry continues to benefit from a shift towards outsourcing as plant operators seek to alleviate financial constraints, reduce labor costs, increase labor utilization and productivity, and eliminate operational redundancies.
 We expect that power industry demand for these services will be driven by the following factors in the future:

· | Aging Power Generation Infrastructure Increases Demand for Plant Maintenance and Decommissioning Services. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”), more than half of the electrical generating capacity in the U.S. was placed in service before 1990. Coupled with the relatively limited number of large-scale power generation facilities being constructed in the U.S., the efforts to maintain older plants of all types and to take advantage of newer and more efficient technologies at existing sites result in opportunities for companies providing services to plant operators. The low price of natural gas is driving demand for new, upgraded and replacement electric generation capacity toward combined cycle gas powered plants, which are more economical to run. With natural gas pricing expected to remain low, this is also driving the conversions of simple cycle plants to combined cycle technology. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Further, approximately 90 nuclear reactors that have been in operation in the U.S. for more than 30 years require extensive ongoing engineering and maintenance services to support operations and improve performance. Nuclear power plants in the U.S. are subject to a rigorous program of U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) oversight, inspection, preventive and corrective maintenance, equipment replacement and equipment testing. Nuclear power plants are required to go offline to refuel at intervals of no more than 24 months and to perform condition monitoring and preventive maintenance during every refueling outage. Initially, commercial nuclear power plants in the U.S. were licensed to operate for 40 years, reflecting the amortization period generally used by electric utility companies for large capital investments. As of December 31, 2016, the NRC had extended the licenses of approximately 85 reactors. In all, about 90 reactors are expected to operate for up to 60 years, with owners undertaking an increase in modification, maintenance and construction capital projects to upgrade their facilities. Decommissioning work on retired nuclear reactors also provides future opportunities for growth.

· | North America Infrastructure Growth. Record levels of natural gas production have driven the development of transmission and distribution infrastructure to reduce transportation bottlenecks and bring more natural gas to key markets. The value proposition of low cost shale gas is transitioning from upstream to downstream users, including petrochemical facilities and power generation assets. Infrastructure growth provides opportunities for us to assist in the construction and maintenance of these facilities. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Nuclear Power Plant Services and New Nuclear Reactor Construction. We are one of a limited number of companies qualified to perform comprehensive services in U.S. nuclear power plants under rules issued by the NRC. We are one of the few contractors with a qualified and audited Nuclear Quality Assurance (“NQA-1”) Program, which is required to perform contract services at the new build reactors. Under these rules, owners of nuclear facilities must qualify contractors by requiring the contractors to demonstrate that they will comply with NRC regulations on quality assurance, reporting of safety issues, security and control of personnel access and conduct. On the majority of our maintenance and project work, we directly hire the labor and provide the management and supervision to perform the work directly for the owner. In some cases, we act as a general contractor and subcontract portions of the work or, alternatively, subcontract our services to full scope engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) firms or general contractor firms. We maintain good relationships with the utilities, the EPC firms, the general contractor firms and relevant engineering firms. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Standby and Distributed Power Generation. Unlike central station generation, standby and distributed power generation equipment can sit on either side of the utility meter and may be owned by a utility, a customer or a third party. Peak energy demand requirements and higher costs, as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure limits, are driving investment into this space. The growth in industries with high power demand and sensitivity to power supply instability, such as datacenters, medical centers, universities and remotely located industrial loads, are straining the traditional power infrastructure. The electric power needs for these markets have been served by small-scale utility-owned diesel or gas engine generators strategically located to support distributed system operations. The power supply is trending toward larger (greater than 1,000 kilowatts) diesel engine generator systems and expanding into alternative energy assets.

  Customers, Marketing and Seasonality
 Our customers include major private and government-owned utilities throughout the U.S., as well as leaders in the U.S. pulp and paper and industrial sectors. We market our services using dedicated sales and marketing personnel as well as our experienced on-site operations personnel. We use our safety and service track record with long-term renewable contracts to expand our services and supplement existing contracts with small- to medium-sized capital projects. Our sales initiatives directly seek to apply operational strengths to specific facilities within our targeted industries and customers throughout the U.S. We are materially impacted by seasonality, resulting in fluctuations in revenue and gross profit during our fiscal year. Generally, this is driven by our customers’ schedule of planned outages.
 We depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of any of those customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. For a listing of our major customers, please refer to “Note 15—Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
 Quality Capabilities and Safety Performance
 Through our NQA-1 Program and other programs, we provide training, certifications and ongoing safety monitoring to all of our employees working at nuclear sites. We are one of a limited number of companies qualified to work anywhere in a U.S. nuclear facility and have been one of the leading providers of coatings at U.S. nuclear facilities for almost 40 years. In addition, we are one of only a few contractors with the qualified and audited NQA-1 Program that is required to perform contract services at new build reactors. For over 13 years, we have maintained a safety record in the top quartile of the industry, benefiting both us and our customers. We also maintain a broad range of professional certifications and memberships in national organizations relevant to the performance of many of the specialized services we provide. Materials and Suppliers
 The markets for most of the materials we use are served by a large number of suppliers, and we believe that we can obtain required materials from more than one supplier.

 Competition
 Our competitors vary depending on plant geography and the scope of services to be rendered. Several national service providers, which are significantly larger and have significantly greater financial resources than we do, will often compete for larger maintenance and capital project opportunities that become available. These service providers include, among others, Day & Zimmermann and Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. Additionally, smaller contractors that operate on a regional basis often compete for smaller opportunities associated with open shop labor sources. We compete based on reputation, safety, price, service, quality and our breadth of service capabilities. We believe our strong reputation, longevity in the industry, project management capabilities, including service diversity, long-term customer relationships, safety record and performance, and our success at identifying and retaining qualified personnel differentiate us from our competitors. We also believe that the fact that we maintain a presence at several of our customers’ sites is a competitive advantage because it provides us with an intimate understanding of these facilities, which allows us to better identify our customers’ service needs. Specific to our customers that operate nuclear power plants, barriers to entry include the requirement to hold and maintain the rigorous NRC qualifications and safety standards. Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 366 full- and part-time employees (excluding temporary staff and craft labor). The number of our employees fluctuates greatly, depending on the timing and requirements for craft labor. Many of the craft labor employees are employed through various union agreements. As of December 31, 2017, there were 1,109 craft labor employees, of which 864 were under collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2017, our discontinued operations had 33 employees who were covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relationships with our employees, both full-time and temporary, are satisfactory. We are not aware of any circumstances related to our employees that are likely to result in a work stoppage at any of the project sites where we are performing services. In 2017, we sold our Hetsco business and substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of our Mechanical Solutions segment, which resulted in a decrease in the number of our full and part-time employees.  Insurance
 We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations; however, we remain exposed to potential losses because we are subject to deductibles, coverage limits and self-insured retentions.
 Typically, our contracts require us to indemnify our customers for third party injury, damage or loss arising from the performance of our services and provide for warranties for materials and workmanship. We may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured up to the limits of insurance available, or we may be required to purchase special insurance policies for specific customers or provide letters of credit in lieu of bonds to satisfy performance and financial guarantees on some projects.
 We maintain performance and payment bonding lines to support our business. Until June 2017, we maintained a revolving credit facility (as amended from time to time, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) that provided letters of credit. In June 2017, funds associated with Centre Lane Partners, LLC (“Centre Lane”) assumed the Revolving Credit Facility prior to the completion of a new, multi-year term debt agreement entered into by the Company and Centre Lane (the “Initial Centre Lane Facility” and, as otherwise amended from time to time, the “Centre Lane Facility”), which replaced the Revolving Credit Facility; however, the Centre Lane Facility does not provide for letters of credit, and, therefore, we are currently unable to obtain new letters of credit. 
 We require certain of our subcontractors to indemnify us and our customers and name us as an additional insured for activities arising out of such subcontractors’ work. We also require certain subcontractors to provide additional insurance policies, including surety bonds in favor of us, to secure such subcontractors’ work or as required by contract. It is possible that our insurance and the additional insurance coverage provided by our subcontractors will not fully protect us against a valid claim or loss under the contracts with our customers. 
 Intellectual Property
 As of December 31, 2017, we used the Williams trade name and its logo and the logo for Global Power. These trade names and logos are the property of Global Power. Product names and company programs appearing throughout this Form 10-K are trademarks of Global Power. This Form 10-K also may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and those brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners. In January 2017, we sold Hetsco, which maintained some of the intellectual property assets described.

 Compliance with Government Regulations
 We are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental, occupational health and nuclear regulatory laws applicable in the U.S. We also purchase materials and equipment from third parties and engage subcontractors who are also subject to these laws and regulations. Below is a summary of certain laws and regulations applicable to our business.
· | Environmental. We are subject to extensive and changing environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. These laws and regulations relate primarily to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous materials. We are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or hazardous materials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Health and Safety Regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state laws. Regulations promulgated by these agencies require employers and independent contractors who perform construction services, including electrical and repair and maintenance, to implement work practices, medical surveillance systems and personnel protection programs to protect employees from workplace hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals and materials. In recognition of the potential for accidents within various scopes of work, these agencies have enacted very strict and comprehensive safety regulations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NRC. Owners of nuclear power plants are licensed to build, operate and maintain those plants by the NRC. Their license requires that they qualify their suppliers and contractors to ensure that the suppliers and contractors comply with NRC regulations. We must demonstrate to our customers that we will comply with NRC regulations related to quality assurance, reporting of safety issues, security and control of personnel access and conduct. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Department of the Treasury. The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  While we believe that we operate safely and prudently and in material compliance with all environmental, occupational health, nuclear regulatory and other applicable laws, there can be no assurance that accidents will not occur or that we will not incur substantial liability in connection with the operation of our business. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures or material adverse effect on earnings or cash flows as a result of complying with these laws.
 Financial Information about Geographic Areas
 For a discussion of our financial information related to geographic areas, please refer to “Note 3—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Backlog
 Our backlog consists of firm orders or blanket authorizations from our customers. Backlog may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period due to the timing of customer commitments.
 The services we provide are typically carried out under construction contracts, long-term maintenance contracts and master service agreements. Backlog related to fixed-price contracts represents the total amount of revenue we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. With respect to multi-year maintenance contracts, we include in backlog the amount of revenue we expect to receive for only one succeeding year, regardless of the remaining life of the contract. Revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of project accelerations, cancellations or delays due to various factors, including, but not limited to, the customer’s budgetary constraints and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue amounts to be realized in different periods and at levels other than those originally projected. Additional work that is not identified under the original contract is added to our backlog when we reach an agreement with the customer as to the scope and pricing of that additional work. Capital project awards are typically defined in terms of scope and pricing at the time of a contractual commitment from the customer. Upon receipt of a customer commitment, we add capital project bookings to our backlog at full contract value, regardless of the time frame

anticipated to complete the project. Maintenance services and capital project bookings are removed from our backlog as work is performed and revenue is recognized, or upon cancellation.
 Backlog is not a measure defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), and our methodology for determining backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by our customers.
 The following table summarizes our backlog:

 | December 31,
(in thousands) | 2017 | | 2016
Backlog | $ | 137,691 | | $ | 138,567

      Backlog as of December 31, 2017 decreased slightly from December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, $85.6 million, or 62.2%, of the total backlog related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
 For additional discussion of our backlog, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors Related to Our Operations.”
 History
 Global Power was incorporated in 2001 under the laws of the State of Delaware and became the successor to GEEG Holdings, LLC, which was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1998. We and all of our U.S. subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on September 28, 2006 and successfully emerged from bankruptcy pursuant to an approved Plan of Reorganization on January 22, 2008. Upon emergence, we issued 5,266,885 shares of our new common stock to pre-petition equity holders in exchange for stock held before the bankruptcy. On that same date, pursuant to a rights offering, a private placement and related backstop and our Management Incentive Co-Investment Plan, we issued an additional 9,589,138 shares of our new common stock in exchange for $72.5 million in net proceeds. The applicable price of our common stock in the rights offering was $7.65 per share. As part of the plan, we also entered into a $150.0 million credit facility, which was terminated in 2012 in connection with our entry into the Revolving Credit Facility. In June 2011, we received a court order for final decree closing the Chapter 11 Filing. Available Information
