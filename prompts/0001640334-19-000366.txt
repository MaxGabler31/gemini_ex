Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Union Bridge Holdings Limited (the “Company” or “we”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 6, 2014 under the name Costo, Inc. to engage in the business of distributing automobile parts and components necessary for the maintenance and repair of automobiles and specialty equipment, including construction and road machinery, principally in China, Europe and certain Commonwealth of Independent States countries (Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan). We changed our name to Union Bridge Holdings Limited on May 23, 2016 in connection with our expanded business plan under which we determined to expand operations into the health care industry. We never achieved any revenues from our automobile and specialty equipment business and during the fourth quarter of 2017 we determined to discontinue that area of business.
 
The Company incorporated a new wholly owned subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands, First Channel Limited (“FC”), on March 18, 2016. This subsidiary was formed for investment holding.
 
The Company incorporated two new wholly owned subsidiaries in the British Virgin Islands: 1.) Phoenix Creation Global Limited (“PC”) on October 26, 2017 and 2.) Windsor Honour Limited (“WH”) on October 30, 2017, respectively. These subsidiaries were formed with the intent to sell healthcare products and services to seniors and individual with disabilities. The Company recently procured samples of motorized wheelchairs, as the first product in an expected of a portfolio of products targeted at this market.
 
On February 2, 2018, the Company’s subsidiary Union Beam Investment Limited (“UB”) established Qianhai Lianqiao Investment Consulting (Shenzhen) Company Limited, renamed as Union Beam Trading (Shenzhen) Limited (“UB Trading”), a wholly foreign owned entity in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) engaging the sales of healthcare products and services.
 
On February 13, 2018, the Company’s subsidiary PC established Union Care Investment Limited (“UC”) in Hong Kong engaging the senior care services.
 
On May 25, 2018, UC established Sino Silver (Qianhai) Holdings Ltd. (“Sino Silver Qianhai”), a wholly owned entity in the PRC engaging the elderly home care services, senior care centers and community services. As of December 31, 2018, UC and Sino Silver Qianhai have not yet commenced business.
 
On September 20, 2018, Sino Silver Qianhai and UB established Sino Sliver (Beijing) Elderly Service Ltd. (“Sino Silver Beijing”) in the PRC to engaging elderly home care services, operate senior care centers and provide community services in the Beijing region. As of December 31, 2018, Sino Silver Beijing has not yet commenced business.
 
On December 27, 2018, the Company’s subsidiary UC established Sino Silver (Zhuhai Hengqin) Elderly Service Limited “(Sino Silver Zhuhai”), a wholly owned entity in the PRC engaging the elderly home care services, senior care centers and community services. As of December 31, 2018, Sino Silver Zhuhai has not yet commenced business.
 
Since May 23, 2016 we have taken steps to position our company to operate in two segments of the health care industry: (i) as a distributor in Asia of technologically advanced medical equipment devices and other lifestyle products and services for the elderly, including, but not limited to wheelchairs and telemedic devices, and (ii) as an operator of senior care facilities in Asia, including, but not limited to Hong Kong, China and Thailand.
 
We intend to grow primarily through mergers and acquisitions. Prospective targets are companies in the biotech industry, healthcare hospitality and service providers and manufacturers and suppliers of innovative healthcare products and devices, including health supplements. Our intended expansion will require us to raise additional working capital. We do not have any present commitments from any potential providers of funds.

The medical device industry in Asia offers distributors many opportunities. While many sectors are affected by economic downturns, the growth of medical technology remains largely undeterred due to its indispensable nature within an aging population. We intend to compete in this market based upon product quality and cost effectiveness. Competitive product pricing combined with an evolving product line is expected to provide us with the opportunity to efficiently operate in designated territories. We will need to engage local sales distribution channels in connection with our medical products and devices. Our present management does not have experience in the sale of such products and devices.
 
The core elements of our senior health care facility strategy are to:
 

· | Acquire, develop, lease, own and/or manage a diversified portfolio of quality, high level, healthcare properties across multiple geographic locations, initially in Hong Kong, China and Thailand; Align ourselves with leading healthcare companies, operators and service providers, which, over the long term, should result in higher net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Establish name recognition in the geographic areas in which we operate. 

 
We intend to operate in the most attractive sectors of the senior living industry in Asia. Our goal is to be a first choice in senior living by being a most trusted and effective senior living provider. Our senior housing facilities are intended to provide personalized care tailored to fit individual preferences and needs while treating residents with dignity and encouraging independence. Our community and service offerings are intended to combine housing, health care, hospitality and ancillary services. Our senior living communities will offer residents a supportive home-like setting, assistance with activities of daily living and, in certain communities, licensed skilled nursing services. By providing residents with a range of service options as their needs change, we expect to provide greater continuity of care, enabling seniors to “age-in-place”, which we believe enables them to maintain residency with us for longer periods of time. The ability of residents to age-in-place is also beneficial to our residents and their families who are concerned with care decisions for their elderly relatives. With our planned platform of a range of community and service offerings, we believe that we will be positioned to take advantage of favorable demographic trends over time.
 
We also intend to offer in-home services for the elderly, including housing care, meal preparation, feeding, bathing and dressing services. In addition, we intend to establish community centers at which home-based seniors can receive medical support and rehabilitation training. Our present management does not have experience in the operation of senior care facilities. In connection with this segment, we intend to partner with experienced operators of senior care facilities.
 
Our proposed healthcare business is at an early stage of development. No assurances can be given that we will obtain capital as and when needed or that, if obtained, we will successfully develop our healthcare business.
 
Material Commitments
 
On March 23, 2018, our subsidiary, Windsor Honour Limited (“WHL”) entered into a Binding Heads of Agreement with the owner of a land parcel for a senior care facility to be established in Chang Mai, Thailand. The parties will negotiate in good faith toward definitive agreements regarding the project. WHL would lease the land and be the developer of the project and would own the buildings on the site. WHL would have full control of the design and supervision of the construction of the project, as well as daily operations and management of the project. The land owner would be responsible for obtaining necessary construction, operation and other permits for the project and would provide necessary liaison with government officials. Total investment in the project for development and construction is estimated to be approximately 200 million Thai Baht (approximately US$6.4 million at current exchange rates), for which WHL would be responsible to obtain financing. WHL would also be responsible for arranging financing of operating costs until they can be funded from operations. The project would lease the land for 90 years with automatic renewals, each for 30 years. The total rent for the first 90 years would be 10 million Thai Baht (approximately US$320,000 at current exchange rates). In addition to the rent, WHL may consider a discretionary bonus to the land owner (with details to be agreed in the definitive agreements).

No assurance can be given, however, that the Chang Mai, Thailand senior facility project will be successfully developed and operated because, (i) WHL may not successfully negotiate definitive agreements for the project, (ii) required permits may not be obtained, and (iii) required financing may not be obtainable.
 
Through our subsidiary, Phoenix Creation Global Limited ("Phoenix"), on Apr 20, 2018 we entered into a Letter of Intent with Shenyang Shenhe Yixi Home Care Service Center ("Shenyang Yixi") to enter into a joint venture to promote the development of the elderly care business in China. After completing our due diligence and further discussion with Yixi, we have determined not to pursue a transaction with Yixi.
 
Through our subsidiary, Phoenix Creation Global Limited (“Phoenix”), on May 10, 2018 we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Beijing Yi Du Bai Shan Enterprise Management Limited (“Yi Du”) regarding the prospective development and operation of senior healthcare facilities in Beijing, China and the prospective purchase of 85% of the shares of Yi Du. After completing our due diligence and further discussion with Yi Du, we have determined not to pursue a transaction with Yi Du.
 
Through our agent, Union Glory Gold Holdings, on October 3, 2018, we signed a Beijing Elderly Satellites Cooperative Development Proposal (the “Proposal”) with Caroline Holding Group Co., Ltd. of China (“Caroline”) regarding cooperation on opportunities in developing satellite centers that provide home care services and community activities for the elderly and rehabilitation institutions for the elderly in Beijing, China. We subsequently determined not to pursue a transaction with Caroline and are seeking to terminate the agreement with them.
 
On November 6, 2018, our subsidiary, First Channel Limited (“First Channel”), signed a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") with APrevent Medical Inc. ("APrevent") regarding a potential share exchange between UGHL and APrevent. APrevent is a medical device company which designs, manufactures and distributes medical equipment and is currently developing two projects, including Vocal Implant System (VOIS). VOIS is a laryngeal implant used for glottis insufficiency (vocal fold paralysis). Medialization thyroplasty Type I (MT) is the standard treatment for glottis insufficiency, by inserting artificial or transplanted materials into the paraglottic space to achieve glottis closure. In patients with a large glottis gap or high vagal lesions, a surgical procedure, arytenoid adduction (AA), can be performed to reduce the posterior glottis gap and correct the vertical height difference between the vocal folds. Unlike existing products, APrevent’s VOIS implant combines the advantage of both MT and AA for optimized results. The prospective share exchange is subject to the results of each party’s due diligence, agreement on valuation (and therefore number of shares to be exchanged), negotiation of definitive agreements and approval of the board of directors of each party. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the share exchange will be completed.
 
Industry and Market Overview
 
The healthcare industry in Asia is expected to grow by 11.1% in 2018, representing one of the fastest growing regions in the world. This positive growth is fueled by the increasing adoption of technology, innovative healthcare access programs and the delivery of care outside of traditional hospital settings. Frost & Sullivan estimates that the Asian healthcare industry will grow to US$517 billion in 2018.
 
The world’s aging population has received growing attention in recent years bringing the issue of the need for quality elder care options to the forefront. As the elderly population grows at an accelerating rate, many businesses now view elder care as a “sunrise industry” which can offer attractive returns for investors. Today, growth in senior living market presents both tremendous opportunities and challenges.
 
The senior living industry is generally highly fragmented and characterized by numerous local and regional operators. We believe that a number of trends will contribute to the continued growth of the senior living industry in coming years. As a result of scientific and medical breakthroughs over the past 30 years, seniors are living longer. Due to demographic trends, and continuing advances in science, nutrition and healthcare, the senior population will continue to grow, and we expect the demand for senior living services to continue to increase in future years. There is a growing consumer awareness among seniors and their families concerning the types of services provided by senior living operators, which has further contributed to the demand for senior living services

Challenges in this industry include increased regulation of the assisted living and skilled nursing sectors. The regulatory environment continues to intensify in the number and types of laws and regulations affecting this industry, accompanied by increased enforcement activity by governmental officials.
 
Competition
 
Our competition includes other distributors of technologically advanced medical equipment and other lifestyle products and services for the elderly and operators of senior care facilities. Some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, marketing and human resources than we do. Our competitors may undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, including Internet based advertisements, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies that may allow them to build larger customer and distribution bases than ours. Our competitor’s products and services may achieve greater market acceptance than ours.
Customers
 
We have no regular customers and have had nominal operating revenues to date. We do not expect to achieve significant revenues from our medical and lifestyle equipment and service business or our senior care facilities business until the second half of 2019, at the earliest. We do not expect a single or small group of customers to account for a substantial portion of our revenues.
Employees
 
At March 8, 2019 we had three executive officers and no other employees. None of our employees are represented by a union.
 
Government Regulation
 
The healthcare industry in Asia and elsewhere is highly regulated at the local, regional and national level and is subject to evolving standards. Healthcare laws, rules and regulations require compliance with establish standards and are intended to provide safe healthcare to the general public. The costs of compliance with such rules and regulation can be significant.
Share Purchase Agreement
 
On February 18, 2016, Yuhua Xu, the controlling shareholder, Chief Executive Officer and sole director of the Company, entered into and closed on a Share Purchase Agreement with Mary Ho, Rudolf Novotny, Shan Ho, Lily Ho and Moana Ho (each a “Purchaser” and collectively, the “Purchasers”) whereby the Purchasers purchased a total of 7,990,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”) from Yuhua Xu, for an aggregate price of $223,720. The Shares acquired represented approximately 74.53% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.
Amended and Restated Articles
 
In connection with our desire to expand our business, we filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State on May 23, 2016 to:

The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation became effective on June 21, 2016 upon approval by The Financial Information Regulatory Authority.
 
Change in Fiscal Year End
 
On May 23, 2016 we changed our fiscal year end from November 30 to December 31.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

· | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
· | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

 
We may take advantage of these provisions through December 31, 2020. If certain events occur prior to December 31, 2020, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to December 31, 2020.
 
We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. We have taken advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this registration statement and may elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
 
Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure available to smaller reporting companies.
