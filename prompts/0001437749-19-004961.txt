We derive revenues principally from the following activities:
 
• | licensing of network television, cable television and radio rights to broadcast racing events 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | sales of tickets to motorsports races and other events held at our speedways 
• | sales of sponsorships and promotions to companies desiring to advertise or sell their products or services surrounding our events 
• | commissions earned on sales of food, beverages and hospitality catering (through a third-party concessionaire) 
• | event sales and commissions from motorsports souvenir merchandise 
• | rental of luxury suites during events and other track facilities 
• | track rentals for motorsports and non-motorsports events and activities and driving schools 
• | sales of smaller-scale, modified racing cars and parts 
• | radio motorsports programming, production and distribution 
• | non-event sales of wholesale and retail racing and other sports-related souvenir merchandise and apparel 
• | non-motorsport events can include popular music concerts, collegiate football games such as the 2016 “Battle at Bristol”, and various festival type activities

 
In 2018, our total revenues were comprised of 17% admissions, 47% NASCAR broadcasting, 30% other event related, and 6% other operating revenues. Many of our event related revenue streams such as sponsorship and other promotional revenues, radio broadcasting, driving schools and track rentals are with corporate partners involved in many different industries. In 2018, we derived approximately 78% of our total revenue from NASCAR-sanctioned racing events. We also derive revenue from IndyCar, NHRA, WOO, and other racing series events and various non-motorsports events and non-event merchandising operations. Our eight speedway facilities are strategically positioned in the Midwest, West, Northeast, and South United States. We believe this diversification better insulates our revenues and profitability from negative economic and geopolitical conditions in any one particular market or region of the country.
 
Long-term, Multi-year Contracted Revenues Are Significant – Many of our future revenues are already contracted, including the ten-year NASCAR television broadcast agreements through 2024 as further described below. Many of our sponsorships and corporate marketing contracts are for multiple years. Most of our NASCAR Monster Energy Cup, Xfinity and Gander Outdoors Truck Series event sponsorships for the 2019 racing season, and many for years beyond 2019, are already sold. We also have significant contracted revenues under long-term operating leases for various office, warehouse and industrial park space, track rentals and driving school activities. We believe the substantial revenue generated under such long-term contracts helps significantly solidify our financial strength, earnings and cash flows and stabilize our financial resilience and profitability during difficult economic conditions. See Notes 1 and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our businesses and activities.
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 NASCAR is generally regarded as one of the world’s most successful sports entertainment organizations. NASCAR operates three national series, the Monster Energy Cup, Xfinity and Gander Outdoors Truck Series, as well as various regional racing series in many US states, Canada, Mexico and Europe. In 2018, NASCAR sanctioned 94 Monster Energy Cup, Xfinity and Gander Outdoors Truck Series races, including “playoff” races to determine the champions for each of those three series. NASCAR races are generally heavily promoted, with a number of supporting weekend events surrounding the main event, for a total weekend experience. We believe corporate interest in the sport has been significantly driven by the attractive demographics and brand-loyalty of the NASCAR fan. Independent research shows that NASCAR fans are the most brand-loyal fans in major US sports, demonstrating why many Fortune 500 companies choose NASCAR-sanctioned events as part of their marketing strategy. Sponsors are involved in all aspects of the industry through event entitlement rights, official status designations and direct sponsorship of racing teams.
 
For 2018, the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series was the number one or two sport broadcast of the weekend fourteen times during the season, with approximately 48 million total unique television viewers and 202 million visits to NASCAR.com. Similar to many televised sports, overall seasonal averages for motorsports may increase or decrease from year to year, and television ratings for certain individual events may fluctuate from year to year for any number of reasons. Special events such as the Olympics, or the impact of poor weather surrounding our current or prior year events, can impact media competition and year over year comparability of television ratings and viewership. Trends in seasonal television ratings and viewership for NASCAR racing are following those of other major sports, including widely recognized events such as the Super Bowl, NCAA Final Four, Kentucky Derby and the Masters. Notwithstanding evolving media and content consumption, NASCAR racing continues to attract strong audiences and provides current and prospective fans and customers with expanding entertainment content and choices for their enjoyment.
 
Industry and Broadcaster Focus – Our corporate and other customers are increasingly involved in diversified non-motorsports industries, demonstrating the high marketing value of financial involvement and sponsorship in NASCAR and other motorsports racing. The demand and appeal for motorsports entertainment in our markets has remained relatively strong even in challenging circumstances. As further described in “Multi-year, Multi-platform NASCAR Broadcasting Rights” below, the ten-year media broadcasting and digital rights agreements are contracted between NASCAR, FOX Sports Media Group and NBC Sports Group through 2024. We, NASCAR and the television broadcasters continue to make sizable investments in new and expanding marketing initiatives, leading-edge facility improvements and technology that appeal to younger fans, families, and the changing demographics. We believe these media powerhouses are providing broad marketing continuity and exposure to widening demographic audiences through their Spanish-language broadcasts, website content and other ancillary programming such as nightly and weekly NASCAR-branded programming. These promotions benefit motorsports in general, similar to that provided for other major sports, and are expected to help increase long-term fan and corporate marketing appeal and interest in all three NASCAR racing series.

Competing with Evolving Media and Content Consumption – Similar to most sports, the motorsports industry is experiencing an evolving media and entertainment consumption transformation. Changing demographics, new technology and expanding online viewing options are dramatically changing how all media content is consumed, and not just that of motorsports. New and expanding entertainment options are continually being developed and marketed to attract the changing demographics, particularly outside of motorsports. We are increasingly competing with improving and expanding motorsports and non-motorsports related media coverage and content by network and cable broadcasters. Also, the ongoing improvements in high-definition television technology and expanding media, internet and on-demand content, particularly for Monster Energy Cup and Xfinity Series racing events, are increasingly influenced and used by changing demographics. These factors are significantly impacting how content is consumed. As such, we are working with NASCAR and the broadcasters on how media content can be better delivered to consumers, and continue to expand promotional efforts and initiatives as further discussed below in “Business – Operating Strategy, Our Numerous Promotional and Marketing Efforts”. These and other competition related factors are further discussed in our “Risk Factors”.
Industry Competition – Motorsports promotion is a competitive industry. We are the leading motorsports promoter in the local and regional markets served by our eight speedways. We compete for spectator interest and consumer and corporate spending with others in the motorsports industry and all forms of professional, collegiate and amateur spring, summer and fall sports - locally, regionally and nationally - as well as other forms of leisure and recreational entertainment activities. We compete with other speedway owners and promotors, particularly International Speedway Corporation (“ISC”), to sponsor events, especially Monster Energy Cup and Xfinity Series events and, to a lesser extent, other NASCAR, IndyCar, NHRA and WOO sanctioned events. We compete with other sports such as football, baseball, basketball, soccer and hockey conducted in and near Atlanta, Boston, Bristol, Charlotte, Dallas-Fort Worth, Las Vegas, Lexington/Louisville/Cincinnati, and San Francisco. We also compete for spectator interest and consumer and corporate spending with non-sports related venues and events such as concerts, shows and a widening range of other available entertainment and recreational activities in those same geographical areas. These competing events or activities may be held on the same days or weekends as our events.
Changing Demographics – In response to lower attendance and certain event related revenues, along with changing demographics, we continue to increase and expand our promotional efforts and initiatives. Much of the success of the sport of NASCAR racing has long been attributed to the enduring and unsurpassed loyalty of our fans and customer base. Similar to what other motorsports competitors and many other sporting venues are experiencing, we believe that a portion of the decline in attendance over the past few years can be attributed to changing demographics. While those long-time fans are more important to us than ever, we recognize the importance of capturing the next generation of race fans as the average age of the general population and our traditional fan base are increasing, as well as multicultural consumer groups are growing.
 
We continually search for new and innovative promotional campaigns to foster attendance by families, particularly those with younger children and teenagers. We offer many family-friendly and first-time fan programs to help educate and engage patrons who are new to the sport. We are attempting to capture the interest of the next generation of race fans through kid-friendly entertainment options, free tickets to kids under 12 for families attending NASCAR Xfinity and Gander Outdoors Truck Series races, family camping, kids’ zone play areas and kids’ clubs, as well as offering kid-sized headsets for scanners so the entire family can enjoy the race experience.
 
Ongoing Changes and Improvements in Our Sport – Similar to past years, NASCAR as a sanctioning body continues to make refinements to racing rules, championship points formats, technical changes and other adjustments to enhance on-track racing competition and excitement for generating additional fan interest. NASCAR and the motorsports industry are continuing to increase their commitment and focused efforts on diversity and race car driver and team owner development programs. NASCAR also continues its ongoing efforts to lower the barrier of entry into the sport and operating costs for team owners and manufacturers. We believe the industry’s and broadcasters’ focus on enhancing NASCAR racing competition and the sport’s appeal to younger fans and families, provides us and NASCAR with many long-term marketing and future growth opportunities.
 In another industry first, CMS began conducting annual Monster Energy Cup and Xfinity Series racing events on its new 2.28-mile "ROVAL™" infield road course in September 2018. We believe many fans find the racing on this combined superspeedway and road course novel and exciting, providing increased racing competition and new desirable sightlines and viewing areas. Similar to past seasons, NASCAR has announced several changes and improvements in its 2019 rules package for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. Many are technical and operational changes in efforts to continually improve safety and competition, and reduce operating costs for team owners and the sport. Some changes improve race car aerodynamics such as common flat splitters and elimination of the current ride-height rule at superspeedways. NASCAR’s inspection process now features a camera-based system which scans certain aspects of race cars. Other changes include significant ongoing efforts to reduce engine and other race car costs, and enhance safety such as incident data recorders and high speed in-car video cameras to improve pre-crash data.

NASCAR introduced an exciting “stage-based” race format for all three of its national series - the Monster Energy Cup, Xfinity and Gander Outdoors Truck Series. This format features three stages, providing “natural interludes” for fans and coordinated segment breaks between NASCAR and the TV broadcasters for maximizing on-track action viewing. The format also features substantial changes to how race points are awarded, with championship implications in each stage, and new qualifying procedures. Race car drivers receive points depending on their running order at the end of each stage, and the “playoff” bonus structure has been expanded and enhanced to continue throughout the entire playoffs instead of just the first round. We believe these are some of the biggest and most exciting changes in years, as drivers now need to compete for spots early in events rather than focusing towards the end of a race and over the entire racing season. NASCAR also regulated the number of pit crew members that can go “over the wall” and limited time allowed for making race car repairs.
 
In recent years, NASCAR has redesigned competition rules to restore “pack racing”, “double-file restarts”, changes in field sizes, larger “restart zones”, pit road timing, new “overtime” procedures for finishing races, more consistent race start times, and relaxing on-track rules and regulations. NASCAR extended the “Playoff” format to the Xfinity and Gander Outdoors Truck Series, and changed the participation rules so that race car drivers can compete for championship points in only one of NASCAR’s top three racing series. NASCAR also announced team owner Charter agreements for its Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series with 36 teams, and established a Team Owner Council that has formal input into decisions, and is designed to provide Charter teams with more stability and new revenue opportunities.
 
MULTI-YEAR, MULTI-PLATFORM NASCAR BROADCASTING RIGHTS
 Broadcasting revenues continue to be a significant long-term revenue source for our core business. A substantial portion of our profits in recent years has resulted from revenues received under broadcasting rights contracts between NASCAR and various television networks (47% of our total revenues in 2018). The ten-year television broadcasting agreements through 2024 were negotiated and contracted by NASCAR. We participate in these multi-platform and media partnership agreements with NASCAR, FOX Sports Media Group and NBC Sports Group for the broadcasting and digital rights to all (on a combined basis) Monster Energy NASCAR Cup, Xfinity and Gander Outdoors Truck Series racing events, as well as certain NASCAR K&N Pro Series and Whelen Modified Tour events. NASCAR announcements have valued the industry broadcasting contracts at more than $8.2 billion over ten years, representing approximately $820 million in gross average annual rights fees for the industry and an approximate 46% increase over the previous contract annual average of $560 million. These ten-year broadcasting agreements are anticipated to provide us contracted revenue increases of almost four percent annually. Our total contracted NASCAR broadcasting revenues are expected to approximate $226 million in 2019. SMI has separate five-year Event Management Agreements (purse and sanction agreements) with NASCAR under which our speedways conduct Monster Energy NASCAR Cup, Xfinity and Gander Outdoors Truck Series and the All-Star Race events through 2020. These agreements contain annual increases in event management fees of three to four percent.
 
These broadcasting agreements include various “TV Everywhere” rights that allow 24-hour video-on-demand, expanded live-streaming and re-telecasting of certain races, in-progress and finished race highlights, replays of FOX-televised races to a Fox Sports-affiliated website, broadcasting rights for Spanish-language broadcasts, website content and other ancillary programming, as well as nightly and weekend NASCAR news and information shows. These rights are important to the broadcasters, and in turn industry stakeholders, for monetizing alternative digital delivery methods of NASCAR content and the evolving ways live sports content is consumed. NASCAR announced that "secondary ancillary rights" fees will be distributed 60% to teams, 30% to promoters (such as the Company) and 10% to NASCAR. These would be non-live broadcast rights for highlights and other digital content, including licensing to fantasy games for use of driver and team images. We believe there is increasing long-term value to those ancillary rights; however, we do not control the annual profitability shared with industry-wide participants.
 
OPERATING STRATEGY
 A key component of our operating strategy is to own and operate first-class, modern facilities in premier geographic markets, and provide our individual and corporate fans and customers with the best entertainment experience and marketing value in our motorsports industry. Since the 1970’s, we have continually improved the race experience enjoyed by our fans, sponsors, team owners and drivers, media and others attending and involved in our racing and other motorsports and non-motorsports events and activities. Our historical and ongoing efforts to attract fans, corporate and other clientele, and provide enhanced facility comfort, enjoyment and entertainment value to our current and new prospective fans are further described below.
 
Our operating strategy is to increase revenues and profitability through the promotion and production of racing and related events at our strategically positioned modern facilities, including four of the top-ten media markets. We believe this strategy serves to enhance customer loyalty and satisfaction, and helps market and distribute racing and other sports-related souvenir, apparel and other merchandise. We market our scheduled events throughout the year - locally, regionally and nationally - using extensive and innovative marketing activities. In particular, we concentrate on further developing long-term contracted revenue streams, which are less susceptible to weather and economic conditions. We believe our objectives can be achieved by increasing revenues at existing facilities, and by expanding our promotional and marketing expertise to take advantage of opportunities in attractive existing and new markets and activities. Successful speedway operations require significant capital investments, marketing, promotional and operational expertise, and license agreements with NASCAR and other sanctioning bodies. Those factors, along with high media intensity and enhanced on-track competition, are expected to drive increases in fan appeal and the long-term value of our sponsorship and other marketing rights. The key components of this strategy are described below.
 
Modern, Innovative and Entertaining Facilities – Over many years, we have built and modernized our permanent grandstand seating and luxury suites, offering outstanding views, stadium-style terrace sections, wider and more comfortable seating, convenient elevator access, popular food courts and unique mezzanine level souvenir, concessions and restroom facilities. We believe our facilities are some of the finest in the industry, and offer superior spectator enjoyment, convenience and accessibility. Lighting is installed at all SMI speedways, except SR and NHMS, so that we can offer nighttime racing. We have installed and greatly expanded “SAFER” crash walls and other safety barriers at all SMI speedways to help improve the safety of race drivers and others using our facilities. The banking of several of our speedways has been reprofiled and resurfaced to offer our fans increased excitement inherent in high-bank racing, which have been well received by many race car drivers. SMI has built trackside condominiums at AMS, CMS and TMS. We have built or reconstructed dragstrips at BMS, CMS, LVMS and SR, featuring modern, innovative facilities with permanent grandstand seating, luxury suites and extensive fan amenities. Our zMAX Dragway at CMS was the industry’s first to feature revolutionary, unique “four lane” racing. We have since expanded “The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway” into a similar distinctive and exciting “four lane” dragway. We believe these are two of the finest facilities in drag racing. Our other facilities include The Speedway Club at CMS and The Speedway Club at TMS, both containing exclusive dining and entertainment facilities and executive offices adjoining the main grandstands and overlooking the superspeedways. These VIP clubs are open year-round and offer exclusive race day privileges, first-class restaurants, catering and corporate meeting accommodations, and at TMS, health-club, salon and spa facilities.

The “Neon Garage” built at LVMS is one of the most modern and extensive infield media centers, garage and fan-zone entertainment facilities in motorsports. LVMS’s “Neon Garage” is a desirable focal place for racing drivers, team owners and others involved in motorsports during major racing events. We have built or expanded premium suite, pavilion, hospitality and fan-zone entertainment areas along and close to pit road and grandstands, featuring upscale amenities and outstanding views of the entire superspeedway, at several of our speedways. Many of our speedways have open-air, luxury infield suites located along or close to pit road, and high-end RV parking and campground areas. These areas feature upscale hospitality and other amenities and outstanding views of the entire speedways. CMS has 40 open-air boxes, each containing 32 seats, featuring convenient access to high-end food and beverages and waiter services, which are rented to corporate customers or others.
 
We have modernized our ticket offices and gift shops to increase fan appeal, and expanded our camping, RV and hospitality facilities to meet the growing demand from fans who seek that entertainment experience surrounding our events. We have built extensive infield media centers, garage and entertainment facilities with modern technology infrastructure and access for increased appeal to media content providers, sports journalists, racing team owners and drivers, race fans and others involved in motorsports. Our leading-edge facilities also feature modern leaderboards, new sound systems, hillside terrace seats, pit road suites, underground pedestrian tunnels, widened concourses and other expanded pedestrian infrastructure, among many other modernizing improvements. We have reconfigured and expanded parking areas and on-site roadways, and revamped traffic patterns for better traffic flow at all of our speedways. We plan to continue modernizing and making other significant customer service enhancements at our speedways, all consistent with our commitment to quality, entertainment value and customer satisfaction for spectator benefit. See “Properties” for additional information on each of our speedways.
 
Facility Repurposing and Renovation – From time to time, we renovate various seating, suite and other spectator gathering areas at our speedways for modernizing our facilities, alternative marketing or development purposes. This modernization includes offering unique fan entertainment zones, expanded premium “spectator-box” seating, hospitality and RV camping areas, or wider seating and improved sight lines. Many areas are similar to high end “taverns” or “pubs” and sports bars, close to our restart zones. CMS has a “Sun Deck” with nearby solar panels. Those, along with solar panels at certain other speedways, are part of our “green initiatives”. We may sell advertising, fixed billboards and other promotional space on wide repurposed areas, and wide areas of backstretch. We believe repurposing and alternative use of these desirable advertising areas helps improve pricing power, and provides increased marketing appeal of fuller grandstands because those areas are frequently displayed during television broadcasts, in photos, and are viewable by large numbers of fans attending our speedways. While generating other facility revenues, removal also reduces ongoing depreciation and certain other operating costs.
 
As further described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in our “Risk Factors”, we recorded significant charges for non-cash accelerated depreciation and costs of removal related to modernization and repurposing of certain seating and other speedway facilities in recent years. In 2019, we plan to continue similar activities at certain speedways. Among other modernization, we are replacing every other seating row with drink rails in many areas, offering our fans significantly more leg room and expanded comfort for consuming food and beverages. We anticipate recording charges for non-cash accelerated depreciation and costs of removal in 2019, in amounts yet to be determined, but which could be material.
 
Significant Investments in Leading-Edge Technology, Appealing to Younger Fans – We are increasingly competing with improving and expanding non-motorsports related media coverage and content by network and cable broadcasters, and with ongoing improvements in high-definition television technology and increasing DVR use and on-demand content, particularly for Monster Energy Cup and Xfinity Series racing events. We recognize the increasing importance of providing our fans with compelling entertainment experiences that cannot be duplicated at home or other venues. We have made major investments in three of the world’s largest high-definition video boards at BMS in 2016, TMS in 2014 and CMS in 2011. These video boards significantly enhance the entertainment experience of fans at our events, and are providing expanded promotional opportunities. We also installed new sound systems and higher-end leader boards at several of our speedways. We have installed distributed antenna systems (“DAS”) or comparable technology at each of our speedways. This new technology is providing our race fans and corporate customers with improved wireless performance and connectivity options and the latest in digital applications while attending our events. These systems, similar to technology other major sport venues are deploying, also provide infrastructure for expanding wireless internet coverage and applications.
 
We are significantly investing in social media advertising, interactive mobile phone apps for fans, real-time marketing and entertainment, web-based applications and interactive digital systems to enhance pre-race and during-the-race entertainment experiences that appeal to our younger demographic markets. We believe this high-end technology transforms the race experience for our fans, and helps attract younger and new fans. We also recognize the increasing importance of providing our current and prospective corporate customers with quantitative and qualitative information on the historical and prospective value and returns on their invested marketing spending with us. This information is important to us for customizing and tailoring marketing strategies that help maximize our customers’ spending, and allowing us to better understand and integrate their business marketing strategies and develop effective content. We are also increasingly investing in marketing analysis and web-based technology platforms and applications. While these investments are fairly costly, we believe them to be worthwhile.

Our Numerous Promotional and Marketing Efforts – We believe marketing our scheduled events throughout the year locally, regionally and nationally is important. Along with innovative television, radio, newspaper and other traditional media promotions, we market our events and services using a wide variety of other programs and activities, including the internet and social media. We believe our initiatives, along with other factors discussed elsewhere, are encouraging increased attendance, but are unable to quantify the timing or amount of any future impact. Our marketing programs also include soliciting prospective event sponsors. Sponsorship provisions for a typical NASCAR event can include corporate promotional fan engagement zones and displays, luxury suite rentals, block ticket sales and catered hospitality, as well as souvenir race program and track signage advertising.
 
We have an exclusive long-term food and beverage management agreement with Levy Premium Foodservice Limited Partnership (“Levy”) through 2028 to provide on-site food, beverage, and hospitality catering services for essentially all events and operations at our speedways. We believe a consolidated food and beverage services agreement enables us to provide better products and expanded services to our customers. We offer high-end venues to corporate and other clientele desiring premium-quality menu choices and service, enhancing their overall entertainment experience, while allowing us to achieve substantial operating efficiencies. We are continually expanding and enhancing our premium food and beverage offerings in unique fan zones and modern hospitality areas, many similar to high end “taverns” or “pubs” and sports bars.
 
Many aspects of our marketing and promotional efforts include:
 

• | participation in track councils and organized fan advisory boards to continually improve entertainment experience and value 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | working with local lodging proprietors to lower prices and reduce or eliminate minimum stay requirements 
• | preferred pricing, gifts and payment plans and programs that honor and reward renewals, long-time fans and continued patronage 
• | interactive fan mobile phone applications and real-time marketing and entertainment 
• | new, lower children ticket pricing – including free tickets for children with attending families for various events 
• | promotional campaigns to incentivize earlier ticket purchasing, season ticket package renewal and purchases by families 
• | rainout and weather policies for various ticket holders 
• | code of conduct text response systems, similar to other major sports venues 
• | marketing on popular social media websites 
• | marketing on internet sites offering detailed seat information and other ticket buying conveniences 
• | marketing on emerging internet sites with motorsports news and entertainment 
• | direct mail and e-mail campaigns 
• | pre-race promotional activities such as live music, fan engagement areas, military aircraft flyovers, ferris wheels, skydivers and daredevil stunts
• | offering tours of our facilities 

Maximization of Media Exposure and Enhancement of Sponsorship and Other Promotional Revenues – We are strategically positioned with eight first-class speedway facilities in the Midwest, West, Northeast, and South United States, including four of the nation’s top-ten media markets, with combined permanent seating of approximately 692,000 as of December 31, 2018. Our speedway facilities are located in Dallas-Fort Worth, Las Vegas and San Francisco markets, providing us with critical mass west of the Mississippi River that enhances our overall operations, as well as sponsorship and other marketing opportunities. Our Atlanta, Bristol and Charlotte Motor Speedways are located in the South, which is considered the “heart” of racing. KyS is located approximately one-half hour south of the Midwestern city of Cincinnati, Ohio, and strategically positioned between the desirable markets of Lexington and Louisville, Kentucky. Our NHMS, about one hour north of Boston, is located in one of the largest media markets in North America.
 
We sell tickets to fans located in all 50 US states and many foreign countries. We seek to increase the visibility of our racing events and facilities through local, regional and national media interaction. We have built modern media centers with leading-edge technology infrastructure and access for increased appeal to media content providers, sports journalists, racing team owners and drivers and others involved in motorsports. For example, each January we sponsor a one-day tour at TMS to promote the upcoming Monster Energy NASCAR Cup season. This event features popular NASCAR drivers and attracts media personnel representing television networks and stations from throughout the United States and around the world. Also, from time to time, SMI and top NASCAR drivers have teamed up to conduct “Fan Forums” that are produced by our Performance Racing Network. These fan appeal programs include question-and-answer sessions with NASCAR’s top drivers during Monster Energy Cup race weekends. We believe these programs appeal to our fans and create additional interest and excitement between fans, drivers and team owners.
 
SMI Properties, Performance Racing Network and US Legend Cars Businesses – Our SMI Properties subsidiaries, including SMI Trackside, provide event and non-event souvenir merchandising services at our speedways, non-SMI speedways and other outside venues. We believe opportunities exist for merchandising of motorsports and non-motorsports products. SMI Properties and SMI Trackside seek to enhance souvenir and other merchandise sales and screen-printing and embroidery services through expanded product offerings and new marketing arrangements.
 
We broadcast most of our Monster Energy NASCAR Cup and Xfinity Series racing events, as well as many other events, at each of our speedways over our proprietary Performance Racing Network. PRN is syndicated nationwide to several hundred radio stations. Along with broadcasting our racing events, PRN produces innovative daily and weekly racing-oriented programs throughout the NASCAR season. We also own Racing Country USA, our national country music and NASCAR-themed radio show syndicated to several hundred affiliates nationwide. The combination of PRN’s and Racing Country USA’s national syndication networks, with SiriusXM Satellite Radio and NASCAR.com, offers sponsors a powerful and expansive promotional network.

US Legend Cars International continues to develop new domestic and overseas markets for distribution of their race cars and parts. Our subsidiary INEX is the official international sanctioning body of the Legends Circuit, and is the third largest oval short-track auto racing sanctioning body in terms of membership behind NASCAR and the International Motor Contest Association. US Legend Cars manufactures and sells the cars and parts used in Legends Circuit racing events. The “original” Legend Cars are 5/8-scale versions of the modified classic sedans and coupes driven by legendary early NASCAR racers, and are designed primarily to race on “short” tracks of 3/8-mile or less. As an extension of the original Legend Cars concept, US Legend Cars also manufactures the “Bandolero”, a smaller, lower-priced, entry level stock car which appeals to younger racing enthusiasts.
 
In 2018, US Legend Cars International introduced a new engine for the Legend Cars. This marked the first time that a new engine with as many technical advances was incorporated into Legends Circuit racing events. This new engine is a water-cooled, fuel injected, 900cc engine that is electronically managed by an internally developed proprietary engine management system. With advanced engine cooling features, US Legend Cars International can now enter new international markets with high ambient temperatures. 
 
We believe the Legend Car is one of only a few complete race cars manufactured in the United States for a retail price of less than $15,000, and is an affordable entry into racing for enthusiasts who otherwise could not race on an organized circuit. Cars and parts are currently marketed and sold through distributors conducting business throughout the United States, in Canada, the Middle East, Russia, South Korea, Australia, Japan, South America, Africa, Europe and other countries. The Legends Circuit, which includes both race models, held over 1,800 sanctioned races at over 150 different tracks in 2018, making it one of the most active short-track racing divisions in motorsports. We plan to continue broadening the Legends Circuit, increasing the number of sanctioned races and tracks where races are held.
 
Increased Daily Usage of Existing Facilities – We actively seek revenue-producing uses for our speedway facilities on days not committed to racing events. Our many other uses include driving schools, track rentals, concerts, car and truck shows, auto fair shows, free-style motocross and monster truck events, vehicle testing, settings for television commercials, holiday season festivities, print advertisements and motion pictures. We hold several NHRA and other bracket racing events throughout the year at our BMS, CMS, LVMS and SR dragways, and at AMS and TMS (using superspeedway pit roads and other facilities), along with holding frequent Legend Cars racing events at several of our speedways.
 
In another first, BMS hosted a collegiate football game between the University of Tennessee and Virginia Tech, “the Battle at Bristol, College Football's Biggest Ever”, including a large preceding concert, in 2016. Both events were hugely successful with intense media coverage and fanfare, and is included in the Guinness World Records as the highest attended collegiate football game in history. BMS also hosted another collegiate football game between East Tennessee State University and Western Carolina University the following weekend, although not as large. We are actively seeking to host additional football games, although none have been scheduled at this time.
 
LVMS has more than thirteen different paved and dirt track configurations, including a modern driving school and road course. LVMS hosts large track rentals used by car manufacturers for rallies and other corporate functions, and we plan to continue capitalizing on LVMS’s top market entertainment value and promote new expanded venues. Our larger road courses at AMS, CMS, LVMS, NHMS, SR and TMS are rented for various activities such as driving schools, series racing and vehicle testing. Also, CMS, LVMS and TMS own 4/10-mile, modern, lighted, dirt track facilities where nationally-televised events such as WOO Series, as well as AMA, events have been held. In recent years, LVMS and TMS have held popular and successful Red Bull Air Race World Championship events.
 
Other examples of increased usage include holiday season festivities at most of our speedways, including “Speedway Christmas,” a long drive-through Christmas light-park and village at CMS, and BMS’s holiday season “Speedway In Lights”, which are prominent in those regions. LVMS continues to annually host the widely-popular Electric Daisy Carnival concert, attracting large numbers of young fans. At times, we host concerts featuring popular bands at stand-alone events and frequently as entertainment before and after our racing events. We are exploring holding larger stand-alone concerts with popular musical acts at certain speedway facilities. CMS and TMS hold auto fair shows and Goodguys Rod & Custom Association Nationals and other car shows, also very popular. In past years, we have held Global RallyCross events at CMS, LVMS, NHMS and TMS that featured exciting off-road circuit racing, particularly popular with younger fans, and snowmobile racing events at NHMS.
 
Acquisition and Development – We consider growth by acquisition and development of motorsports facilities as appropriate opportunities arise. We attempt to locate, acquire, develop and operate venues and facilities that we believe are underdeveloped or underutilized, and to capitalize on markets where sponsorship and other promotional pricing and television broadcasting rights are lucrative. We also look for profitable opportunities to grow our existing ancillary businesses through acquisitions, joint ventures or similar arrangements.

EMPLOYEES
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 748 full-time and 282 part-time employees. We hire temporary employees and use volunteers to assist during periods of peak attendance at our events. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe we enjoy a good relationship with our employees.
INSURANCE
 We maintain property, casualty, liability, and business interruption insurance with insurers we believe to be financially sound. Our insurance policies generally cover accidents that may occur at our speedways, subject to ordinary course deductibles, policy limits and exceptions. As further described in our “Risk Factors”, we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedway and other properties, and motorsports events and other business risks. We believe our insurance levels are sufficient for our needs and consistent with insurance maintained by similar companies.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We have numerous registered and common law trademark rights. We also have registered trademark rights in Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and the European Union. We also have one patent pending related to Catch Fence design and technology. Our policy is to protect our intellectual property rights zealously, including use of litigation, if necessary, to protect their proprietary value in sale and market recognition.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 Solid waste landfilling has occurred on and around CMS’s property for many years. Landfilling of general categories of municipal solid waste on the CMS property ceased in 1992. However, there is one landfill at CMS currently being permitted to receive inert debris and waste from land clearing activities (“LCID” landfill), and one LCID landfill that was closed in 1999. Two other LCID landfills on the CMS property were closed in 1994. CMS intends to allow similar LCID landfills to be operated on the CMS property in the future. Prior to 1999, CMS leased a portion of our property to Allied Waste Industries, Inc. (“Allied”) for use as a construction and demolition debris landfill (a “C&D” landfill), which received solid waste resulting solely from construction, remodeling, repair or demolition operations on pavement, buildings or other structures, but could not receive inert debris, land-clearing debris or yard debris. The CMS C&D landfill is now closed. In addition, Allied owns and operates an active solid waste landfill adjacent to CMS. We believe the active solid waste landfill was constructed in such a manner as to minimize the risk of contamination to surrounding property. Management believes that our operations, including the landfills on our property, comply with all applicable federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Management is not aware of any situation related to landfill operations which would have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or results of operations.
 
Portions of the inactive solid waste landfill areas on the CMS property are subject to a groundwater monitoring program, and data is submitted to the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (“DENR”). DENR has noted that data from certain groundwater sampling events have indicated levels of certain regulated compounds that exceed acceptable trigger levels and organic compounds that exceed regulatory groundwater standards. DENR has not required any remedial action by us at this time with respect to this situation. If DENR was to require us to take certain actions in the future, although none are known at this time, those actions could result in us incurring material costs.
