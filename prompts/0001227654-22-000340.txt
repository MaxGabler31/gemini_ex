ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Compass Minerals is a leading provider of essential minerals focused on safely delivering where and when it matters to help solve nature’s challenges for customers and communities. Our salt products help keep roadways safe during winter weather and are used in numerous other consumer, industrial, chemical and agricultural applications. Our plant nutrition products help improve the quality and yield of crops, while supporting sustainable agriculture. Additionally, we are pursuing development of a sustainable lithium brine resource to support the North American battery market and we are a minority owner of Fortress North America, a next-generation fire retardant company. As of September 30, 2022, we operate 12 production and packaging facilities with nearly 2,000 employees throughout the U.S., Canada and the U.K., including: 
•The largest underground rock salt mine in the world in Goderich, Ontario, Canada;
•The largest dedicated rock salt mine in the U.K. in Winsford, Cheshire;
•A solar evaporation facility located near Ogden, Utah, which is both the largest sulfate of potash specialty fertilizer (“SOP”) production site, the largest solar salt production site in the Western Hemisphere and the source of the lithium resource that we intend to develop; and
•Several mechanical evaporation facilities producing consumer and industrial salt
See Item 2, “Properties,” for a discussion of our mining properties, including processing methods, facilities, production and summaries of our mineral resources and reserves, both in the aggregate and for our individual material mining properties.
Our Salt segment provides highway deicing salt to customers in North America and the U.K. as well as consumer deicing and water conditioning products, ingredients used in consumer and commercial food preparation and other salt-based products for consumer, industrial, chemical and agricultural applications in North America. In the U.K., we operate a records management business utilizing excavated areas of our Winsford salt mine with one other location in London, England. 
Our Plant Nutrition segment produces and markets SOP products in various grades domestically and internationally to distributors and retailers of crop inputs, as well as growers and for industrial uses. We market our SOP under the trade name Protassium+®. 
We sell our salt and plant nutrition products primarily in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. See Part II, Item 8, Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information relating to our operations by geographic areas. 
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 (“fiscal 2020”), we initiated an evaluation of the strategic fit of certain of our businesses. On February 16, 2021, we announced our plan to restructure our former Plant Nutrition South America segment to enable targeted and separate sales processes for each portion of the former segment, including our chemicals and specialty plant nutrition businesses along with our equity method investment in Fermavi Eletroquímica Ltda. (“Fermavi”). Concurrently, to optimize our asset base in North America, we evaluated the strategic fit of our North America micronutrient product business. On March 16, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell our South America chemicals and specialty plant nutrition businesses, our investment in Fermavi and our North America micronutrient product business (collectively, the “Specialty Businesses”) with the goal of reducing our leverage and enabling increased focus on optimizing our core businesses. 
As described further in Part II, Item 8, Note 1 and Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on March 23, 2021, April 7, 2021, June 28, 2021 and April 20, 2022, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our South America specialty plant nutrition business, a component of our North America micronutrient business, our Fermavi investment and our South America chemicals business, respectively. The South America specialty plant nutrition business sale closed on July 1, 2021, the North America micronutrient sale closed on May 4, 2021, the sale of our Fermavi investment closed on August 20, 2021 and the sale of our South America chemicals business closed on April 20, 2022. In the first quarter of 2021, we concluded that certain of our assets met the criteria for classification as held for sale and discontinued operations. As a result, we are presenting two reportable segments in continuing operations, Salt and Plant Nutrition (which was previously known as the Plant Nutrition North America segment) in this Form 10-K. See Part II, Item 8, Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
We believe these dispositions were conducted through a single disposal plan representing a strategic shift that had a material effect on our operations and financial results. Consequently, the Specialty Businesses qualified for presentation as assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Accordingly, current and noncurrent assets and liabilities of the Specialty Businesses are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets and liabilities held for sale for the periods presented and their results of operations are presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented.

SALT SEGMENT
Overview
Salt is indispensable and enormously versatile with thousands of reported uses. In addition, there are no known cost-effective alternatives for most high-volume uses. Through the use of effective mining techniques and efficient production processes, we leverage our high-grade salt deposits, which are among the most extensive in the world. Further, many of our Salt segment assets are in locations that are logistically favorable to our core markets. Our strategy for this segment is to focus on driving profitability from every ton we produce through cost efficiency as well as commercial and operational execution.
Through our Salt segment, we produce, market and sell salt (sodium chloride) and magnesium chloride in North America and sodium chloride in the U.K. Our Salt products include rock salt, mechanically-evaporated salt, solar-evaporated salt, brine magnesium chloride and flake magnesium chloride. While we also purchase potassium chloride (“KCl”) and calcium chloride to sell as finished products or to blend with sodium chloride to produce specialty products. Sodium chloride represents the vast majority of the products we produce, market and sell. In fiscal 2022, the Salt segment accounted for approximately 81% of our sales (see Part II, Item 8, Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for segment financial information). 
Salt segment sales as a percentage of total sales from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 are as follows:
Our Salt segment products are used in a wide variety of applications, including as a deicer for roadways, consumer and professional use, as an ingredient in chemical production, for water treatment, human and animal nutrition and for a variety of other consumer and industrial uses.
Historical demand for salt has remained relatively stable during periods of rising prices and through a variety of economic cycles due to its relatively low cost and diverse number of end uses. As a result, our cash flows from our Salt segment are not materially impacted by economic cycles. However, demand for deicing salt products is primarily affected by the number and intensity of snow events and temperatures in our service territories.

Salt Industry Overview
In our primary markets, we estimate that the consumption of highway deicing rock salt in North America, including rock salt used in chemical manufacturing processes, is approximately 39 million tons per year, assuming average winter weather conditions, while the consumer and industrial market is approximately 10 million tons per year. In the U.K., we estimate that the consumption of highway deicing salt is approximately 2 million tons per year, assuming average winter weather conditions. We also estimate that salt consumption in the U.S. has increased at a long-term historical average rate of flat to approximately 1% per year, although there have been recent fluctuations above and below this average driven primarily by winter weather variability.
Salt prices vary according to purity, end use and variations in refining and packaging processes. Management estimates that salt prices in the U.S. have increased at a long-term historical average rate of approximately 3% to 4% per year, although there have been recent fluctuations above and below this average. Due to salt’s relatively low production cost, transportation and handling costs tend to be a significant component of the total delivered cost, which makes logistics management and customer service key competitive factors in the industry. The high relative cost associated with transportation of salt tends to favor producers located nearest to customers.
Products and Sales
We sell our Salt segment products through our highway deicing product line (which includes brine magnesium chloride as well as rock salt treated with this mineral) and our consumer and industrial product line (which includes salt as well as products containing magnesium chloride and calcium chloride in both pure form and blended with salt). 
Highway deicing, including salt sold to chemical customers, constituted 63% of our fiscal 2022 Salt segment sales. Our principal customers are states, provinces, counties, municipalities and road maintenance contractors that purchase bulk deicing salt, both treated and untreated, for ice control on public roadways. Highway deicing salt in North America is sold primarily through an annual tendered bid contract process with governmental entities, as well as through multi-year contracts, with price, product quality and delivery capabilities as the primary competitive market factors. Some sales also occur through negotiated sales contracts with third-party customers, particularly in the U.K. Since transportation costs are a relatively large portion of the delivered cost of our products to customers, locations of salt sources and distribution networks also play a significant role in the ability of suppliers to cost-effectively serve customers. We have an extensive network of approximately 80 depots for storage and distribution of highway deicing salt in North America. The majority of these depots are located on the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River and Ohio River systems. Deicing salt product from our Ogden facility supplies customers in the Western and upper Midwest regions of the U.S. Treated rock salt, which is typically rock salt with magnesium chloride brine and organic materials that enhance the salt’s performance, is sold throughout our markets.
We believe our production capability at our Winsford mine and favorable logistics position enhance our ability to meet the U.K.’s winter demands. Due to our strong position, we are viewed as a key supplier by the U.K.’s Highways Agency. In the U.K., approximately 75% of our highway deicing customers have multi-year contracts.
Winter weather variability is the most significant factor affecting salt sales for deicing applications, because mild winters reduce the need for salt used in ice and snow control. On average, over the last three years, approximately two-thirds of our deicing product sales occurred during the North American and European winter months of November through March. The vast majority of our North American deicing sales are made in Canada and the Midwestern U.S. where inclement weather during the winter months causes dangerous road conditions. In keeping with industry practice, we stockpile salt to meet estimated requirements for the next winter season. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Seasonality” for more information on the seasonality of our Salt segment results.
Our principal chemical customers are producers of intermediate chemical products used in the production of vinyls and other chemicals, pulp and paper, as well as water treatment and a variety of other industrial uses. We typically have multi-year supply agreements with these customers. Price, service, product quality and security of supply are the major competitive market factors.
Sales of our consumer and industrial products accounted for 37% of our fiscal 2022 Salt segment sales. We are the third largest producer of consumer and industrial salt products in North America. These products include commercial and consumer applications, such as water conditioning, consumer and professional ice control, food processing, agricultural applications, table salt and a variety of industrial applications. We believe we are among the largest private-label producers of water conditioning salt in North America and of table salt in Canada. Our Sifto brand encompasses a full line of salt products, which are well recognized in Canada.
Our consumer and industrial business has broad product lines with both private-label and Company brands. Our consumer and industrial product line is distributed through many channels, including retail, agricultural, industrial, janitorial and sanitation, and resellers. These consumer and industrial products are channeled from our plants and third-party warehouses to our customers using a combination of direct sales personnel, contract personnel and a network of brokers or manufacturers’ representatives.

The chart below shows our annual sales volumes of Salt segment products for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020:

Competition
We face strong competition in each of the markets in which we operate. In North America, other large, nationally and internationally recognized companies compete with our Salt segment products. In addition, there are also several smaller regional producers of salt. There are several importers of salt into North America, which mostly impact the East Coast and West Coast of the U.S. where we have minimal market presence. Two competitors serve the highway deicing salt market in the U.K., one in Northern England and one in Northern Ireland. Typically, there are not significant imports of highway deicing salt into the U.K. 
Salt is a commodity, which limits the potential for product differentiation and increases competition. Additionally, low barriers to entry in the consumer and industrial markets increase competition. Our advantageous geographical locations, superior assets and distribution network strengthen our competitive position. 
PLANT NUTRITION SEGMENT
Industry Overview
Fertilizers are critical for efficient crop production using the limited arable land resources available around the world. The nutrients needed to ensure plant health can be divided into three categories: 
•macro nutrients - the traditional NPK fertilizers (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K)); 
•secondary nutrients - calcium, magnesium and sulfur; and 
•specialty plant nutrients - trace elements of iron, manganese, copper, boron, zinc, molybdenum, chlorine and nickel.
Factors influencing the plant nutrition market include world grain and food supply, currency fluctuations, weather and climate change, grower incomes, changes in consumer diets, general levels of economic activity, government food programs, governmental agriculture and energy policies in the U.S. and around the world, and the amount or type of crop grown in certain locations, or the type or amount of fertilizer product used. In addition, our Plant Nutrition segment results can be impacted by seasonality (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Seasonality” for more information). 
Our Plant Nutrition segment currently generates nearly all of its sales and earnings through the production and sale of SOP. There are two major forms of potassium-based fertilizer, SOP, a specialty form of potassium which also provides plant-ready sulfur, and muriate of potash (“MOP” or “KCl”). Based on data from Green Markets® A Bloomberg Company, management estimates the average annual worldwide consumption of all potash fertilizers is approximately 88 million tons, with MOP accounting for approximately 88% of all potash used in fertilizer production. SOP represents approximately 9% of all potash production. The remainder of potash is supplied in forms containing varying concentrations of potassium (expressed as potassium oxide) along with different combinations of co-nutrients. SOP, which contains the equivalent of approximately 50% potassium oxide, maintains a price premium over MOP due to the fact that it contains the secondary nutrient, sulfur, does not contain chlorides and is more expensive to produce than MOP. Additionally, many high-value or chloride-sensitive crops experience improved yields and quality when SOP is applied instead of MOP. SOP is also a more cost-effective alternative to other forms of specialty potash. 
Our SOP sales are primarily concentrated in the Western and Southeastern U.S. where the crops and soil conditions favor the use of low-chloride potassium nutrients. Consequently, weather patterns and field conditions in these locations can impact Plant Nutrition sales volumes.

COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

While long-term global consumption of potash has increased in response to growing populations and the need for additional food supplies, the market for commodity potash has been challenged in recent years due to downturns in the broader crop market which pressure grower incomes. However, recently improved economics for row crops has led to an improved commodity potash market. Additionally, demand for our SOP products has been resilient despite the challenges facing the global potash market.
We expect the long-term demand for potassium nutrients to continue to grow as arable land per capita decreases, thereby encouraging improved crop yield efficiencies. We expect our future growth to stem from the conversion of certain commodity potassium applications into higher yield SOP applications. 
Approximately 87% of our Plant Nutrition segment sales in fiscal 2022 were made to U.S. customers, who include retail fertilizer dealers and distributors of agricultural products as well as professional turf care customers. In some cases, these dealers and distributors combine or blend our Plant Nutrition segment products with other fertilizers and minerals to produce fertilizer blends tailored to individual requirements. 
Products and Sales
We currently generate nearly all of our sales and earnings in our Plant Nutrition segment through the production and sale of SOP. Our SOP is sold in various grades under our Protassium+ brand. Our Protassium+ product line consists of different grades sized for use in broadcast spreaders, direct application and liquid fertilizer solutions. Our turf product line consists of grades sized for use by the turf and ornamental markets and for blends used on golf course greens. We also provide an organic product line with grades sized for a wide range of applications. 
Our Protassium+ product line is generally sold to crop input distributors and dealers who may blend our products with other fertilizer products to sell to farmers and growers, or it may be sold as the final product. Our commercial efforts focus on educating and selling the agronomic benefits of SOP as a source of potassium nutrients.
Competition
SOP is marketed globally, with approximately 55% of the world’s 10 million tons of estimated capacity located in China. Management estimates global SOP capacity to be as follows: 
Source: Green Markets ® A Bloomberg Company
We are the leading SOP producer and marketer in North America and we also market SOP products internationally, depending on market conditions. Our major competition for SOP sales in North America includes imports from the European Union. Fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar coupled with Baltic freight rates impact the level of international competition we face. As the only SOP producer with production facilities in North America, and as a result of our logistically favorable production site near Ogden, Utah, we estimate that our share of the North American market is sizable. In addition to imported SOP, there is functional competition between SOP and other forms of potassium crop nutrients, such as MOP. The specialty plant nutrient market is highly fragmented. Commodity and specialty crops require specialty plant nutrients in varying degrees depending on the crop and soil conditions.

OTHER
DeepStore is our records management business in the U.K. that utilizes portions of previously excavated space in our salt mine in Winsford, Cheshire, for secure underground document storage and one warehouse location in London, England. Currently, DeepStore does not have a significant share of the document storage market in the U.K., and it is not material in comparison to our Salt and Plant Nutrition segments.
OTHER INVESTMENTS
Lithium
Our Ogden facility produces SOP, salt and magnesium chloride products from the high mineral concentrations within the ambient lake brine in the Great Salt Lake. In 2021, we identified a lithium brine resource at our Ogden site and began a strategic evaluation to assess development options to service growing U.S. domestic lithium demand.
We believe our lithium resource in the Great Salt Lake’s north arm is among the most attractive undeveloped North American lithium brine asset. Our current operations at Ogden include a 55,000 acre developed pond system and leases totaling over 170,000 acres. We also believe we will be able to benefit from several synergies related to our existing operations at Ogden, including infrastructure, logistics and pond operations that we will utilize for our lithium resource. By leveraging existing operational infrastructure, permits, water rights and pond processes to extract lithium as a co-product of our long-standing SOP, salt and magnesium chloride production at our Ogden facility, the incremental environmental footprint of the project is also reduced. For more information about our lithium resource and Ogden facility, see Item 2, “Properties—Ogden Facility.”
For phase one of our lithium development project, we are planning to build a battery-grade lithium carbonate facility with an annual capacity of approximately 11,000 metric tons. The facility will be located on the east side of the Great Salt Lake where a significant portion of our existing infrastructure is located. The front-end loaded (“FEL-1”) or Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) capital development cost of phase one is estimated to be approximately $260 million (-30%/+40%) and is currently estimated to yield a net present value in the range of approximately $600 million to $1.0 billion assuming a 34 year-life and sales price estimates in the range of approximately $15,900 per metric ton and $20,700 per metric ton, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, our capital costs related to phase one of the project have been $2.6 million. We are working to complete an FEL-2 project cost estimate (-20%/+25%), comparable to a pre-feasibility study, by the first quarter of calendar year 2023. We believe we are on track to enter the market with a cost-competitive, battery-grade lithium product by 2025.
For phase two of the project, we intend to build an approximately 28,000 metric ton battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate facility. This facility will be located on the west side of the Great Salt Lake and is currently estimated to become operational in 2028.
As discussed in Part II, Item 8, Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Koch Minerals & Trading LLC (“KM&T”), a subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc. (“KII”), invested approximately $252 million for approximately 6.8 million common shares of Compass Minerals stock in a transaction that closed in October 2022. Approximately $200 million of the proceeds are expected to be used to advance the first phase of our lithium development project. We sell SOP to subsidiaries of KII in the normal course of business and have recently engaged a subsidiary of KII to provide engineering services for our lithium development project.
Fortress
In November 2021, we announced a $45 million equity investment in Fortress North America, LLC (“Fortress”), a next-generation fire retardant company dedicated to developing and producing a portfolio of more environmentally friendly fire retardants to combat wildfires. This investment, made in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2022, together with the previous $5 million already invested, increased the Company’s ownership to approximately 45% as part of our strategy to strengthen and grow our essential minerals business.
Fortress’ patented portfolio of long-term fire retardant, aerial and ground retardant formulations has been developed primarily using essential minerals supplied from our Ogden facility. 
Fortress plans to further expand its suite of magnesium chloride-based retardants, which provide unique properties for fighting wildfires and abating fire risk. The investment by Compass Minerals is expected to enable Fortress to scale more quickly by completing the construction of its manufacturing facilities for both its powder and liquid concentrate products. Fortress also expects to leverage Compass Minerals’ supply chain and logistics capabilities in support of Fortress’ market competitiveness.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Monitoring the unauthorized use of our technology is difficult, and we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our technology. The disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our ability to protect our rights and our competitive position (see “Risk Factors—Our intellectual property may be misappropriated or subject to claims of infringement” for more information).
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
As of September 30, 2022, we employed 1,954 employees, of which 997 were located in the U.S., 773 were located in Canada and 184 were located in the U.K. Nearly 50% of our workforce is represented by collective bargaining agreements. Of our 12 collective bargaining agreements in effect on September 30, 2022, six will expire in fiscal 2023, one will expire in fiscal 2024, three will expire in fiscal 2025 (including for our Cote Blanche mine), and one will expire in each of fiscal 2026 (for our Goderich mine) and 2027. 
We believe that our workforce drives the success of our Company and is paramount to creating long-term value. We strive to put our employees first and foster an environment in which their safety, well-being, career progression and sense of belonging are prioritized. By investing in our workforce and culture, we are helping to ensure a strong, sustainable future for our Company.
To help ensure continued focus on our workforce and culture, as well as measure our progress in these areas, our Company announced in fiscal 2022 a set of fiscal 2025 goals and targets, including in the categories of safety, employee development, and diversity and inclusion. 
Environmental, Health and Safety
At Compass Minerals, we prioritize a safe and healthy work environment for all our employees. Our Company is focused on the ultimate goal of zero harm, which includes zero injuries to our employees and contractors. This goal requires the collaboration and participation of all employees, at every site. We measure zero harm by how we are decreasing our total case incident rate (“TCIR”) and improving our environmental compliance-based metrics. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, our TCIR is 1.27. Fiscal 2022 is one of the safest 12-month periods in our Company’s history since we have been tracking TCIR, with a TCIR reduction of approximately 50% compared to the previous 12-month period. TCIR is calculated as the number of reportable incidents per year multiplied by 200,000 hours, divided by exposure hours, using Occupational Safety and Health Administration calculating standards. It is an indicator of the number of incidents per 100 employees per year. 
A key driver of this trajectory has been the implementation of the SafeStart® methodology. Tools introduced through SafeStart training addressing unintentional human error and critical safety habits, which reduce risk and the probability of injury. Additionally, we approach health and safety through the lens of continuous improvement and utilize an environmental, health and safety framework that includes policies, procedures, training and Company standards that go beyond compliance. Each of our operational sites has a safety committee, which includes employees and management, and when applicable, union representation. In addition, our sites form focus groups to engage team members and establish best practices for specific health and safety issues. To keep health and safety top of mind, we also encourage our employees to begin internal meetings with a “safety share,” a safety reminder or a lesson learned. 
While COVID-19 has disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, our Company has continued to produce and safely deliver products as an essential business. To help mitigate potential pandemic-related challenges while ensuring a continued focus on zero harm, our management team continues to monitor developments related to the spread and prevention of COVID-19 in order to take appropriate steps to protect our workforce while reviewing existing business continuity protocols. By encouraging open communication, preemptive safety measures and ongoing employee support, our essential business has experienced limited operational disruptions stemming from the pandemic.

Organizational Health
In fiscal 2022, we continued our work to improve organizational health by emphasizing our nine priority health practices that we identified in fiscal 2020. Through our priority health practices, employees gain a stronger understanding of our Company’s future plans, goals and milestones and how their work contributes to Compass Minerals’ success.
Diversity, Belonging, Inclusion and Equity
At Compass Minerals, we believe that everyone has a voice and every voice matters. We hire, promote and retain people with different backgrounds and experiences, which strengthens our culture and brings a wider range of perspectives to help solve critical issues. Our diversity, belonging, inclusion and equity (“DBIE”) strategy focuses on raising awareness and educating employees, engaging employees in initiatives to create a sense of belonging, and finally, having a positive impact on our organization and in our communities by partnering with external groups working to improve DBIE.
In fiscal 2022, we launched new employee resource groups (“ERGs”) that seek to foster an environment that recognizes, supports, recruits, retains, develops and connects employees sharing a particular characteristic, interest or experience, as well as allies of that group. Additionally, our ERGs demonstrate how inclusion enhances employee engagement, provides a sense of belonging, creates opportunities for development and drives business results. Current ERGs at our Company include Emerging Leaders, Compass Pride for LGBTQ+ employees and allies, Women and Allies, Advanced Career for seasoned employees and allies and Asian Employees and Allies. 
Employee Development 
In fiscal 2022, we continued utilizing Compass Minerals University (“CMU”), an online platform for employee training and development. CMU provides our employees with on‑demand access to more than 500 learning modules on topics ranging from project management to strategic thinking to emotional intelligence. Professional certifications in areas like Six Sigma, information technology and business analysis are also available to employees at no cost. Content is presented in a variety of formats from videos and readings to downloadable templates and work aids for managers to use in team meetings or with direct reports. In addition, there are live virtual trainings and bootcamps our employees can attend. 
Our Company also has other forms of development opportunities for employees, such as trainings on performance mindset, team effectiveness and communication styles, and programs available through our Company’s ERGs such as an employee book club. Several options are available to employees who are looking to increase their knowledge and grow professionally. 
Additionally, employees have opportunities for professional development through strategic partnerships with several outside organizations such as Central Exchange, Society of Women Engineers, and American Royal, as well as through membership in trade groups including The Fertilizer Institute, Essential Minerals Association, U.K. Salt Association and Ontario Mining Association.
Community
Beyond the success of our Company and our people, we are committed to supporting and creating value for our communities. We recognize that in many areas, we play an integral role in providing jobs and fostering local economic growth. On a larger scale, through our products, we support safety, sustainability and addressing food insecurity in communities around the world.
Compass Minerals Cares, our community engagement program, aligns with our Core Purpose to help keep people safe, feed the world and enrich lives, every day. This program focuses on Company giving and employee volunteerism to positively impact the communities where we live and work, and it helps foster a great sense of pride in our employees.
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS 
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Our operations subject us to an evolving set of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations. These EHS laws and regulations regulate, or propose to regulate, the conduct of our mining and production operations, including safety procedures and process safety management; management and handling of raw and in-process materials and finished products; air and water quality impacts from our facilities; emissions of greenhouse gases (including carbon or emissions taxes); management of hazardous and solid wastes; remediation of contamination at our facilities; and post-mining land reclamation. Additional legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon or emissions taxes) are in various phases of consideration and enactment. For further discussion of how EHS laws and regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” 
While a number of our capital projects indirectly result in environmental improvements, we estimate that our fiscal 2022 environmental-specific capital expenditures were $0.4 million. We expect to have approximately $4.1 million of environmental capital expenditures in fiscal 2023. However, future capital expenditures are subject to a number of uncertainties, including changes to environmental laws and regulations, changes to our operations or unforeseen remediation requirements, and these expenditures could exceed our expectations.

COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

As of September 30, 2022, we had recorded $1.8 million of accruals for environmental liabilities. We accrue for environmental liabilities when we believe it is probable that we will be responsible, in whole or in part, for environmental investigation or remediation activities and the expenditures for these activities are reasonably estimable. However, the extent and costs of any environmental investigation or remediation activities are uncertain and difficult to estimate and could exceed our expectations, which could materially affect our financial condition and operating results.
Operating Requirements and Impacts
Our operations require permits for extraction of salt and brine, air emissions, surface water discharges of process material and wastes, waste generation, injection of brine and wastewater in to subsurface wells and other activities. As a result, we hold numerous environmental and mineral extraction permits, water rights and other permits, licenses and approvals from governmental authorities authorizing operations at each of our facilities. These permits, licenses and approvals are typically subject to renewals and reissuances. Expansion of our operations or production capacity, or preservation of existing rights in some cases, is also predicated upon securing any necessary permits, licenses and approvals. The terms and conditions of future EHS laws and regulations, permits, licenses and approvals may be more stringent and may require increased expenditures on our part. In addition, although we do not engage in hydraulic fracturing (commonly known as “fracking”), laws and regulations targeting fracking could lead to increased permit requirements and compliance costs for non-fracking operations, including our Salt operations, which require permitted wastewater disposal wells that sometimes receive fluid waste from fracking operations as well.
Our Cote Blanche mine, an underground salt mine located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, is subject to regulation by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended (the “Mine Act”). MSHA is required to regularly inspect the Cote Blanche mine and issue a citation, or take other enforcement action, if an inspector or authorized representative believes that a violation of the Mine Act or MSHA’s standards or regulations has occurred. As required by MSHA, these operations are regularly inspected by MSHA personnel. See “Mine Safety Disclosures” and Exhibit 95 to this report for information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by SEC rules. The cost of compliance and penalties for violations of the Mine Act have been and could potentially be significant. Our underground salt mines located in Goderich, Ontario, Canada and Winsford, Cheshire, U.K. are subject to similar regulations regarding health and safety, and the cost of compliance with these regulations also have been and are expected to be significant.
We have post-closure reclamation obligations, primarily arising under our mining permits or by agreement. Many of these obligations include requirements to maintain financial surety bonds to fund reclamation and site cleanup following the ultimate closure of our mines or certain other facilities. As a result, we maintain financial surety bonds to satisfy these obligations. 
We are also impacted by the U.S. Clean Air Act (the “Clean Air Act”) and other EHS laws and regulations that regulate air emissions. These regulatory programs may require us to make capital expenditures (for example, by installing expensive emissions abatement equipment), modify our operational practices, obtain additional permits or make other expenditures, which could be significant. 
We endeavor to conduct our operations in compliance with all applicable EHS laws, regulations, permits or approvals. However, because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, violations occur from time to time in our industry, and from time to time we have received notices from governmental agencies that we are not in compliance with certain EHS laws, regulations, permits or approvals and have incurred fines or penalties for these violations. Upon receipt of these notices, we evaluate the matter and take appropriate corrective actions.
Remedial Activities
Many of our past and present facilities have been in operation for decades. Operations at these facilities have historically involved the use and handling of regulated chemical substances, salt, salt byproducts and waste by us and our predecessors.
At many of these facilities, releases and disposal of regulated substances have occurred and could occur in the future, which could require us to investigate, undertake or pay for remediation activities under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and other similar EHS laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may impose “no fault” liability on past and present owners and operators of facilities associated with the release or disposal of hazardous substances, regardless of fault or the legality of the original actions. Additionally, one past or present owner or operator may be required to bear more than its proportional share of liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. 
In addition, third parties have alleged in the past and could allege in the future that our operations have resulted in contamination to neighboring off-site areas or third-party facilities, including third-party disposal facilities for regulated substances generated by our operations, which could result in liability for us under CERCLA or other EHS laws and regulations. 
We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs and liabilities as a result of our current and former operations and our predecessor’s operations. In the past, we have agreed to undertake or pay for investigations to determine whether remediation will be required under CERCLA or otherwise to address any contamination. In other instances, we have agreed to perform remediation activities or have undertaken voluntary remediation to address identified contamination.

Other Regulatory Matters
As a global company, we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations. The most significant government regulations that impact our business, in addition to EHS laws and regulations, operating requirements and remedial activities, are discussed below. For further discussion of how government regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Taxes and Tariffs - We are subject to complex requirements of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to taxation, tariffs and import duties. See Part II, Item 8, Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on taxes.
Import and Export Requirements, Anti-Corruption Laws and Related Matters - We manufacture, market and sell our products both inside and outside the U.S. and ship our products across international borders. As a result, we are required to comply with a number of U.S. and international regulations, which include fair competition (antitrust) laws, import and export requirements, customs laws and anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act and the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, which generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage. 
Employment and Labor Relations - We are also subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing our relationships with our employees, including those relating to wages, overtime, labor matters, working conditions, hiring and firing, non-discrimination, immigration, work permits and employee benefits. 
Impacts of Regulatory Matters
Costs of compliance with laws and regulations, including management effort, time and resources, have been and are expected to continue to be significant. These costs include the capital projects related to environmental improvements discussed above. New or proposed regulatory programs (including EHS regulatory programs), as well as future interpretations and enforcement of existing laws and regulations, may impact our business significantly, our ability to serve customers, preclude us from conducting business with governmental entities, require modification to our facilities, lead to substantial increases in operating costs, penalties, injunctions, civil remedies or fines or cause interruptions, modifications or a termination of operations, the extent to which we cannot predict. Anticipating future compliance obligations, implementing compliance plans and estimating future costs can be particularly challenging while laws and regulations are under development and have not been adopted. For further discussion, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
