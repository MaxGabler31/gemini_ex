Item 1.                               Business
Overview
     We are a clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on developing innovative products at the intersection of drugs and devices that address significant unmet medical needs in the treatment of cardiopulmonary diseases. Our focus is the continued development of our nitric oxide therapy for patients with pulmonary hypertension, or PH, using our proprietary delivery system, INOpulse, with pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, representing the lead indication. Our INOpulse platform is based on our proprietary pulsatile nitric oxide delivery device. 
In February 2016, we announced positive data from the final analysis of our Phase 2 long-term extension clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH, which was Part 2 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH. The data indicates a sustainability of benefit to PAH patients who received INOpulse therapy at the 75 mcg/kg of ideal body weight/hour dose for an average of greater than 12 hours per day and were on long-term oxygen therapy, or LTOT. After reaching an agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, on our Phase 3 protocol, we are moving forward with Phase 3 clinical trial and related development. In September 2015, the FDA completed a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, for our Phase 3 PAH program for INOpulse, and agreed with our proposed clinical protocol, which included two confirmatory clinical trials. The first of the two Phase 3 trials, or INOvation-1, was initiated in June 2016. During January 2017, we received confirmation from the FDA of its acceptance of all of our proposed modifications to our Phase 3 program. Under the modified Phase 3 program, the ongoing INOvation-1 trial, and a second confirmatory randomized withdrawal study with approximately 40 patients who will be crossing over from the INOvation-1 study, may serve as the two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials usually required to support a New Drug Application, or NDA, for INOpulse in PAH patients on LTOT assuming that the associated endpoints are met. Both clinical trials include an interim analysis approximately half-way through each trial to assess for efficacy and futility. The interim analysis for the INOvation-1 trial also includes a potential sample size reassessment. In January 2018, we announced that our INOvation-1 trial enrollment exceeded 100 patients, representing more than half of the anticipated enrollment. 
We completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-confirmation Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PH-COPD) in July 2014. We received results from this trial, and completed further Phase 2 testing to demonstrate the potential benefit on exercise capacity. In September 2015, an oral presentation of late-breaking data from a clinical trial sponsored by us was presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress 2015 in Amsterdam. The data showed that INOpulse improved vasodilation in patients with PH-COPD. In July 2016, the results were published in the International Journal of COPD in an article entitled “Pulmonary vascular effects of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide in COPD patients with pulmonary hypertension.” In September 2017, we disclosed results of our Phase 2 PH-COPD study that was designed to evaluate the acute effects of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide, or iNO, on vasodilation as well as the chronic effect on hemodynamics and exercise tolerance. The results showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful increase in six-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, and a statistically significant and clinically meaningful decrease in systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, or sPAP. The therapy was well tolerated with no related safety concerns. 
We have begun our clinical program in interstitial lung disease, based on feedback from the medical community and the large unmet medical need. During May 2017, we announced completion of our Phase 2 trial using INOpulse therapy to treat Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or PH-IPF. The data showed that INOpulse was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in hemodynamics and exercise capacity in difficult-to-treat PH-IPF patients. The PH-IPF trial was a proof of concept study (n=4) designed to evaluate the ability of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide, or iNO, to provide selective vasodilation as well as to assess the potential for improvement in hemodynamics and exercise capacity in PH-IPF patients. The study met its primary endpoint showing an average of 15.3% increase in blood vessel volume (p<0.001) during acute inhalation of iNO as well as showing a significant association between ventilation and vasodilation, demonstrating the ability of INOpulse to provide selective vasodilation to the better ventilated areas of the lung. The trial also showed consistent benefit in hemodynamics with a clinically meaningful average reduction of 14% in systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, or sPAP, with acute exposure to iNO. An assessment of the chronic effects of iNO on exercise capacity showed an average 75 meter improvement in 6MWD and consistent improvement of approximately 80 m% in composite endpoints of 6MWD and oxygen saturation with four weeks of treatment. The study assessed both the iNO 75 and iNO 30 dose, supporting iNO 30 as a potentially safe and effective dose. During August 2017, we announced FDA acceptance of our investigational new drug application, or IND for our Phase 2b clinical trial, iNO-PF, using INOpulse therapy in a broad population of patients with pulmonary fibrosis, or PF, at both low and intermediate/high risk of PH. In January 2018, we announced the first patient enrollment in our iNO-PF Phase 2b trial.

In addition, other potential indications for our INOpulse platform include: chronic thromboembolic PH, or CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness. 
We have devoted all of our resources to our therapeutic discovery and development efforts, including conducting clinical trials for our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property and the general and administrative support of these operations. We have devoted significant time and resources to developing and optimizing our drug delivery system, INOpulse, which operates through the administration of nitric oxide as brief, controlled pulses that are timed to occur at the beginning of a breath. 

Our Development Program

The following table summarizes key information about INOpulse and indications for which we have worldwide commercialization rights.

From the inception of our business through December 31, 2017, $261.7 million was invested in our development programs. Prior to our February 2015 initial public offering, or IPO, our sole source of funding was investments in us by our former parent company, Ikaria, Inc. (a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt plc), or Ikaria.  As used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “Ikaria” refer to Ikaria, Inc. and its subsidiaries and any successor entity.
INOpulse
Our INOpulse program is an extension of the technology used in hospitals to deliver continuous-flow inhaled nitric oxide. Use of inhaled nitric oxide is approved by the FDA and certain other regulatory authorities to treat persistent PH of the newborn. Ikaria has marketed continuous-flow inhaled nitric oxide as INOmax for hospital use in this indication since FDA approval in 1999. In October 2013, Ikaria transferred to us exclusive worldwide, royalty-free rights to develop and commercialize pulsed nitric oxide in PAH, PH associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or PH-COPD, and PH associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or PH-IPF. In July 2015, we expanded the scope of our license to allow us to develop our INOpulse program for the treatment of chronic thromboembolic PH, or CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness with a royalty equal to 5% of net sales of any commercial products for these three additional indications. In November 2015, we entered into an amendment to our exclusive cross-license, technology transfer and regulatory matters agreement with Ikaria that included a royalty equal to 3% of net sales of any commercial products for PAH. Our INOpulse program is built on scientific and technical expertise developed for the therapeutic delivery of inhaled nitric oxide. In 2010 and 2012, respectively, Ikaria submitted investigational new drug applications, or INDs, for INOpulse for the treatment of patients with PAH and PH-COPD. PAH is a form of PH that is closely related to persistent PH of the newborn. These INDs were included in the assets that were transferred to us by Ikaria.
Nitric oxide is naturally produced and released by the lining of the blood vessels and results in vascular smooth muscle relaxation, an important factor in regulating blood pressure. Relaxation of the muscles of the blood vessels allows the heart to increase blood flow to tissues and organs of the body, including the lung. When administered through inhalation, nitric oxide acts to selectively reduce pulmonary arterial pressure in the lung with minimal effects on blood pressure outside of the lungs, an important safety consideration.
Inhaled nitric oxide is widely used in the hospital setting for the treatment of a variety of conditions and, as reported by Ikaria, over 600,000 patients have been treated with inhaled nitric oxide worldwide since its first such use. However, chronic outpatient use of this therapy has previously been limited by a lack of a safe and compact delivery system for outpatient use. 
5

We have designed our INOpulse device, which is the means by which inhaled nitric oxide is delivered to the patient, to be portable, which enables use by ambulatory patients on a daily basis inside or outside their homes. Our INOpulse device has a proprietary mechanism that delivers brief, targeted pulses of nitric oxide timed to occur at the beginning of a breath for delivery to the well-ventilated alveoli of the lungs, which minimizes the amount of drug required for treatment. We estimate this, and the higher concentration of nitric oxide we use, reduces the volume of drug delivered to approximately 5% of the volume required for equivalent alveolar absorption using standard continuous flow delivery systems, and also reduces the amount of nitric oxide, as well as its by-product nitrogen dioxide, that is exhaled and released into the patient’s environment. INOpulse is designed to automatically adjust nitric oxide delivery based on a patient’s breathing pattern to deliver a constant and appropriate dose of the inhaled nitric oxide over time, independent of the patient’s activity level, thus ensuring more consistent dosing of the nitric oxide to the alveoli of the lungs.
In our previous Phase 2 INOpulse clinical trials, we used the first generation INOpulse device, which we refer to as the INOpulse DS device. Beginning with our Phase 3 trial of INOpulse for PAH in 2016, we have begun using our second generation device, which we refer to as the INOpulse device. The INOpulse device has approximately the same dimensions as a paperback book and weighs approximately 2.5 pounds. The INOpulse device has a simple and intuitive user interface and a battery life of approximately 16 hours when recharged, which takes approximately four hours and can be done while the patient sleeps. Based on the doses we have evaluated in our clinical trials, we expect that most patients will use two cartridges a day. The INOpulse device incorporates our proprietary triple-lumen nasal cannula, safety systems and proprietary software algorithms. The triple-lumen nasal cannula enables more accurate dosing of nitric oxide and minimizes infiltration of oxygen, which can react with nitric oxide to form nitrogen dioxide. Our triple-lumen nasal cannula consists of a thin, plastic tube that is divided into three channels from end-to-end, including at the prongs that are placed in the patient’s nostrils, with one channel delivering inhaled nitric oxide, a second for breath detection and a third available for oxygen delivery. INOpulse is configured to be highly portable and compatible with long-term oxygen therapy, or LTOT, systems via nasal cannula delivery.
The INOpulse device has been well received by patients in the usability research we have conducted. In addition to the baseline testing on the original INOpulse DS device, we have conducted two rounds of testing with COPD and PAH patients to evaluate the user interface, loading mechanism, size, carrying bag and other features. In the usability research we have conducted, all eight patients with experience with the INOpulse DS device responded positively to the INOpulse device, and several of these patients indicated that the ability to take the INOpulse device outside the home would likely reduce concerns with maintaining compliance. We conducted two studies to assess the environmental and the expiratory concentration of nitrogen dioxide associated with use of the INOpulse delivery system. Both studies found that the nitrogen dioxide levels were below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
Our technology is based on patents we have exclusively licensed from Ikaria for the treatment of PAH, PH-COPD, PH-IPF, CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from altitude sickness which, collectively, we refer to as the Bellerophon indications. These include patents with respect to the pulsed delivery of nitric oxide to ensure a consistent dose over time, which expire as late as 2027 in the United States and as late as 2026 in certain other countries, as well as with respect to the special triple-lumen cannula that allows for safer and more accurate dosing of pulsed nitric oxide, which expires in 2033 in the United States and abroad. We have also licensed several other patent applications from Ikaria for certain of the innovations included in the INOpulse device and certain of the resulting patents, if issued, would expire as late as 2030 in the United States. We have also expanded our patent portfolio by filing several Company-owned patent applications relating to the use of nitric oxide that will expire as late as 2038.
During January 2016, the European Patent Office issued a Notice of Intention to Grant a European Patent that provides protection for our INOpulse program. The patent, entitled “System of Administering a Pharmaceutical Gas to a Patient,” covers the ability to provide a known amount of pharmaceutical gas to a patient regardless of the patient inspiration rate or volume and distinguishes the INOpulse® delivery system from others on the market. This patent was granted by the European Patent Office on March 30, 2016, and was subsequently validated in 30 European countries. Also during January 2016, we received European Conformity, or EC, Certification for our proprietary new, INOpulse® drug-device delivery system. This EC Certification grants CE marking on the INOpulse product, which confirms INOpulse compliance with the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environment protection legislation of the European Union. This certification covers the design, development and manufacture of inhaled pulsatile nitric oxide drug delivery systems including our triple-lumen cannula and application software.
INOpulse for PAH

We are developing INOpulse for the treatment of PAH to address a significant and unmet medical need in an orphan disease, which is a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. This program represents a potential first-in-class therapy for this indication. In 2011, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to our nitric oxide program for the treatment of PAH. If a product with an orphan drug designation is the first to receive FDA approval, the FDA will not approve another product for the same indication that uses the same active ingredient for seven years, except in a limited number of specific situations such as another product being shown to be clinically superior.

PAH is characterized by abnormal constriction of the arteries in the lung that increases the blood pressure in the lungs which, in turn, results in abnormal strain on the heart’s right ventricle, eventually leading to heart failure. While prevalence data varies widely, we estimate that there are a total of at least 35,000 patients currently diagnosed with and being treated for PAH in the United States and European Union. Moreover, because PAH is rare and causes varied symptoms, we believe there is significant under-diagnosis of the condition at its early stages. There are several approved therapies for PAH, and we estimate, based on public product sales data, that 2014 combined global sales for these therapies were over $4.6 billion with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 7%. Most PAH patients are treated with multiple medications and many are on supportive therapy. We believe that 40 to 60% of PAH patients are on LTOT. Despite the availability of multiple therapies for this condition, PAH continues to be a life-threatening, progressive disorder. A French registry initiated in 2002 and a U.S. registry initiated in 2006 estimate that the median survival of patients with PAH is three and five years from initial diagnosis, respectively.
We completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH in October 2014, which was Part 1 of the trial. In February 2016, we announced positive data from the final analysis of Part 2 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH. The data reinforced the results from October 2014 and indicated a sustainability of benefit to PAH patients who received INOpulse therapy at the 75 mcg dose for an average of greater than 12 hours per day and were also treated with LTOT. After reaching agreement with the FDA, and the EMA on our Phase 3 protocol, we are moving forward with Phase 3 development. In September 2015, the FDA agreed to a SPA for our Phase 3 PAH program for INOpulse, which will include two confirmatory clinical trials. The INOvation-1 trial has been initiated with the first patient enrolled in June 2016. During January 2017, we received confirmation from the FDA of its acceptance of all modifications proposed by us to our Phase 3 program. Under the newly modified Phase 3 program, the ongoing one-year INOvation-1 study, and a second confirmatory randomized withdrawal study with approximately 40 patients who will be crossing over from the INOvation-1 study, can serve as the two adequate and well-controlled studies to support a NDA filing for INOpulse in PAH subjects on LTOT. Both studies include an interim analysis approximately half-way through each study to assess for efficacy and futility. The interim analysis for the INOvation-1 study also includes a potential sample size reassessment. In January 2018, we announced our INOvation-1 study enrollment exceeded 100 patients, representing more than half of the anticipated enrollment.

INOpulse for PH-COPD

We are also developing INOpulse for the treatment of PH-COPD. COPD is a disease characterized by progressive and persistent airflow limitations. Patients with more severe COPD frequently have hypoxemia, or an abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood, and may be treated with LTOT. Despite treatment with oxygen, hypoxemia can progress and contribute to PH. In 2010, Datamonitor estimated that over 1.4 million COPD patients in the United States were being treated with LTOT. Based on academic studies, we estimate that 50% of COPD patients on LTOT have PH. PH-COPD patients have a lower median life expectancy and a higher rate of hospitalization than COPD patients with similar respiratory disease but without PH. Currently, there are no approved therapies for treating PH-COPD, and the only generally accepted treatments are LTOT, pulmonary rehabilitation and lung transplant. The overall COPD market in the United States was estimated to be approximately $32 billion in 2010 with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 4% (Ford et al., Chest, 2015, Vol 147, pp 31-45).
The data from an initial three-month, open-label chronic-use Phase 2 trial conducted by a third party, which we in-licensed, showed that pulsed inhaled nitric oxide significantly reduced pulmonary arterial pressures in PH-COPD patients on LTOT and did so without causing hypoxemia, which is a significant concern for these patients. The FDA asked us to confirm the dose range and the safety related to hypoxemia in PH-COPD patients using the INOpulse device, prior to proceeding to large scale trials. Following this guidance, we conducted a Phase 2 acute dose ranging randomized placebo-controlled trial in 159 patients with the INOpulse DS device, with doses ranging from 3 mcg to 75 mcg. This trial, which we completed in July 2014, identified a dose range that showed similar reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure versus baseline when compared to the initial acute effects of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide in the original chronic-use trial. In addition, in our confirmatory trial, none of the INOpulse doses tested had an adverse effect on hypoxemia relative to placebo. While the reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure did not reach statistical significance versus placebo in this acute setting, which was the primary endpoint of the trial, we believe that the results have confirmed a dose range for this therapy that delivers a significant reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure versus baseline and does not cause hypoxemia in patients with PH-COPD. In September 2015, an oral presentation of late-breaking data from a clinical trial sponsored by us was presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress 2015 in Amsterdam. The data showed that INOpulse improved vasodilation in patients with PH-COPD. In July 2016, the results were published in the International Journal of COPD in an article titled “Pulmonary vascular effects of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide in COPD patients with pulmonary hypertension”. Building upon this and other work we have done during recent quarters, we have initiated additional Phase 2 testing for the use of the INOpulse device for PH-COPD patients to evaluate the potential benefit of chronic use on exercise capacity, and enrolled the first patient in October 2016.
INOpulse for PH-ILD
7

We are also developing INOpulse for the treatment of PH-ILD. ILD is a general category that includes many different lung conditions.  All ILDs affect the interstitium, a lace-like network of tissue that extends throughout both lungs. ILDs are a chronic progressive disease of destruction of the airways and lung tissue. This results in scarring, thickening of the lung tissue causing insufficient ability for the lungs to oxygenate blood to be delivered to the body, caused by imbalance in mediators and chronic inflammation. While ILD is primarily a respiratory disease, it can also affect the pulmonary blood circulation, resulting in vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. Chronic elevation of the pulmonary artery pressures puts stress on the right ventricle and can lead to right ventricular failure.
One of the largest and most serious subsets of ILDs is IPF, a progressive disease of unknown etiology associated with growth of fibrotic tissue in the lungs causing hypoxemia, dyspnea, fatigue and cough. The median survival is only two to three years. Based on academic studies, we estimate the prevalence of IPF in the United States at approximately 90,000 patients, with 20-40% suffering from pulmonary hypertension. PH with IPF increases mortality. The presence of PH correlates most closely with the need for oxygen therapy. The two therapies that are currently approved for IPF, Nintedanib and Pirfenidone, cost approximately $100,000 per year. 
iNO may improve outcomes in PH-IPF by both improving Ventilation-Perfusion, or V/Q, matching with increases in arterial oxygenation and by lowering pulmonary artery pressures. It has been shown (Yoshida et al., Eur Respir J 1997: 10: 2051-2054) that inhalation of nitric oxide significantly reduced the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and the pulmonary vascular resistance as compared with room air alone. However, the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) did not improve. The combined inhalation of nitric oxide and oxygen produced a significant decrease of pulmonary arterial pressure (p<0.01) as well as an improvement (p<0.05) in PaO2 as compared to oxygen alone. These findings support the potential for the combined use of nitric oxide and oxygen for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients with pulmonary hypertension. 
During May 2017, we announced completion of our Phase 2 clinical trial using INOpulse therapy to treat PH-IPF. The clinical data showed that INOpulse was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in hemodynamics and exercise capacity in difficult-to-treat PH-IPF patients. The PH-IPF trial was a proof of concept study (n=4) designed to evaluate the ability of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide, or iNO, to provide selective vasodilation as well as to assess the potential for improvement in hemodynamics and exercise capacity in PH-IPF patients. The clinical trial met its primary endpoint showing an average of 15.3% increase in blood vessel volume (p<0.001) during acute inhalation of iNO as well as showing a significant association between ventilation and vasodilation, demonstrating the ability of INOpulse to provide selective vasodilation to the better ventilated areas of the lung. The trial showed consistent benefit in hemodynamics with a clinically meaningful average reduction of 14% in systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) with acute exposure to iNO. It also assessed the chronic effects of iNO on exercise capacity showing an average 75 meter improvement in 6MWD, and consistent improvement of approximately 80 m% in composite endpoints of 6MWD and oxygen saturation with four weeks of treatment. The study assessed both the iNO 75 and iNO 30 dose, supporting iNO 30 as a potentially safe dose. During August 2017, we announced FDA acceptance of our IND for our Phase 2b (iNO-PF) clinical trial using INOpulse therapy in a broad population of patients with pulmonary fibrosis, or PF, at both low and intermediate/high risk of PF. PH. In January 2018, we announced the first patient enrollment in our iNO-PF Phase 2b trial.
BCM
In December 2011, we initiated a clinical trial of BCM, which we refer to as our PRESERVATION I trial, and completed enrollment in December 2014. Top-line results from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial were announced in July 2015. Topline results showed no statistically significant treatment differences between patients treated with BCM and patients treated with placebo for both the primary and the secondary endpoints. Following the results, we are considering further exploratory work but we do not intend to proceed with further clinical development of BCM at this point until and unless we can determine an alternative path forward. We continue to maintain the patent portfolio, including the composition of matter and method manufacturing patents that we have in-licensed from BioLineRx Ltd.
Our Strategy

Our goal is to become a leader in developing and commercializing innovative products at the intersection of drugs and devices that address significant unmet medical needs in the treatment of cardiopulmonary diseases. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include:

• | Advance the clinical development of INOpulse. One of our lead indications for our product candidate is INOpulse for PAH. Our Phase 3 PAH program for INOpulse will include two confirmatory clinical trials including the ongoing INOvation-1 trial and a second confirmatory randomized withdrawal study. We also completed Phase 2 studies for INOpulse in PH-COPD looking at the effect of chronic use on exercise capacity and in PH-IPF consisting of an

8

exploratory acute hemodynamic study.


• | Leverage our historical core competencies to expand our pipeline. Our employees have years of institutional experience in the use of inhaled nitric oxide in treating PH and in the development of drug-device combination product candidates. If we successfully advance INOpulse, we expect to develop INOpulse for treatment of CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from altitude sickness and, subject to obtaining additional license rights from Ikaria, potentially other outpatient PH indications. Our longer-term vision is to identify and opportunistically in-license innovative therapies that are at the intersection of drugs and devices and to develop and commercialize these product candidates.


• | Build commercial infrastructure in select markets. As we near completion of the development of our product candidates, we may build a commercial infrastructure to enable us to market and sell certain of our product candidates with a specialized sales force and to retain co-promotion or similar rights, when feasible, in indications requiring a larger commercial infrastructure. While we may partner with third parties to commercialize our product candidates in certain countries, we may also choose to establish commercialization capabilities in select countries outside the United States.


INOpulse

INOpulse Scientific Background

Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring molecule produced by many cells of the body. Researchers found that nitric oxide is produced and released by the lining of the blood vessels and plays a role in controlling muscle tone in blood vessels. In particular, nitric oxide results in vascular smooth muscle relaxation in blood vessels and thus is an important factor in regulating blood pressure. As the muscles of the blood vessels relax, blood flow increases, helping the heart to deliver more blood to the body. PH patients can have a deficiency in endogenous nitric oxide production in their lungs. When administered by inhalation to patients with PH, we expect inhaled nitric oxide to act in a similar manner to naturally produced nitric oxide.
The scientific journal Science named nitric oxide Molecule of the Year in 1992. Additionally, the three researchers who discovered the role of nitric oxide as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system earned the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1998.
In 1991, Dr. Warren Zapol and his associates at the Massachusetts General Hospital discovered that inhaling nitric oxide in gas form could reduce high blood pressure in the lungs, a condition known as PH. Nitric oxide is a rapid and potent vasodilator, which means it dilates, or widens, blood vessels. When inhaled, it quickly dilates blood vessels in the lungs, which reduces blood pressure in the lungs, strain on the right ventricle and shunting of de-oxygenated blood away from the lungs. Because more blood can flow through the lungs, oxygen levels within blood improve. In addition, inhaled nitric oxide improves the efficiency of oxygen delivery, and because it is a gas, it goes only to the portions of the lung that are ventilated, or receiving air flow, and increases blood flow only in these areas. Thus, inhaled nitric oxide improves ventilation-perfusion matching, an important element of lung function involving the air that reaches the lungs, or ventilation, and the blood that reaches the lungs, or perfusion. Inhaled nitric oxide is quickly inactivated after contact with blood, and is selective for the lungs, meaning that it has minimal effects on blood pressure outside of the lungs, which is an important safety consideration.
In 1999, the FDA approved the use of inhaled nitric oxide for the short-term treatment of persistent PH of the newborn. Based on this approval, and similar approvals from foreign regulatory authorities, continuous-flow inhaled nitric oxide, which is administered to ventilated patients by a dedicated in-hospital device, is marketed by Ikaria and its commercialization partners worldwide as INOmax (INOflo in Japan). Inhaled nitric oxide is widely used in the hospital setting for a variety of conditions and, as reported by Ikaria, over 600,000 patients have been treated with inhaled nitric oxide worldwide since its commercial launch. However, chronic outpatient use of this therapy has previously been limited by the lack of a safe and compact delivery system for outpatient use.
Introduction to Pulmonary Hypertension

PH is a disease characterized by constriction of the blood vessels in the lung, which causes blood pressure in the lung to rise and, in turn, increases the work required for the right ventricle of the heart to pump blood. The World Health Organization, or WHO, has endorsed a consensus classification for PH that was updated most recently in 2013. The WHO classification has five broad PH groups based on similarities in pathological and hemodynamic characteristics and therapeutic approaches. We are initially focusing development of INOpulse in indications included in WHO Groups 1 and 3 due to our view of the likelihood of success and the size and commercial viability of these markets. Group 1 PH is comprised of patients 
9

with PAH. This Group combines conditions with a range of causes, all of which have a characteristic pattern of vascular remodeling. The constriction of the blood vessels and the resulting pressure on the heart is often the major reason for poor prognosis of PAH patients since they can be otherwise healthy. Most PAH-specific medications are vasodilators and work through one of the three key mechanistic pathways for vasoconstriction and vasodilation. We expect that, because inhaled nitric oxide is a vasodilator and PH patients can have a deficiency in endogenous nitric oxide production in their lungs, patients in Group 1 will benefit from INOpulse. Group 3 PH consists of PH associated with lung disease or hypoxemia, which is an abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood. This Group includes patients with PH-COPD and PH-IPF, among others.

INOpulse for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

We are developing INOpulse for PAH to address a significant and unmet medical need in an orphan disease. This product candidate represents the development of a potential first-in-class therapy for this indication. Although current therapy for PAH provides some therapeutic benefit, there remains no cure, and approved therapies can have significant systemic side effects, such as hypotension and liver injury. INOpulse for PAH is designed to be a selective, short-acting pulmonary vasodilator and is being tested as an add-on therapy to existing PAH medications to evaluate its efficacy and side effect profile, in particular its ability to provide clinical benefit without adding to the systemic effects of other therapies such as hypotension.
Disease Background and Market Opportunity
PAH is a life-threatening, progressive disorder characterized by abnormally high blood pressure, or hypertension, in the pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. PAH occurs when most of the very small arteries, or arterioles, throughout the lungs narrow in diameter, which increases the resistance to blood flow through the lungs. To overcome the increased resistance, pressure increases in the pulmonary artery and the right ventricle, which is the heart chamber that pumps blood into the pulmonary artery. In addition, PAH may cause changes to the blood vessel lining that hinder the natural production of nitric oxide. Signs and symptoms of PAH occur when this increased pressure in the right ventricle cannot fully overcome the elevated resistance.
There are a number of drugs approved for the treatment of PAH that work primarily by reducing pulmonary vascular resistance, which is the primary problem for these patients. The currently approved PAH medications slow down disease progression, but do not prevent the underlying disease. Despite the availability of multiple therapies for this condition, the mortality rate for PAH remains high, with estimates of median survival ranging from three to five years. Currently, the only definitive treatment for PAH is a lung transplant, which is only available to a minority of patients due to the strict requirements and availability of viable lungs for transplant. Patients with PAH also report severe impairment of health-related quality of life, including poor general and emotional health and impaired physical functioning. The most common symptoms of PAH are shortness of breath during exertion and syncope, or fainting spells. People with PAH may experience additional symptoms, particularly as the condition worsens, including dizziness, swelling of the ankles or legs, chest pain and a racing pulse. These impairments to health-related quality of life are comparable and sometimes more severe than those reported in patients with severely debilitating conditions such as spinal cord injury.
Since PAH is an orphan condition with poor diagnosis rates, published prevalence estimates for PAH vary widely. Based on epidemiological studies and current treatment rates, we estimate that there are a total of at least 35,000 patients currently diagnosed and treated for PAH in the United States and European Union. The average age of PAH patients at diagnosis is approximately 50 years, and approximately 80% of PAH patients are female. PAH is often diagnosed late in the disease progression with approximately 73% of these patients already having progressed to WHO functional Class III or IV at the time of diagnosis.
PAH is characterized by abnormal constriction of the arteries in the lung. PAH patients are generally treated with one or more of the four major classes of approved medications, which are prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogs, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists and a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, all of which potentially result in vasodilatory systemic effects and, therefore, hypotension. Current guidelines recommend treatment with multiple medications in Class III and IV patients with progressive disease but suggest treatment be carefully managed by experienced physicians. Approximately 45% of PAH patients are treated with more than one class of medication at a given time. In addition, since hypoxemia can be a problem in these patients, it is often treated with LTOT in accordance with broadly supported treatment guidelines in the United States and European Union.
We are testing INOpulse for PAH as an add-on therapy for use in patients whose disease is progressing and who use additional medications. If it is approved, we expect INOpulse will provide the greatest benefit to patients who require pulmonary arterial pressure reductions beyond the reductions achieved with the medication they are already using. Because of its localized effect and short-half life, we do not expect INOpulse will add to systemic blood pressure reductions of other PAH drugs. We believe that INOpulse is also likely to be preferentially prescribed for patients already on LTOT. Data from the 
10

REVEAL registry, a registry study of PAH based in the United States, indicate that approximately 40% of patients are treated with oxygen for hypoxemia. A more recent assessment of the use of oxygen in the REVEAL registry found that 57% of PAH patients were on LTOT. Approximately 60% of the patients from Part 1 of our Phase 2 clinical trial completed in October 2014 were on LTOT. We believe that, as compared to patients who are not using a nasal cannula, patients who are accustomed to using a nasal cannula for delivery of oxygen are more likely to be prescribed and are more likely to be compliant with the use of INOpulse.
A 2013 report by CVS Caremark Specialty Analytics provided examples of PAH medications with annual prices ranging from approximately $100,000 to $150,000 per patient per year in the United States. We expect that, if approved, the price of INOpulse will be in the range of other established PAH medications.

Scientific Rationale for Use of INOpulse for PAH

Since the discovery of the significant role of nitric oxide in vasodilation, there has been an expectation in the scientific community that inhaled nitric oxide could be an effective therapy for PAH. According to the Cleveland Clinic Center for Continuing Education section on Pulmonary Hypertension, exogenous administration of nitric oxide by inhalation is probably the most effective and specific therapy for PAH, but cost and technical complexity of delivering inhaled nitric oxide have limited its use to the hospital. Although not approved for the treatment of PAH, data from an in-hospital survey conducted by Ikaria showed an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 INOmax uses in PAH patients in the United States each year, indicating that physicians already use nitric oxide in some PAH patients. The difficulty in delivering inhaled nitric oxide outside of the hospital results from the size of the device and cylinder and the need for a specialized delivery system with built-in safety systems.
We are developing nitric oxide for treatment of PAH because nitric oxide is a proven vasodilator, and PAH is primarily a disease of high pulmonary vascular resistance. PAH is associated with impaired release of nitric oxide and thus we believe chronic administration of inhaled nitric oxide may be viewed as an adjunctive or replacement therapy in patients with PAH. The use of inhaled nitric oxide in PAH has been proposed since the role of nitric oxide in this disease was identified. This drug has been tested in limited investigational studies conducted at academic institutions.
One clinical trial conducted by a third party at an academic center in Spain in 11 patients, seven of whom had severe PAH and four of whom had severe chronic thromboembolic PH, or CTEPH, evaluated the use of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide in an ambulatory setting. In this open-label, single-arm trial with no placebo control, patients were given ambulatory pulsed inhaled nitric oxide therapy via a nasal cannula for up to one year, after being withdrawn from PAH-specific therapy. The nitric oxide pulse was delivered to the patient at the beginning of each inspiration at a flow rate that was individualized for such patient. The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with inhaled nitric oxide outside the hospital setting.
At the start of this trial, patients were evaluated for various measures including the distance they were able to walk in six minutes and their WHO functional class status. At baseline, most of these patients had significant impairment of six-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, with the ability to walk an average of 125 meters, and poor WHO functional class status, with nine patients in Class IV and two patients in Class III. After one month of therapy, overall, patients improved based on WHO functional class, with six patients in Class III and five in Class II, and had improvements in 6MWD of 128 meters on average. After six months of treatment, patients did not worsen clinically, however, between months six and 12, seven patients were given a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor due to clinical worsening. One patient who initially did well with the added phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor therapy developed severe right heart failure at month eight and died, and another patient received a lung transplant at month nine. The remaining nine patients all had clinical status at month 12 similar to their one month evaluation, and improvements in functional class and 6MWD for the group persisted over time.
We do not expect INOpulse to have systemic effects beyond the pulmonary vasculature because of the short half-life of nitric oxide combined with its targeted delivery to the alveoli. When nitric oxide is delivered as a pulse at the beginning of inhalation, it travels to the alveoli where it diffuses rapidly across the alveolar capillary membrane into the adjacent vascular smooth muscle of pulmonary vessels. This transport is similar to the natural transport of endogenous nitric oxide from the endothelial cells, where it is produced, to the vascular smooth muscle cells where it relaxes the muscle and causes vasodilation of the pulmonary arteries. We believe this makes INOpulse unlikely to have intolerable side effects, such as systemic hypotension or drug-drug interactions. Given the need for PAH patients to be treated with multiple therapies and the potential for increased hypotension from each of the currently approved PAH therapies, we are developing INOpulse as an add-on or adjunctive therapy for PAH, where we believe it has the highest commercial potential.
Clinical Development Program

INOpulse for PAH is designated as a drug-device combination by the FDA and is subject to review by the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research with consultation from the Center for 
11

Devices and Radiological Health. Based upon our IND for PAH, the FDA has agreed that no further preclinical studies are required for clinical development of INOpulse for PAH.
Phase 2 Clinical Trial

In October 2014, we completed Part 1 of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH in the United States and Canada. Our key inclusion criteria for patients in this trial were that they be diagnosed with PH WHO Group 1, be on at least one other PAH medication for at least 12 weeks prior to treatment with INOpulse; and demonstrate being able to walk between 100 and 450 meters within six minutes. In addition, this trial excluded patients with evidence of significant left ventricular dysfunction.
The trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial with patients randomized 1:1:1 to placebo or to one of two active doses, either 25 or 75 mcg/kg ideal body weight/hour, (iNO 25 or iNO 75), for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint in this trial was a change in pulmonary vascular resistance from baseline to 16 weeks, which was the end of Part 1. The target change in pulmonary vascular resistance was 190 dynes sec. cm-5, and the trial was powered for statistical significance at 130 dynes sec. cm-5. The main secondary endpoint was change in 6MWD over the same period. A clinically meaningful change in 6MWD is typically considered to be an increase of at least 30 to 35 meters.
We randomized 80 patients for Part 1 of the Phase 2 clinical trial. The majority of the patients were female (79%), white (89%) and had idiopathic PAH (74%). The results from Part 1 of this trial, showed a trend toward lower pulmonary vascular resistance in both the active arms compared to placebo and a trend toward increased 6MWD in the higher dose group. However, neither result was statistically significant.
However, among LTOT users, there was a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement versus placebo in both pulmonary vascular resistance and 6MWD in patients on the iNO75 dose.
The Part 1 data analysis showed the following:
•Patients on LTOT in the iNO 75 dose treatment arm who remained on INOpulse therapy for at least 12 hours a day had a mean improvement of 52.4 meters as compared to baseline (n=13).
•Patients on LTOT in the iNO 75 dose treatment arm who remained on INOpulse therapy for less than 12 hours a day showed a mean decrease of 10.7 meters as compared to baseline (n=5).
•Patients on LTOT in the iNO 25 dose treatment arm had a mean increase of 9.1 meters from baseline (n=15).
•Patients on LTOT in the Placebo arm had a mean decrease of 10.7 meters from baseline (n=10).
The patients on LTOT in the iNO 75 dose treatment arm who remained on the INOpulse therapy for at least 12 hours a day had a placebo corrected increase of 69.6 meters (increase of 52.4 meters for iNO 75 against a decrease of 17.2 meters for the corresponding placebo arm).
INOpulse was relatively well-tolerated in Part 1 of this trial. Our Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board evaluated the safety analysis from Part 1 of the trial in November 2014 and recommended proceeding with Part 2 of the trial. Possibly drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, occurred in no patients in the placebo group and one subject in each of the iNO25 and iNO75 groups.
One patient in the placebo arm died during Part 1 of the trial due to worsening PAH. SAEs were reported for four patients in the placebo arm, including one each of: pneumonia/worsening PAH, catheter-related infection, ascites and left hip sciatica. Each of these was assessed by the investigator for the trial as unrelated. Four patients in the iNO25 low-dose active treatment arm experienced SAEs, including bacteremia, myelodysplastic syndrome, increased shortness of breath and dyspnea, one of which was assessed as possibly related to trial therapy. The iNO75 high-dose active treatment arm had nine patients with SAEs. The most common SAEs reported in the iNO75 group were syncope and bronchitis/tracheobronchitis, one of which was assessed as possibly related to trial therapy. Discontinuation of trial therapy due to adverse events, or AEs, occurred for two patients in the iNO75 arm and one subject in each of the iNO25 and placebo arms.
In February 2016, we announced positive data from the final analysis of our Phase 2 long-term extension clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH, which was Part 2 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH. The data reinforced the results from October 2014 and indicated a sustainability of benefit to PAH patients who received iNO75 dose therapy for an average of greater than 12 hours per day and were also treated with LTOT.
Following 16 weeks of blinded therapy in Part 1 of the trial, in Part 2 of the trial, 65 patients were randomized to receive INOpulse doses of either iNO25 or iNO75. The long-term extension analysis was performed after patients had completed between 16 and 32 months of INOpulse treatment, and data from the long-term extension analysis was compared to 
12

baseline measurements taken at the beginning of Part 1 of the trial. All patients in the trial were on at least one approved PAH therapy, and most were on two or three PAH therapies.
The long-term extension analysis showed the following:

• | Patients on LTOT in the iNO 75 dose treatment arm who remained on INOpulse therapy for at least 12 hours a day had a mean improvement of 55.2 meters as compared to baseline (n=7).


• | Patients on LTOT in the iNO 75 dose treatment arm who remained on INOpulse therapy for less than 12 hours a day showed a mean decrease of 18.0 meters as compared to baseline (n=6).


• | Patients on LTOT in the iNO 25 dose treatment arm had a mean decrease of 43.7 meters from baseline (n=12).

For patients in the long-term extension study, no significant safety issues have been found with no reports of methemoglobin elevation and no adjudicated cases of pulmonary rebound. Only two SAEs have been reported as possibly related, with these subjects continuing on iNO therapy.
Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trials 
After reaching agreement with the FDA and EMA on our Phase 3 protocol, we are moving forward with our Phase 3 development program. In September 2015, the FDA issued a SPA for our Phase 3 PAH program for INOpulse, which will include two confirmatory clinical trials. The INOvation-1 trial has been initiated with the first patient enrolled in June 2016. During January 2017, we received confirmation from the FDA of its acceptance of all modifications proposed by us to our Phase 3 program. Under the newly modified Phase 3 program, the ongoing one-year INOvation-1 study, and a second confirmatory randomized withdrawal study with approximately 40 patients who will be crossing over from the INOvation-1 study, can serve as the two adequate and well-controlled studies to support a NDA filing for INOpulse in PAH subjects on LTOT. 
The original Phase 3 program called for two studies, the INOvation-1 study (n=188; placebo arm and iNO 75 arm), followed by the INOvation-2 study (n=282; placebo arm, iNO 50 arm and iNO 75 arm). With the approved modifications to the Phase 3 program, the INOvation-2 study will be replaced with the randomized withdrawal study, a much smaller study in approximately 40 subjects over a four-month enrichment period and two month randomized withdrawal. 
In the modified Phase 3 program, following completion of INOvation-1, subjects will receive at least four months of active, open-label iNO treatment with a dose of 75 mcg/kg IBW/hr (iNO75). Those subjects who demonstrate ≥ 30 meter improvement in 6MWD, the primary endpoint of INOvation-1, and can tolerate the iNO, will constitute an “enriched” population of iNO responders who will be randomized to either placebo or iNO75 in the withdrawal study. Changes in clinical status (defined as clinical worsening) within an individual patient during the randomized withdrawal period will provide the necessary evidence of whether the improvements observed during the enrichment phase were related or non-related to iNO therapy. The proposed study design, therefore, provides the formal confirmatory evidence of whether iNO at a dose of 75 mcg/kg IBW/hr delivered via the INOpulse delivery device for up to 24 hours per day is efficacious in subjects with PAH concomitantly using approved PAH medication and LTOT. 
Both studies include an interim analysis approximately half-way through each study to assess for efficacy and futility. The interim analysis for the INOvation-1 study also includes a potential sample size reassessment. In January 2018, we announced our INOvation-1 study enrollment exceeded 100 patients, representing more than half of the anticipated enrollment.

INOpulse for PH-COPD
 We are developing INOpulse for PH-COPD to address a significant unmet medical need that we believe is often overlooked in everyday clinical practice because of the lack of available therapy. PH is more prevalent among those COPD patients who have advanced loss of respiratory function and low peripheral blood oxygen levels requiring treatment with LTOT. The co-morbidity of PH in these patients leads to cardiovascular complications from the added strain on the right ventricle of the heart. Current drug therapies for COPD are targeted to relieve the symptoms and complications of the respiratory component of the disease. Unlike these therapies, INOpulse is directed at treating the cardiovascular complications of PH-COPD. We believe PH-COPD patients on LTOT who are at risk for cardiovascular complications could benefit from use of INOpulse in addition to any respiratory benefits that result from their existing treatments.
Disease Background and Market Opportunity
COPD is a progressive disease caused by chronic inflammation and destruction of the airways and lung tissue. While COPD is primarily a respiratory disease, over time, as the disease progresses, the chronic pulmonary restrictions and resulting deprivation of adequate oxygen, or hypoxia, can contribute to vasoconstriction in the pulmonary arterial bed. In addition, 
13

COPD patients can have deficiency in endogenous nitric oxide production in their lungs, which can worsen vasoconstriction. This pulmonary vasoconstriction puts pressure on the right side of the heart, making it less able to cope with stressors and potentially leading to progressive cardiac dilation, heart failure and death. This cardiovascular component of COPD is, we believe, often overlooked despite pulmonologists’ general awareness of the problem, in part because there are no specific therapies for the condition in these patients. While it is widely believed that the cardiovascular complications of COPD occur only in the advanced stage of the disease as a consequence of chronic hypoxemia, recent findings demonstrate an earlier involvement of the cardiovascular system in this disease.
In 2010, Datamonitor estimated that approximately 12 million patients in the United States were being treated for COPD and that over 1.4 million of these patients were being treated with LTOT. Based on academic studies, we estimate that 50% of COPD patients on LTOT in the United States have PH. Even though the degree of PH in these patients is milder than in PAH patients, data published in literature suggests that even small elevations in mean pulmonary artery pressure in patients with advanced COPD can impact hospitalization, patient-assessed functional outcomes and mortality. PH is a well-known predictor of increased morbidity and mortality in COPD patients and is associated with poor quality of life, worse clinical outcomes and shorter survival time. Based on a long-term study completed in 1992 and published in 1995, PH-COPD patients had a four-year survival rate of approximately 50%. By contrast, in this same long-term study, COPD patients with similar pulmonary functions, but without PH, had a four-year survival rate of 80%.
The overall COPD market in the United States was estimated to be approximately $32 billion in 2010 with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 4%. We expect INOpulse for PH-COPD, if approved, would be a treated as a specialty drug. Specialty drugs are typically high-cost medications, often ranging in price in the United States from approximately $15,000 to $50,000 per patient per year, used to treat rare or complex conditions, requiring close clinical management, special handling and distribution through specialty pharmacies.
Scientific Rationale for Use of INOpulse for PH-COPD
 The mechanism of action of inhaled nitric oxide in vasodilation at the alveolar smooth muscle in PH-COPD is similar to its action in PAH. Like endogenous pulmonary nitric oxide, inhaled nitric oxide works by selectively relaxing lung vascular smooth muscles, causing dilation of pulmonary blood vessels and consequently increased pulmonary blood flow. This reduces the elevated pulmonary artery pressure in patients with PH-COPD.
PH-COPD patients generally have hypoxemia as a result of deteriorating lung function, which can be treated with supplemental oxygen therapy. However, these patients are not treated with currently approved PAH-specific drugs because these drugs can worsen hypoxemia. This worsening can occur when these drugs, which are systemically bioavailable, cause indiscriminate pulmonary vasodilation, even in poorly ventilated alveoli, resulting in lower average blood oxygenation levels. We believe that pulsed nitric oxide, as a locally active selective pulmonary vasodilator, can avoid the indiscriminate vasodilation associated with drugs that are systemically bioavailable. The INOpulse technology, by targeting the delivery of the pulse to the well ventilated alveoli, has the potential to drop pulmonary arterial pressure while avoiding the lowering of blood oxygen levels.
The targeted delivery of inhaled nitric oxide to specific alveoli is important because early trials with continuous-flow inhaled nitric oxide reduced pulmonary arterial pressure in PH-COPD patients but also resulted in lowering of blood oxygen levels. It was postulated that this unwanted effect might be avoided by administering nitric oxide as a brief pulse at the beginning of each breath because well-ventilated alveoli open faster, and a brief early pulse would only reach these alveoli. As early as 1997, this concept was demonstrated by testing inhaled nitric oxide in PH-COPD patients during exercise, which allowed the dose to mimic pulse dosing. Recently, data from a computational fluid-flow modeling study we conducted, using high resolution computed tomography scans and computer simulations, supported this hypothesis that early pulsed delivery of nitric oxide could be directed specifically to the well-ventilated alveoli.

Clinical Development Program
 INOpulse for PH-COPD is designated as a drug-device combination by the FDA and is being reviewed by the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research with consultation from the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Rheumatology Products and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. In our IND for PH-COPD, we referenced all of the information in our IND for PAH. The data referenced in our IND, as well as the years of use of the marketed product, demonstrate that nitric oxide is well tolerated. The FDA has agreed that the IND package is adequate for supporting Phase 2 clinical development of INOpulse for PH-COPD. The FDA also agreed that no additional pre-clinical studies are needed to support product approval.
We completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-confirmation Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PH-COPD in July 2014. We have received results from this trial, and have initiated further Phase 2 testing to demonstrate the potential benefit on exercise capacity. In September 2015, an oral presentation of late-breaking data from a clinical trial 
14

sponsored by us was presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress 2015 in Amsterdam. The data showed that INOpulse improved vasodilation in patients with PH-COPD. In July 2016, the results were published in the International Journal of COPD in an article titled “Pulmonary vascular effects of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide in COPD patients with pulmonary hypertension”. Building upon this and other work we have done over recent quarters, we have initiated additional Phase 2 testing for the use of the INOpulse device for PH-COPD patients to evaluate the potential benefit of chronic use on exercise capacity, with the first patient enrolled in October 2016.
The initiated Phase 2 study in PH-COPD is an open-label study looking at both vasodilation and exercise capacity on ten COPD patients with pulmonary hypertension who are also on long-term oxygen therapy. The key elements of the study are:

• | iNO 30 mcg/kg IBW/hr dose for four weeks with a follow-up visit two weeks after discontinuation;


• | All patients in the trials will be on LTOT;


• | The primary endpoint is vasodilation in pulmonary arteries measured by high resolution CT scanning (HRCT);


• | Key secondary endpoint is 6MWD; and


• | HRCT will be done at baseline and end of four weeks with 6MWT performed at baseline, two weeks, four weeks and six weeks (two weeks after discontinuation of therapy).

INOpulse for PH-ILD
We are also developing INOpulse for the treatment of PH-ILD. ILD is a general category that includes many different lung conditions.  All ILDs affect the interstitium, a lace-like network of tissue that extends throughout both lungs. ILDs are a chronic progressive disease of destruction of the airways and lung tissue. This results in scarring, thickening of the lung tissue causing insufficient ability for the lungs to oxygenate blood to be delivered to the body, caused by imbalance in mediators and chronic inflammation. While ILD is primarily a respiratory disease, it can also affect the pulmonary blood circulation, resulting in vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. Chronic elevation of the pulmonary artery pressures puts stress on the right ventricle and can lead to right ventricular failure.
One of the largest and most serious subset of ILDs is IPF, a progressive disease of unknown etiology associated with growth of fibrotic tissue in the lungs causing hypoxemia, dyspnea, fatigue and cough. The median survival is only two to three years. Based on academic studies, we estimate the prevalence of IPF in the United States at approximately 90,000 patients, with 20-40% suffering from pulmonary hypertension. PH with IPF increases mortality. The presence of PH correlates most closely with the need for oxygen therapy. While there are two recently approved treatments for IPF, there are currently no approved therapies for PH-IPF. The two therapies that are currently approved for IPF, Nintedanib and Pirfenidone cost approximately $100,000 per year.
iNO may improve outcomes in PH-ILD including PH-IPF by both improving V/Q matching with increases in arterial oxygenation and by lowering pulmonary artery pressures. It has been shown (Yoshida et al) that inhalation of nitric oxide significantly reduced the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and the pulmonary vascular resistance as compared with room air alone. However, the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) did not improve. The combined inhalation of nitric oxide and oxygen produced a significant decrease of pulmonary arterial pressure (p<0.01) as well as an improvement (p<0.05) in PaO2 as compared to oxygen alone. These findings support the potential for the combined use of nitric oxide and oxygen for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients with pulmonary hypertension.
Clinical Development Program
During May 2017, we announced completion of our Phase 2 trial using INOpulse therapy to treat PH associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or PH-IPF. The clinical data showed that INOpulse was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in hemodynamics and exercise capacity in difficult-to-treat PH-IPF patients. The PH-IPF trial was a proof of concept study (n=4) designed to evaluate the ability of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide, or iNO, to provide selective vasodilation as well as to assess the potential for improvement in hemodynamics and exercise capacity in PH-IPF patients. The trial met its primary endpoint showing an average of 15.3% increase in blood vessel volume (p<0.001) during acute inhalation of iNO as well as showing a significant association between ventilation and vasodilation, demonstrating the ability of INOpulse to provide selective vasodilation to the better ventilated areas of the lung. The trial showed consistent benefit in hemodynamics with a clinically meaningful average reduction of 14% in systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, or sPAP, with acute exposure to iNO. It also assessed the chronic effects of iNO on exercise capacity showing an average 75 meter improvement in 6MWD and consistent improvement of approximately 80m in composite endpoints of 6MWD and oxygen saturation with four weeks of treatment. The trial assessed both the iNO 75 and iNO 30 dose, supporting iNO 30 as a potentially safe dose. During August 
15

2017, we announced FDA acceptance of our IND for our Phase 2b, iNO-PF, clinical trial using INOpulse therapy in a broad population of patients with pulmonary fibrosis, or PF, at both low and intermediate/high risk with and without PH. In January 2018 we announced the first patient enrollment in our iNO-PF Phase 2b trial in patients with PH associated with Interstitial Lung Disease, or PH-ILD.
 
INOpulse for Other Pulmonary Hypertension Conditions
 PH disease is often classified according to the WHO classification system which groups patients with PH according to the underlying etiologies, or causes, of the PH. In this system, PAH is defined as Group 1 and PH-COPD and PH-ILD are classified under Group 3, PH due to lung disease and/or hypoxemia. We believe the mechanism of action of inhaled nitric oxide as a pulmonary vasodilator, and thus INOpulse, can be effective in treating PH related to other conditions, including CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness.
In 2013, riociguat (Adempas) was the first drug therapy approved for treating CTEPH, although other PAH medications are sometimes used to treat this condition. Patients with sarcoidosis are often treated with steroids or other anti-inflammatory medications, however, there are no therapies approved to treat the PH associated with this disease. Pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness is typically treated with oxygen therapy, however, there are no current treatments for PH associated with this disease.
Our current license from Ikaria covers the development of the Bellerophon indications as noted above.
BCM
In December 2011, we initiated a clinical trial of BCM, which we refer to as our PRESERVATION I trial, and completed enrollment in December 2014. Top-line results from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial were announced in July 2015. Topline results showed no statistically significant treatment differences between patients treated with BCM and patients treated with placebo for both the primary and the secondary endpoints. Following the results, we are considering further exploratory work but we do not intend to proceed with further clinical development of BCM at this point until and unless we can determine an alternative path forward. We continue to maintain the patent portfolio, including the composition of matter and method manufacturing patents that we have in-licensed from BioLineRx Ltd. 
Relationship with Ikaria after the Spin-Out
The development of our programs was initiated under the leadership of our scientific and development team while at Ikaria. Ikaria’s lead product, INOmax, is an inhaled nitric oxide product used for treatment of persistent PH of the newborn. Our understanding of the medical applications of nitric oxide and associated delivery devices, as well as our innovative approach to the pulsed delivery of nitric oxide, originated at Ikaria.
In October 2013, Ikaria completed an internal reorganization of certain assets and subsidiaries, in which it transferred to us exclusive worldwide royalty-free rights to develop and commercialize pulsed nitric oxide in PAH, PH-COPD and PH-IPF. In November 2015, we entered into an amendment to our exclusive cross-license, technology transfer and regulatory matters agreement with Ikaria that included a royalty equal to 3% of net sales of any commercial products for PAH. Following the internal reorganization, in February 2014, Ikaria distributed all of our then outstanding units to its stockholders through the payment of a special dividend on a pro rata basis based on each stockholder’s ownership of Ikaria capital stock. We refer to Ikaria’s distribution of our then outstanding units to its stockholders as the Spin-Out.
Shortly after the Spin-Out, Ikaria was acquired by entities affiliated with Madison Dearborn Partners. On April 16, 2015, Mallinckrodt plc, or Mallinckrodt, announced that it had completed its acquisition of Ikaria.
In connection with the Spin-Out, we entered into several agreements with Ikaria providing for, among other things, the provision of transition services, the cross license of certain intellectual property, commitments not to compete, the manufacture and supply of the INOpulse drug and device and certain employee matters.
 Transition Services Agreement and 2015 Services Agreement
In February 2014 and July 2015, we entered into a transition services agreement and an amendment to the transition services agreement, respectively, with Ikaria, which we refer to as the TSA. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the TSA, Ikaria had agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide certain services to us until February 2016. In exchange for the services provided by Ikaria pursuant to the TSA, we paid to Ikaria a service fee in the amount of $772,000 per month and reimbursed Ikaria for any out of pocket expenses and any taxes imposed on Ikaria in connection with the provision of services 
16

under the TSA. The termination of these services was accelerated to September 30, 2015 as part of the amendment to the agreement entered in July 2015.
Under our additional services agreement with Ikaria, or the 2015 Services Agreement, which became effective on January 1, 2015, Ikaria provided to us certain information technology and device servicing services. In exchange for the services provided by Ikaria pursuant to the 2015 Services Agreement, we paid to Ikaria fees that totaled, in the aggregate, approximately $0.2 million. We also received payments of $1.7 million from Ikaria in connection with the 2015 Services Agreement for using commercially reasonable efforts to provide certain services to Ikaria, including services related to regulatory matters, drug and device safety, clinical operations, biometrics and scientific affairs. In July 2015, we entered into an amendment to the 2015 Services Agreement advancing the termination date from February 8, 2016 to September 30, 2015.
Exclusive Cross-License, Technology Transfer and Regulatory Matters Agreement

In February 2014, we entered into an exclusive cross-license, technology transfer and regulatory matters agreement with Ikaria. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, Ikaria granted to us a fully paid-up, non-royalty bearing, exclusive license under specified intellectual property rights controlled by Ikaria to engage in the development, manufacture and commercialization of nitric oxide, devices to deliver nitric oxide and related services for or in connection with out-patient, chronic treatment of patients with PAH, PH-COPD or PH-IPF. In July 2015, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement to expand the scope of our license to allow us to develop our INOpulse program for the treatment of three additional indications: CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness. Subject to the terms set forth therein, the amendment to the license agreement also provides that the Company will pay Ikaria a royalty equal to 5% of net sales of any commercialized products for the three additional indications. In November 2015, we entered into an amendment to our exclusive cross-license, technology transfer and regulatory matters agreement with Ikaria that included a royalty equal to 3% of net sales of any commercial products for PAH.
We have granted to Ikaria a fully paid-up, non-royalty-bearing, exclusive license under specified intellectual property rights that we control to engage in the development, manufacture and commercialization of products and services for or used in connection with the diagnosis, prevention or treatment, whether in- or out-patient, of certain conditions and diseases other than the Bellerophon indications and for the use of nitric oxide to treat or prevent conditions that are primarily managed in the hospital, which we refer to collectively as the Ikaria nitric oxide business.
We have agreed that, during the term of the license agreement, we will not, without the prior written consent of Ikaria, grant a sublicense under any of the intellectual property licensed to us under the license agreement to any of our affiliates or any third party, in either case that directly or indirectly competes with the Ikaria nitric oxide business. We have also agreed that we will include certain restrictions in our agreements with customers of our products to ensure that such products will only be used for the Bellerophon indications.
The license agreement will expire on a product-by-product basis for products for a specific Bellerophon indication at such time as we are no longer developing or commercializing any product for such indication. The license agreement may be terminated by either party in the event an act or order of a court or governmental authority prohibits either party from substantially performing under the license agreement. Either party may also terminate the license agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event the other party is insolvent or in bankruptcy proceedings. Ikaria may also terminate the license agreement if we or any of our affiliates breach the agreements not to compete described below, or if we or any successor to our rights under the license agreement markets a generic nitric oxide product that is competitive with INOmax. Under certain circumstances, if the license agreement is terminated, the licenses granted to Ikaria by us will survive such termination.
Ikaria retains the right to develop and commercialize inhaled nitric oxide products, including pulsed products, in all indications other than the Bellerophon indications.

Agreements Not to Compete

In September 2013, October 2013 and February 2014, we and each of our subsidiaries entered into an agreement not to compete with Ikaria, each of which was amended in July 2015. We refer to these agreements collectively as the agreements not to compete. Pursuant to the agreements not to compete, as amended, we and each of our subsidiaries agreed not to engage, anywhere in the world, in any manner, directly or indirectly, until the earlier of five years after the effective date of such agreement not to compete, as amended, or the date on which Ikaria and all of its subsidiaries are no longer engaged in such business, in:
•the development, manufacture, commercialization, promotion, sale, import, export, servicing, repair, training, storage, 
17

distribution, transportation, licensing or other handling or disposition of any product or service (including, without limitation, any product or service that utilizes, contains or includes nitric oxide for inhalation, a device intended to deliver nitric oxide or a service that delivers or supports the delivery of nitric oxide), bundled or unbundled, for or used in connection with (a) the diagnosis, prevention or treatment, in both adult and/or pediatric populations, and whether in- or out-patient, of: (i) hypoxic respiratory failure associated with pulmonary hypertension, (ii) pulmonary hypertensive episodes and right heart failure associated with cardiovascular surgery, (iii) bronchopulmonary dysplasia, (iv) the management of ventilation-perfusion mismatch in acute lung injury, (v) the management of ventilation-perfusion mismatch in acute respiratory distress syndrome, (vi) the management of pulmonary hypertension episodes and right heart failure in congestive heart failure, (vii) the management of pulmonary hypertension episodes and right heart failure in pulmonary or cardiac surgery, (viii) the management of pulmonary hypertension episodes and right heart failure in organ transplant, (ix) sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis, (x) hypoxia associated with pneumonia or (xi) ischemia-reperfusion injury or (b) the use of nitric oxide to treat or prevent conditions that are primarily managed in the hospital; or
•any and all development, manufacture, commercialization, promotion, sale, import, export, storage, distribution, transportation, licensing, or other handling or disposition of any terlipressin or any other product within the pressin family, (a) intended to treat (i) hepatorenal syndrome in any form, (ii) bleeding esophageal varices or (iii) septic shock or (b) for or in connection with the management of low blood pressure.
The agreements not to compete expressly exclude the Bellerophon indications.
In February 2014, we also entered into drug and device clinical supply agreements and an employee matters agreement with Ikaria. In November 2015, we entered into an amendment to the drug supply agreement. See “Manufacturing” below for a description of the drug and device clinical supply agreements and “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions-Relationship with Ikaria” for a description of the employee matters agreement.

Manufacturing

INOpulse Drug Product

In February 2014, we and a subsidiary of Ikaria entered into a drug supply agreement which was subsequently amended in November 2015. Under this agreement, Ikaria has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply inhaled nitric oxide for us in our clinical trials, and we have agreed to purchase our clinical supply of inhaled nitric oxide from Ikaria. We have also granted Ikaria a right of first negotiation in the event that we desire to enter into a commercial supply agreement with a third party for supply of nitric oxide for inhalation. The drug supply agreement will expire on a product-by-product basis on the date we discontinue clinical development of such product. In addition, either party may terminate the drug supply agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party.

Ikaria manufactures pharmaceutical-grade nitric oxide at its facility in Port Allen, Louisiana. This facility, which we believe is operated in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, is the only FDA-approved site for manufacturing medical nitric oxide in the world.

To support business outside of the United States, the Port Allen manufacturing facility has also successfully passed inspections by the EMA, Health Canada; the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, of Japan, and the Korean FDA, or KFDA. The EMA, the Health Protection Branch of Health Canada, PMDA and KFDA operate in a similar fashion to the FDA in that each requires submission of a dossier containing substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness prior to approval. These agencies’ monitoring of safety in a post-marketing setting also is similar to that of the FDA.

The filling process has been developed by Ikaria as a high-throughput batch fill process that leverages several technologies that Ikaria has developed, and we have licensed, to fill the cartridge (containers) at a higher pressure and purity.
     This manufacturing system is designed to be modular and can be expanded as needed. The current installed capacity within the Port Allen plant is sufficient to support our INOpulse clinical program as currently planned. In addition, the plant has the capacity to expand to meet additional demand. We have a license from Ikaria to use this fill process technology to work with additional companies, as needed, to produce the final cartridge. Commercial supply manufacturing can be supported with additional units installed at the Port Allen site or other regional locations, by Ikaria or other manufacturers, as determined by distribution requirements. For our clinical trials, Ikaria can supply and ship product from the Port Allen site and the current cartridges have a shelf life of at least two years. We are testing the finished product to potentially establish a shelf life of up to three years.

INOpulse Drug Delivery Systems

In February 2015, we entered into an agreement with Flextronics Medical Sales and Marketing Ltd., a subsidiary of Flextronics International Ltd., or Flextronics, to manufacture and service the INOpulse device.

PAH patients have the potential for rebound PH, which is a sudden and serious increase in pulmonary arterial pressure that results from therapy withdrawal. However, in the Phase 2 trial, all patients were tested for rebound PH and we found no adjudicated cases of rebound PH with this testing.  Subjects in our PAH trials are all on at least one background specific PAH therapy, the majority being on two or more PAH therapies.  These background therapies likely protect against rebound.  Though the likelihood of rebound PH is very low, all patients with PAH are provided with a backup system. 

Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our products. In addition, other companies are increasingly looking at cardiopulmonary indications as a potential opportunity. It is possible that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of unmet needs in our target markets will increase.

Our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, may have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining approval for therapies and achieving widespread market acceptance. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs and advanced technologies become available.

Currently, we believe there are 14 drugs approved for the treatment of PAH, within the following categories: prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogs (including Flolan (epoprostenol), which is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, Tyvaso (treprostinil), Orenitram (treprostinil) and Remodulin (treprostinil), which are marketed by United Therapeutics Corporation, Ventavis (iloprost) and Veletri (epoprostenol), which are marketed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (a Johnson & Johnson company), or Actelion, and Beraprost (which is a generic available in Asian markets), phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (including Adcirca (tadalafil), which is marketed by United Therapeutics Corporation, and Revatio (sildenafil), which is marketed by Pfizer Inc.), endothelin receptor antagonists (including Letairis (ambrisentan), which is marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., and Opsumit (macitentan) and Tracleer (bosentan), which are marketed by Actelion) and a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (Adempas (riociguat), which is marketed by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc.). The most recent addition to the list is Uptravi (selexipag), a selective prostacyclin receptor agonist, which is marketed by Actelion and was approved by the FDA in December 2015.
There are also other treatments for PAH in various phases of development, including other nitric oxide generation and delivery systems such as GeNOsyl™ (being developed by GeNO LLC) and a nebulized formulation of nitrite (being developed by Mast Therapeutics) both in Phase 2 development. Further, Insmed, Inc. is developing an investigational, sustained-release, inhaled treprostinil prodrug, SteadyMed Therapeutics, Inc., or Steady Med, is developing Trevyent™ which delivers treprostinil using SteadyMed's PatchPump technology and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation is developing QCC374 an inhaled prostacyclin receptor agonist.
Currently, there are no approved therapies for treating PH-COPD, and the only generally accepted treatments are LTOT, pulmonary rehabilitation and lung transplant, and we are not aware of any therapies for PH-COPD in advanced clinical development. Currently, there are no approved therapies for treating PH-ILD including PH-IPF and we are not aware of any therapies in advanced clinical development.

Patents and Proprietary Rights
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to protect, for example, our product candidates, related technologies and/or other aspects of the inventions that are important to our business. Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications cover patentable subject matter from composition of matter, methods of use, devices and device components, critical safety features and design components with respect to INOpulse. However, patent protection is not available for the composition of matter of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in INOpulse since nitric oxide is a naturally occurring molecule.
19

Actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to inventions which provide additional patent protection for our product offering, for instance, device enhancements, safety features and manufacturing processes. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also consider know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary positions.
A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of our programs. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. For example, if we want to expand the indications for which we could develop and commercialize pulsed nitric oxide beyond the Bellerophon indications, we will need to obtain a license from Ikaria.
The patent positions of therapeutics companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors. Any patents that we own or license may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of inventions for any patent applications filed with the USPTO on or before March 15, 2013. Likewise, derivation proceedings may also be declared for any patent filings filed after March 15, 2013.
The patents and patent applications that relate to our programs are described below.
INOpulse

As of December 31, 2017, we hold exclusive licenses from Ikaria to at least 100 patents and pending patent applications in both the United States and foreign countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore and South Africa.  Certain of these issued patents and patent applications, if issued, will expire as late as 2033. These patent rights have been exclusively licensed for the treatment of patients with Bellerophon indications and cover methods of delivery and the drug delivery device, as well as important safety features and the ornamental design of the drug delivery device.

A primary basis for patent exclusivity is based on pending and issued in-licensed patents directed to proprietary methods of administering pulsed inhaled nitric oxide, as well as a device for delivering the same. At least one patent has been issued in the United States as well as Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, and Mexico.  Patent applications are pending in Australia, Brazil, Europe, Hong Kong, Mexico and the United States.  This patent family expires as late as 2027 in the United States and in 2026 in the other countries.

Another important basis for patent exclusivity is based on an in-licensed portfolio of patents, directed to novel nasal cannula features that we believe are necessary for the accurate, safe and efficacious administration of pulsed nitric oxide. The patent family consists of four issued U.S. patents and one issued European patent, as well as pending applications in the United States as well as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico and South Africa. Each of these patents and patent applications, if issued, will expire in 2033 in the United States and abroad.

Another in-licensed patent family relates to features of the drug delivery canister necessary for providing drug product 
20

for use with our proprietary pulsing drug delivery device. This patent family includes at least one issued patent in each of the United States, Australia, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia and Singapore, as well as pending patent applications in the United States, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia and Singapore. These pending applications, if issued, as well as the non-U.S. issued patents will expire in 2029. The issued U.S. patent will expire in 2030.

Several other patent families directed to device and safety features are issued and pending. Furthermore, design patents covering the ornamental designs of the intended commercial device and clinical device have been granted. We have also filed several Company-owned patent applications relating to the use of nitric oxide.

In addition, the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to our nitric oxide program for the treatment of PAH, which could result in marketing exclusivity of seven years in the United States should this be the first NDA approved for inhaled nitric oxide in this indication. The active ingredient, nitric oxide, was previously approved by the FDA as a drug in a separate clinical application. Accordingly, any related patent rights will not be eligible for a patent term extension under relevant provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
 
Patent Term

The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by a terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.

The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act to account for at least some of the time the drug or device is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug or device for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent. Thus, patent term extension is not available for INOpulse since the active moiety is nitric oxide, which is already subject to an approved NDA. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug or device. Some foreign jurisdictions have analogous patent term extension provisions that allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a device approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. 

Trade Secrets

In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. For example, elements of the manufacture of our products are based on trade secrets and know-how that are not publicly disclosed. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties.
Trademarks

We also seek trademark protection where available and when appropriate. The symbol ™ indicates a common law trademark. Other service marks, trademarks and trade names appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners.
Government Regulation

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, clearance, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with 
21

subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.

Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States must typically undertake the following:

• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with applicable good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before a clinical trial may be initiated at that site;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Pre-Clinical Studies

Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the toxicity, safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of pre-clinical and other non-clinical studies is subject to FDA regulations, including GLP regulations. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term pre-clinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trial and places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.

After the IND becomes effective, the sponsor continues to perform nonclinical studies including those related to development of a manufacturing process that is capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, development of methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to support the eventual shelf life and storage of the drug. 

Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA

22

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each phase of a clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 

In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease (e.g., cancer) or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. 


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 


Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse effects, or SAEs, occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. In addition, the sponsor of a clinical trial must register and post information about the trial on the National Institutes of Health's clinicaltrials.gov website.

Section 505(b)(2) NDAs

NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full, or pivotal, clinical trials that must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe and effective and relied upon by the applicant “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.”

Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs submitted under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain pre-clinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies to support any differences from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.

Submission of an NDA to the FDA

23

Assuming successful completion of clinical trials and other requirements, the results of the non-clinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug candidate for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a user fee, which for FY2018 exceeds $2.4 million for NDAs that require clinical trials, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fee of $304,162. These fees are typically increased annually.

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission whether the application will be filed because it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for various reasons, including for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will often inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.

The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions.
Special Protocol Assessment
A sponsor of an IND may request that the FDA evaluate within 45 days certain protocols and issues relating to the protocols to assess whether they are adequate to meet scientific and regulatory requirements for approval. If the trials were the subject of discussion at an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a special protocol assessment, or SPAs, may be requested for clinical protocols for Phase 3 trials whose data is intended to form the primary basis for an efficacy claim. If the sponsor and the FDA reach a written agreement regarding the protocol, the SPAs will be considered binding on the FDA and will not be changed unless the sponsor fails to follow the agreed-upon protocol, data supporting the request are found to be false or incomplete, or the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began. Even if a SPA is agreed to, approval of the NDA is not guaranteed since a final determination that an agreed-upon protocol satisfies a specific objective, such as the demonstration of efficacy, or supports an approval decision, will be based on a complete review of all the data in the NDA. 
Expedited Review and Approval
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre NDA meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Priority review, which is requested at the time of NDA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs to treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. Discussions with the FDA about the feasibility of an accelerated approval typically begin early in the development of 
24

the drug in order to identify, among other things, an appropriate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post marketing clinical trials to confirm the appropriateness of the surrogate marker trial.
In the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Improvement Act, or FDASIA, Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of products under accelerated approval. The law required the FDA to issue related draft guidance within a year after the law’s enactment and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. The FDA published a final guidance on May 30, 2014, entitled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics.” One of the expedited programs added by FDASIA is that for Breakthrough Therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). A sponsor may request Breakthrough Therapy designation at the time that the IND is submitted, or no later than at the end of Phase II meeting. The FDA will respond to a Breakthrough Therapy designation request within sixty days of receipt of the request. A drug that receives Breakthrough Therapy designation is eligible for all fast track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase I and commitment from the FDA involving senior managers. The FDA has designated over 150 drugs as breakthrough therapies (some were subsequently withdrawn), and over 80 original or supplemental applications with breakthrough designations have been approved to date.

The FDA’s Decision on an NDA

On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.

The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

Post-Approval Requirements

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced 
25

inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Compliance with cGMPs requires, among other things, investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and the manufacturer. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.


The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.

Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs

In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the pre-clinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.

Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.

Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.

Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be submitted to the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period 
26

of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.

Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay

Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant submits its application to the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.

Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
·                 the required patent information has not been filed;
·                 the listed patent has expired;
·                 the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
·                 the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

If the ANDA applicant or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.

Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting a NDA. If the request is granted, FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product will be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a Written Request), relating to the use of the 
27

active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, biologics license application and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication where orphan designation has been granted. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.

Patent Term Restoration and Extension

A patent claiming a new drug product or medical device may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a new drug product is typically one-half the time between the date a clinical investigation on human beings is begun and the submission date of an application for premarket approval of the product, plus the time between the submission date of an application for approval of the product and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.

Review and Approval of Medical Devices in the United States

Medical devices in the United States are strictly regulated by the FDA. Under the FDCA a medical device is defined as “an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, -in vitro- reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component, part or accessory which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes.” This definition provides a clear distinction between a medical device and other FDA regulated products such as drugs. If the primary intended use of the product is achieved through chemical action or by being metabolized by the body, the product is usually a drug. If not, it is generally a medical device.

Unless an exemption applies, a new medical device may not be marketed in the United States unless and until it has been cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process, or 510(k), or approved by the FDA pursuant to a premarket approval application, or PMA. The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes on the basis of the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness.

Class I devices are those low risk devices for which reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness can be provided by adherence to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events and malfunctions and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Many Class I devices are exempt from premarket regulation; however, some Class I devices require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process.

Class II devices are moderate risk devices and are subject to the FDA’s general controls, and any other special controls, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, and FDA guidelines, deemed necessary by the FDA to provide reasonable assurance of the devices’ safety and effectiveness. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices 
28

are accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, although some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirements. Premarket notifications are subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies.

Class III devices are deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as those for which reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness cannot be assured solely by the general controls and special controls described above and that are life-sustaining or life-supporting. A PMA must provide valid scientific evidence, typically extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA (and supplemental PMAs) are subject to significantly higher user fees than are 510(k) premarket notifications.

Post-Marketing Restrictions and Enforcement

After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:

• | submitting and updating establishment registration and device listings with the FDA;


• | compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, record maintenance, including maintenance of complaint and related investigation files, and other quality assurance controls during the manufacturing process;


• | unannounced routine or for-cause device inspections by the FDA, which may include our suppliers’ facilities; and


• | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including requirements to conduct post-market surveillance studies to establish continued safety data or tracking products through the chain of distribution to the patient level.


Under the FDA medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device of such manufacturer were to recur. The decision to file an MDR involves a judgment by the manufacturer. If the FDA disagrees with the manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can take enforcement action.

Additionally, the FDA has the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. The authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within ten working days after the recall is initiated.

The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:

• | warning letters, fines, injunctions or civil penalties;


• | recalls, detentions or seizures of products;


• | operating restrictions;


• | delays in the introduction of products into the market;


• | total or partial suspension of production;


• | delay or refusal of the FDA or other regulators to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new products;


• | withdrawals of 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals; or


• | in the most serious cases, criminal prosecution.


To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and 
29

periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors.

Review and Approval of Combination Products in the United States

Certain products may be comprised of components that would normally be subject to different regulatory requirements, and frequently by different Centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:

• | a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;


• | two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products;


• | a drug or device packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug or device where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or


• | any investigational drug or device packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.


Under the FDCA, the FDA assigns primary jurisdiction to a lead center at the FDA for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a device-drug combination product is attributable to the drug product, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA's Office of Combination Products addresses issues related to combination products and is intended to provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.

Rest of World Government Regulation 

In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company will have to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between and among countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which products are covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations and the amount that will be paid. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic 
30

products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.

In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed to. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.

Healthcare Law and Regulation

If our product candidates are approved, we will be subject to federal and state fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which include the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;


• | the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;


• | the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;


• | the federal transparency requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA will require applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, drugs and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations may apply to us.


Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance 
31

guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Sales and Marketing
We do not have a sales, marketing or distribution infrastructure and have limited experience in the sale, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. We expect to build a commercial infrastructure to allow us to market and sell certain of our product candidates when approved, if any, using a specialty sales force in the United States, and we may choose to establish commercialization capabilities in select countries outside the United States.
