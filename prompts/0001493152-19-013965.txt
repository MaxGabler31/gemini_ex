General
 
We were organized under the laws of the State of Oregon on July 27, 1992 as Sky Technologies, Inc. On August 1, 1994, our name was officially changed by a vote of a majority of our shareholders to REGI U.S., Inc.
 
On July 27th, 2016, REGI undertook a reorganization, naming its wholly owned subsidiary, RadMax Technologies, Inc. (“RadMax”) as its DBA for marketing and technology image.
 
On September 16, 2016, REGI entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “APA”) with Reg Technologies Inc. (“Reg Tech”), a British Columbia public company whose common stock was listed on TSX Venture Exchange to purchase all of the assets of Reg Tech, a company with a common director and CEO with REGI. An aggregate of 51,757,119 unregistered common shares of our company were issued as consideration for the asset purchase. The transaction was closed on February 17, 2017 upon TSX Venture Exchange approval.
 
Prior to the APA, REGI and Reg Tech had been engaged in the business of developing and commercially exploiting an improved axial vane type rotary engine known as the Rand Cam/Direct Charge Engine (the “RC/DC Engine”) with the marketing and intellectual rights in the U.S. held by REGI and the worldwide marketing and intellectual rights, other than in the U.S., held by Reg Tech. Upon closing the APA, REGI owns the worldwide rights to the technologies. We will need to raise additional capital in the future beyond any amount currently on hand and which may become available as a result of debt and/or equity financing, including the exercise of options which are currently outstanding, in order to fully implement our intended plan of operations.
 
Business of the Company
 
Overview and History
 
RadMax, is a wholly owned subsidiary of REGI U.S., Inc., based in Spokane, Washington. It is a technology and product development company that is designing, building and proving the functionality of a family of smaller, lighter and more energy-efficient axial vane, rotary engines, compressors, pumps and gas expanders for, commercial, residential and government applications. Our focus is on developing innovative devices that reduce carbon footprint, device size, weight and parts count, while increasing fuel and manufacturing efficiencies over incumbent technologies. Our proprietary sliding axial vane technology enables our devices to deliver high output to weight ratios making them easily scalable from small to very large. We intend to develop and market these devices in cooperation with our industry, government, and private investor partners. We are initially focused on applications that are new and disruptive, in that they are more efficient, environmentally friendly, compact and cost-effective while offering a broader operational range than those currently available.
 
Our patented RadMax sliding axial vane technology, has vanes that form chambers on both sides of the rotor, the volume of these chambers change as the vanes follows along the cam profile. This results in alternately compressing and expanding vapors / fluids at both cam locations offering the following key advantages over competitive devices:
 

● | Compact design with high output to size and weight ratios 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Simple operation, low parts count and fewer moving parts 
● | The option of integral electricity generation 
● | Easily scalable from small to very large 
● | Able to operate at much lower temperatures and pressures than incumbent devices, dramatically broadening the range of potential market applications 

 
From our headquarters in Spokane, WA, we are working with our engineering staff, as well as outside engineering and business consultants, to design, build, and commercialize these devices. Our goal is to license or sell RadMax technology and/or participate in joint ventures to manufacture RadMax products for a broad spectrum of industries and applications. Examples of industries and applications that could benefit from our technology include (but are not limited to); transportation, aerospace, air conditioning and refrigeration, oil and gas production and distribution, power generation, water desalination and purification, pumps, commercial building dehumidification/carbon dioxide removal, and military markets. In addition to its potential use as prime mover, the RadMax technology design is being employed in the development of several types of compressors, pumps, and gas expanders.

To date, several gas expander prototypes have been built and are involved in on-going bench scale testing. Additional prototype development and testing is underway. This testing is aligned with the specifications provided in several Department of Energy (DOE) / Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) grant proposals, or through discussions with the large A/C, refrigeration Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM’s). We plan for this work to continue until a commercially feasible design is built, tested and sold into a specific market application. However, there is no assurance at this time that such commercially feasible designs will ever be perfected or will become profitable. If a commercially feasible design is perfected, we expect to derive revenues from licensing the RadMax technology, selling the rights to specific applications and markets, selling our intellectual property, or selling the company. However, there is no assurance at this time that revenues will ever be received from any of the aforementioned revenue paths, even if it does prove to be commercially feasible.
 
Based on our prototype testing and modeling we believe that multiple markets exist for RadMax rotary devices. We also believe that these devices can be produced at competitive prices, and provide a combination of energy utilization efficiency, power density and flexibility
 
Technology Overview
 
RadMax patented technology is a family of smaller, lighter and more energy-efficient engines, compressors, pumps, gas expanders and combined devices designed for simplicity, efficiency and power. Our devices are easily configurable to meet the needs of diverse applications and requirements.
 
The RadMax rotary principle is unique. As many as 12 straight vanes reciprocate parallel to the axis of rotation through a rotor and compress or expand fluids in the same manner as reciprocating piston devices. The rotating, reciprocating vanes follow the sinusoidal surfaces of stationary cams in the end housings, forming chambers on both sides of the rotor between the rotor, stator walls and vanes. The chamber volume changes as the vane follows along the cam profile during the rotor’s revolution, resulting in alternately compressing and/or expanding fluids at both cam locations, depending on the device’s application. The desired device configuration is achieved by simply changing the cam profile and / or intake and exhaust porting locations in the cam instead of having to use complicated valve systems.
 
Unlike piston devices, a minimum of energy is lost due to reciprocating motion and accelerations. Because the upper and lower faces of the rotor are 90-degrees out of phase, and the vanes move parallel to the direction of rotation, a RadMax device is always balanced and exhibits nominal vibration.
 
Simply changing the cam profile and / or intake and exhaust porting locations, a RadMax device can be designed as an internal combustion engine, compressor, pump, gas expander, or a combination of these functions.
 
A RadMax device is combination of four distinct sections; two intake and discharge cycles on each cam. This unique design allows for each of these sections to be independently configured with different combinations of compression and expansion ratios allowing for such things as multi-stage expansion / compression by porting one section output into and between the different sections.
 
A truly unique capability of our technology design is the ability to combine more than one machine function into a single RadMax device. The RadMax mechanism is comprised of two cams connected by a common driveshaft in a single housing. By using separate vane actuator systems, it is possible to have two separately functioning cam cycles – for example an engine, pump, compressor, or gas expander – in the same device. The resulting compact device provides increased flexible functionality and high performance in a smaller footprint than two separate devices. These characteristics make RadMax combined-cycle devices well suited for applications with weight restrictions and limited space, such as the RadMax external combustion engine, auxiliary and backup power generation, waste heat recovery, portable pumps, compressors and generators, and gas system throttling loss recovery.
 
Additionally, because of its unique rotary design, it is possible to design electricity generation components directly into and as part of the RadMax device, thus eliminating the need and space for a separate generator. Incorporating an integrated generator into RadMax engines and gas expanders allows for the option to utilize all of the device’s power to generate electricity or use some or all of it to power other devices through its shaft.

------------


As an engine, RadMax devices provide power through the expansion of gases, which in turn is converted to shaft torque. When configured as an internal combustion four-stroke engine, combustion occurs within the device’s internal combustion chamber. The hot, pressurized gases cause the rotor to revolve, releasing energy through expansion as the combustion chamber increases in volume. Because the RadMax design can have up to 12 vanes, the engine generates an incredible 24 power strokes per rotation, 12 on the upper side of the rotor and 12 on the lower side. Due to this efficient design, a RadMax internal combustion engine will produce four times the horsepower per revolution compared to an equivalent-displacement four-cycle piston engine. The RadMax external combustion engine is a low-pressure Brayton cycle engine that uses a gas expander rather than a traditional turbine. Various prototype engines for both diesel and spark- ignition configurations have been built ranging from 10 to over 300 horsepower.
 
Products and Applications
 
RadMax Compressed Gas Expander
 
The RadMax compressed gas expander is a positive-displacement device that is uniquely able to capture both kinetic and pressure-volume energy and convert it to rotational power in compressed gas expansion applications. This power can then be used to drive other devices such as compressors and electrical generators. Additional efficiency can be gained by incorporating electric power generation directly into the gas expander.
Key Advantages:
 

● | Able to efficiently expand low density gases 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Developed torque can be used to internally generate electricity or drive an external device 
● | Variable expansion ratios possible 
● | Able to achieve higher work efficiencies at lower speeds 
● | Easily scalable from small to large devices 
● | Use can decrease electricity consumption in the USA by $5 to $15 billion. 
● | Use can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by over 100 million tons in the USA alone. 

Applications:
 
The RadMax gas expander, when paired with a generator can replace less efficient devices such as the throttling valves in air conditioning and refrigeration systems. The incumbent free gas expansion valves and mechanical throttling valves are not capable of capturing available pressure energy. The RadMax compressed gas expander is also used as the turbine component in the RadMax expander engine, it is used to capture lost energy in natural gas pipelines and throttling stations, and is used to generate electricity from flare gas, solar, and geothermal sources.
 
We are currently focused on designing and building prototype devices targeted for use in the air conditioning / refrigeration and natural gas distribution industries. When used these devices can significantly reduce electric power requirements and associated carbon dioxide emissions. RadMax is currently partnering with the DOE via PNNL on a variety of Solar Energy Technology Office (SETO), Geothermal Technology Office (GTO), and Building Technology Office (BTO) grant proposals and projects.
 
RadMax is also actively soliciting industry leading corporations to evaluate and commercialize these products in their current and future product designs. Several of these companies are supporting the proof of concept projects underway with the DOE and PNNL.
 
RadMax Compressor
 
The RadMax positive displacement compressor incorporates the advantages of both positive displacement and centrifugal compressors by utilizing the volumetric energy of a positive-displacement compressor and the kinetic energy of a centrifugal compressor to pressurize a gas. A combination of four distinct sections, this unique design allows for each section to be configured with a different compression ratio and allows multi-stage compression in one device.
 
Key Advantages:
 

● | High internal compression ratios possible 
--+----------------------------------------------
● | High volume output to size ratio

● | Able to efficiently compress low density gases 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Better handle entrained liquids in compressed gases (2 Phase) 
● | Compressors are easily scalable from small to very large 

 
Additionally, the inherent design of the RadMax sliding vane principle lends itself to better handle two-phase (liquid/vapor) fluids, improved efficiency for enhanced refrigeration and steam cycle applications all of which are targeted end uses.
 
RadMax is also actively soliciting industry leading corporations to evaluate and commercialize these products in their current and future product designs. Several of these companies are supporting the proof of concept projects underway with the DOE and PNNL.
 
Applications:
 
Compressing refrigerants for industrial, commercial, residential and automotive air conditioning systems; industrial gas compressing; natural gas field and pipeline gas compression; low density gas to high pressure. The RadMax compressor is being tested in DOE SETO and GTO projects that use metal Organic Framework Materials (MOF’s) as sorbents fix a thermal compressor and for a novel dehumidification/carbon dioxide capture system. The RadMax compressor is used to pull a vacuum on these sorbents which dramatically improves loading / unloading efficiency significantly increasing productivity while lowering the cost of the process.
RadMax Combined Function Devices:
 
A unique attribute of the RadMax technology is the ability to combine more than one machine function into a single device. The combined function device is comprised of two cams connected by a common driveshaft in a single housing. By using separate vane actuator systems, it is possible to have two separately functioning cam cycles (i.e. engine, pump, compressor, or gas expander) in the same device.
Key Advantages:
 

● | Increased design flexibility and functionality 
--+------------------------------------------------------------
● | Compact size with high performance 
● | Reduced size, weight, parts count and cost 
● | Rapid field change-out capability 
● | Scalable from small to very large devices 
● | Can utilize Brayton, Rankine and Organic Rankine cycles 

Applications:
 
RadMax external combustion engines, applications with limited space and weight restrictions such as auxiliary and backup power generation, waste heat recovery, portable pumps, compressors, generators, and compressed gas system throttling energy recovery for A/C and refrigeration systems.
 
RadMax Pump
 
The RadMax positive displacement pump pairs the high-volume capacity of positive displacement pump with the simplicity and efficiency of a centrifugal pump. A RadMax pump is able to utilize the volumetric displacement energy of the fluid and the kinetic energy of the vane action. This results in an extraordinarily energy efficient pump. A combination of four distinct sections, this unique design allows for different pumping actions or flow rates/streams in one device.
 
Key Advantages:
 

● | Creates high output volume to size and weight ratios 
--+---------------------------------------------------------
● | Better handling of gas-entrained liquids 
● | Self-priming & auto re-priming 
● | Can operate as a boost or lift pump 
● | Multiple smooth pumping actions per rotation 
● | Scalable from small to very large devices

RadMax has actively pursued the development of the RadMax pump by offering an exclusive license, to make and sell these devices, in return for their product development funding.
 
Applications:
 
Because of its efficient, high-volume output, the RadMax pump is well suited for fire protection; water and flood control; irrigation; marine; water treatment; oil and gas industry down hole and subsea; industrial processes; heavy industry and construction; and portable pump applications.
RadMax Internal / External Combustion Engines:
 
We believe that the RadMax internal and external combustion engines can achieve improved fuel and mechanical efficiencies when compared to traditional combustion engine designs, based on the inherently efficient design and thermodynamic characteristics of the engine. A higher expansion to compression ratio is possible with our internal combustion engine design resulting in increased fuel efficiency.
 
The RadMax engine is characterized by high torque, compact size, and a high horsepower-to-weight ratio, making it an ideal option for various transportation, and power generation applications. Long service life, low power-to-weight ratio, and increasing environmental concerns and regulations are prompting a second look at the viability of gas turbine engines for more mainstream applications. A gas turbine engine’s optimized combustion produces fewer total emissions than internal- combustion engines. However, their lower operating efficiencies and higher operating and capital costs are impediments to their increased use.
 
A RadMax “external” combustion expander (turbine) engine incorporating RadMax’s higher efficiency, positive displacement compressors and gas expanders, coupled with an optimized external combustor, can significantly improve fuel and energy extraction efficiency over existing gas turbine engines. Having true “multi-fuel” capability, the RadMax turbine engine would be well suited for hybrid engine and power generation applications. We are seeking co-development partners to move further engine development forward.
 
Key Advantages:
 

● | Compact size & weight (~25% of comparable hp piston) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | High power to weight ratio (>1 hp/lb) 
● | High internal expansion ratios possible 
● | Continual, smooth rotary motion 
● | Easily scalable 20 – 1,500hp 
● | Low part count and fewer moving parts; conducive to rapid change-out replacement, reduced maintenance costs and increased reliability 

Applications:
 
Primary and backup power generation; automotive & truck, aviation, marine and industrial applications prime mover; hybrid vehicles

Recent Developments
 
Grid Adapting Power, Cooling, and Desalination System for Geothermal Resources:
 
We are partnering with PNNL on a water desalination grant proposal as well as a HARP desalination plus power generation grant proposal from the DOE. These projects utilize RadMax expanders and compressors to increase overall efficiency and lower the Levelized Cost of Water (LCOW) to approximately half what the average municipality pays in the USA. Such projects allow us to construct a proof-of-concept device that can then be used to demonstrate the inherent advantages of our technology to OEM’s in the refrigeration, A/C, cold storage, and natural gas transportation / distribution industries. The expander will be used to power a generator on the HARP system pilot plant prototype at PNNL. The HARP system uses a low-quality heat source such as solar, geothermal, or waste process heat to generate electricity to either generate electricity or potable water dependent on market needs and economics.
Natural Gas Industry Gas Expander Demonstration Project Negotiations
 
Ongoing communications continue with a major private natural gas production company to develop a demonstration project utilizing the RadMax expander for generating electricity from pressure letdown points along natural gas pipelines. The RadMax expander is able to capture some of the energy normally lost by the “throttling” pressure relief valves it is designed to replace and convert that energy into electricity or shaft power. Replacing the “non-energy generating” throttling pressure relief valves along global natural gas distribution networks has the potential to generate billions of dollars of electricity and save millions of tons of CO 2 emissions.
Air Conditioning / Refrigeration System OEM Collaboration
 
Collaborations have begun with leading OEM’s in the refrigeration / cooling / cold storage industry to define specifications, economics and performance requirements for the adoption of RadMax expanders and compressors into their system designs. A large A/C, cooling OEM has agreed to donate A/C equipment to facilitate refrigerant based testing at our Spokane testing facility.
 
Completed Spin Testing of the RadMax 375 hp Diesel Engine.
 
Pre-combustion spin testing of the 375 hp diesel engine was successfully completed. Mechanical and compression test results were all found to be within expected ranges. Additional components will need to be designed before combustion tests can be initiated. Due to the expensive and time-consuming nature of introducing and integrating new technologies into the North American automotive industry all future development efforts have been placed on hold until a suitable co- development partner can be found.
 
Expanded Technical Staff
 
Increased interest in our products and accelerated product development activities resulted the hiring of two fulltime engineers. These additions to our staff not only allow for faster product development, but also reduce our reliance on outside consultants and machine shops.
New Corporate Officers
 
On March 27, 2019, Paul Chute came out of retirement and was appointed Chief Executive Officer after having been appointed its Chief Financial Officer of the Company on September 30, 2018. On April 30, 2019, Lynn L. Petersen was appointed to the position of Vice President of Business Development and appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors.
Expander Performance Modeling
 
Expander and compressor configuration, performance and design modelling has been extensively utilized to maximize our resources while reducing cost and the number of device iterations milled during the product development and testing process. Additionally, comprehensive modeling has used to design and develop two-phase fluid (vapor / liquid) capability to our expanders and compressors.

Natural Gas Meter Power Module Proposal
 
Initial discussions have been initiated, under a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with a major, North American based utility metering OEM about developing a demonstration gen-set device for residential and commercial natural gas meters. Smart gas meters that are able to remotely communicate gas consumption and meter status are quickly being adopted by global utilities. Current smart meters require the use of a non-recharging battery to power the meter limiting its functionality and requiring periodic replacement. In the same manner as at other locations along the natural gas distribution system, a RadMax expander at residential and commercial installations is able to generate enough electricity from the gas flow through the meter to not only charge the smart meter’s battery, but also expand the functionality of the meter. In higher gas use residential, commercial and industrial installations, enough electricity is generated to justify the cost of putting the excess electricity back into the electrical grid, reducing the net cost of the gas and reducing utility electricity generation requirements.
Competition and Alternative Technologies
 
We currently face and will continue to face pressure from established companies that desire to develop, manufacture and sell products that offer the same advantages as our devices. While currently, not a highly competitive business, in terms of the number of competitors, the business of developing innovative lower cost, higher efficiency, and higher performing technologies is nonetheless difficult because most existing producers are large, well-financed, and have an established market presence that they will aggressively defend. For these reasons we are more inclined to initially manufacture and sell devices to demonstrate proof-of-concept after which time we plan to contract manufacture, sell licenses to applications / geographies, and / or sell our IP / company. The development of our business and its ability to maintain its competitive, and technical position will continue to depend upon our ability to attract investors and to retain qualified; engineering, financial, and managerial personnel.
 
Our guiding business strategy is to develop RadMax technology products for applications that are either looking for a solution, or where our product offers significant advantages in performance and / or financially over incumbent products. This strategy implies that our co-development industry partners will be “early adopters” looking for new “green” products to enhance their market position, broaden their product line, and increase their market share and margins.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment have not had a material impact on our business.
 
Availability of Raw Materials
 
Since we only intend to manufacture prototype devices used to demonstrate proof-of-concept, raw materials are not a major concern. That said, it is important to note that a key responsibility during the design of any prototype is to always consider raw material function, performance, availability and cost, to ensure that the device performs as designed and achieves projected cost targets. Once proof-of-concept is achieved it is our intention to contract out manufacturing to increase efficiency and production capacity, while reducing lead times and material costs. At this time, using current materials of construction, there does not appear to be any foreseeable problem obtaining any materials or components.
Marketing Strategy
 
Over the past two years we have built prototypes of the compressed gas expander, as well as an internal combustion diesel engine. Since it is extremely difficult, time consuming and expensive to gain traction in the internal combustion engine markets we have focused our efforts on producing proof-of-concept gas expanders and / or generators targeted for the air conditioning, refrigeration, and power generation markets. Specifically, we intend to introduce innovative new devices that capture lost energy that can be sold back into the grid, used to power Smart devices, used to recharge batteries, or used to power parasitic devices, all of which significantly reduce energy consumption / operating costs. Our devices capture some of the energy lost in the compression phase of these cycles by generating electricity or torque during the expansion (let down) portion of the cycle. We are currently collaborating with the PNNL on several DOE grants that are focused on improving efficiency and / or decreasing operating costs in the refrigeration and power generation markets. Our goal is to develop a demonstration expander- generator that is compatible with refrigerants used in air conditioning, refrigeration, and refrigerant based ORC systems. These ORC systems use a low temperature heat source such as solar, geothermal, or other waste process heat for power to drive a wide variety of power generation, refrigeration, air conditioning, and water desalination / purification applications. Additionally, slightly modified versions of the same device can extract megawatts of “lost” power by replacing throttling valves on compressed natural gas pipelines, or significantly improve the efficiency of steam power plants by reducing fossil fuel consumption and the associated CO2 emissions.

Our marketing plan is to develop prototype expanders for the wide range of refrigeration applications, quickly followed by a line of expanders for the natural gas transportation industry. These devices are very energy efficient as they capture some of the energy lost in the compression cycle. That captured energy is then used to power Smart and / or parasitic devices or allow for the sale of the power back to the utility. We plan to manufacture the initial proof-of-concept devices in order to gain traction in these markets before either moving to a contract manufacturer, licensing the technology for each potential market / geographic area, or selling the company. In order to continually evolve the technology RadMax intends to design, manufacture and sell custom devices into specialty, lower volume, high value applications through the use of inhouse and third-party manufacturing. We are currently focused on capitalizing on the RadMax expander’s unique capability to capture and covert, to usable work normally “lost” energy by pressure regulating throttling valves. The use of this energy can contribute significantly to the overall efficiency and operating cost structure of the host system. We have identified air conditioning/refrigeration and natural gas distribution applications as high value market targets. We are consequently working with the DOE and PNNL as well as industry OEM’s in these two areas to develop demonstration projects for our technology.
 
RadMax Marketing Objectives are to:
 

A. | Market to high volume OEM’s using performance data extracted from a series of pilot plant trials to encourage them to tailor the design for incorporation into existing and next generation systems / products. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. | Manufacture our devices in-house for the short-term and as volumes increase through third parties, for sale to OEMs to be incorporated into their products. 
C. | RadMax plans to design and sell directly into niche markets in order to keep evolving and expanding the technology. 
D. | License the technology to high volume manufacturers who prefer to manufacture our devices themselves or through their existing supply channels. 
E. | Sell the technology rights to specific markets and / or geographies.
