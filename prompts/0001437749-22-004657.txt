--------+---------

Overview
 
In February 2021, we changed our name from TransEnterix, Inc. to Asensus Surgical, Inc. We are a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to pioneer a new era of Performance-Guided Surgery™ by unlocking clinical intelligence for surgeons to enable consistently superior outcomes and a new standard of laparoscopic surgery. This builds upon the foundation of Digital Laparoscopy with our Senhance® Surgical System powered by the Intelligent Surgical Unit™ (ISU™) to increase surgeon control and reduce surgical variability. With the addition of machine vision, augmented intelligence, and deep learning capabilities throughout the surgical experience, we intend to holistically address the current clinical, cognitive and economic shortcomings that drive surgical outcomes and value-based healthcare.
 
Our mission is focused on leveraging robotic technologies, augmented intelligence, and machine learning capabilities to: reduce variability in surgery, drive more predictable outcomes, optimize resources and costs, and work with hospital systems that strive to employ innovative healthcare strategies. By leveraging advanced digital technologies, we aim to enable surgeons to take the best surgical practices and techniques from everywhere and utilize them to help improve outcomes, reduce variability, control the unexpected, reduce costs, reduce cognitive and physical fatigue of surgeons, and provide patients with the best care possible. We believe that by digitizing the interface between the surgeon and patient, we can unlock clinical intelligence to pioneer a new era of surgery, which we are calling Performance-Guided Surgery.
 
Historical advances in surgery have largely focused on bringing tools and techniques into the operating room to reduce the invasiveness of procedures. When we introduced Digital Laparoscopy, our intention was to help surgeons minimize surgical variability in a cost-effective manner. The next logical step in the progression is looking for ways to deliver clinical intelligence and analytics which we believe can be enabled by what we refer to as Performance-Guided Surgery.
 
Performance-Guided Surgery builds upon our foundation of Digital Laparoscopy by adding machine vision, augmented intelligence, and deep learning capabilities through all surgical phases to help guide improved decision making, enriched collaboration, and enhanced predictability for all surgeons (independent of skill level and experience). Our Performance-Guided Surgery strategy is composed of the following framework:
 

● | Pre-operative - in what we call “intelligent preparation,” our machine learning models will take data from all procedures done utilizing our current Senhance System with the ISU, such as tracking surgical motion and team interaction, to create a large and constantly improving database of surgeries and their outcomes to enable surgeons to best inform their approach and surgical setup.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Intra-operative – we believe the Senhance System provides “perceptive real-time guidance” for intra-operative tasks, allowing any surgeon performing a procedure with the Senhance System to perform multiple tasks and benefit from the collective knowledge and rules-based performance of thousands of other successful Senhance-based procedures. Not only will this provide the surgeon with a pathway to better outcomes, but we also believe it will ultimately help reduce the cognitive load of the surgeons.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Post-operative – finally, by tapping into the vast amount of data captured during procedures, surgeons and operating room staff will be able to get “performance analytics” with actionable assessments of their performance giving them the information needed to improve performance over time. We intend to establish a new standard of analytics to improve not only the skills of all surgeons but move towards best-practice-sharing that bridges the global surgeon community.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We continue the market development for and commercialization of the Senhance® Surgical System, which digitizes laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery, or MIS. The Senhance System is the first and only multi-port, digital laparoscopy platform designed to maintain laparoscopic MIS standards while providing digital benefits such as haptic feedback, robotic precision, comfortable ergonomics, advanced instrumentation including 3mm microlaparoscopic instruments, 5mm articulating instruments, eye-sensing camera control and fully-reusable standard instruments to help maintain per-procedure costs similar to traditional laparoscopy.

We believe that future outcomes of minimally invasive surgery will be enhanced through our combination of more advanced tools and robotic functionality which are designed to:
 

• | empower surgeons with improved precision, ergonomics, dexterity and visualization;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | offer high patient satisfaction and enable a desirable post-operative recovery; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide a cost-effective robotic system, compared to existing alternatives today, for a wide range of clinical applications and operative sites within the healthcare system.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our strategy is to focus on the market development, commercialization, and further development of the Senhance System. We further believe that:
 

• | laparoscopic robotic surgery will need to continue to evolve given the pressures of value-based healthcare and existing operating room inefficiencies, surgical variability, and workforce challenges;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | with the Senhance System, surgeons can benefit from the haptic feedback, enhanced three-dimensional, high definition, or 3DHD, vision, and open architecture consistent with current laparoscopic surgery procedures; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients will continue to seek a minimally invasive option, offering minimal scarring and fewer incisions, for many common general abdominal and gynecologic surgeries, which desires are addressed by the Senhance System.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Senhance System addresses these key challenges for laparoscopic surgeons and hospitals by delivering the benefits of robotics with improved control of the surgical field, enhanced visualization and camera control and improved ergonomics, coupled with the familiarity of laparoscopic motion and consistent per-procedure costs.
 
The Senhance System is available for sale in Europe, the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Russia and select other countries.
 

• | The Senhance System has a CE Mark in Europe for adult and pediatric laparoscopic abdominal and pelvic surgery, as well as limited thoracic surgeries excluding cardiac and vascular surgery.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the United States, we have 510(k) clearance from the FDA for use of the Senhance System in general laparoscopic surgical procedures and laparoscopic gynecologic surgery in a total of 31 indicated procedures, including benign and oncologic procedures, laparoscopic inguinal, hiatal and paraesophageal hernia, sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In Japan, we have received regulatory approval and reimbursement for 98 laparoscopic procedures.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Senhance System received its registration certificate by the Russian medical device regulatory agency, Roszdravnadzor, allowing for its sale and utilization throughout the Russian Federation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also enter into lease arrangements with certain qualified customers. For some lease arrangements, the customers are provided with the right to purchase the leased Senhance System during or at the end of the lease term (which we refer to as a Lease Buyout). In the first quarter of 2021, we completed one Lease Buyout of a Senhance System.
 
Our focus over the last few years has been on seeking regulatory approvals and clearances for the Senhance System and related product offerings and instruments and pursuing commercialization of our products. The following chart describes our success in achieving regulatory clearances and approvals to date.

On January 19, 2021, we announced that we received CE Mark for the ISU, allowing us to expand our augmented intelligence capabilities to all global areas accepting CE Marks. In addition, in August 2021, we received FDA clearance for expanded augmented intelligence features on the ISU. The ISU enables machine vision-driven control of the camera for a surgeon by responding to commands and recognizing certain objects and locations in the surgical fields and allows a surgeon to change the visualized field of view using the movement of their instruments. The newest ISU features expand upon these capabilities and introduce more advanced features including 3D measurement, digital tagging, image enhancement, and enhanced camera control based on real-time data from anatomical structures while performing surgery. We acquired the assets used in the development of the ISU as part of our October 2018 acquisition of the assets, intellectual property and highly experienced multidisciplinary personnel of Medical Surgical Technologies, Inc., or MST, an Israeli-based medical technology company.
 
On July 28, 2021, we announced that we received FDA clearance for 5mm diameter articulating instruments, offering better access to difficult-to-reach areas of the anatomy by providing two additional degrees of freedom. These instruments previously received CE Mark for use in the EU.
 
We also focused on expanding the indications for use of the Senhance System. As of March 2021, the Senhance System is FDA cleared for use in general laparoscopic surgical procedures and laparoscopic gynecologic surgery in a total of 31 indicated procedures, including benign and oncologic procedures, laparoscopic inguinal, hiatal and paraesophageal hernia, sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We continue to make additional submissions for clearance or approval for enhancements to the Senhance System and related instruments and accessories, including additional filings and approvals sought in Japan.
 
From our inception, we devoted a substantial percentage of our resources to research and development and start-up activities, consisting primarily of product design and development, clinical studies, manufacturing, recruiting qualified personnel and raising capital.  We expect to continue to invest in research and development and market development as we implement our strategy. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenue in order to achieve profitability. The Company operates in one business segment.

2021 Market Development Activities
 
In 2021 we continued to focus our resources and efforts on market development activities to increase awareness of:
 

• | the benefits of the use of the Senhance System in laparoscopic surgery;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the digitization of high volume procedures using the Senhance System;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the technical advancement of digital surgical tools to lead to the realization of Performance-Guided Surgery;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the indications for use, including pediatric indications of use in CE Mark territories; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the overall cost efficiency of the Senhance System.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 
We are focusing on markets with high utilization of laparoscopic techniques, including Japan, Western Europe and the United States. Our focus is on (1) increasing the number of placements of the Senhance System, not necessarily through sales, but through leasing arrangements, (2) increasing the number of procedures conducted using the Senhance System quarter over quarter, and (3) solidifying key opinion leader support and publications related to the use of the Senhance System in laparoscopic procedures. We are not currently focusing on revenue targets, especially in the United States.
 
2021 Senhance Surgical System Programs
 
We define the initiation of a Senhance Surgical program as entering into an agreement to purchase or lease, and subsequently utilize a Senhance Surgical System. Throughout 2021, we initiated ten Senhance System programs, one in the U.S., six in EMEA, and three in Asia. We initiated six Senhance System programs in the fourth quarter of 2021 alone.
Training Sites
 
In February 2021, we announced an agreement with the Amsterdam Skills Centre establishing the second European surgical training site for Senhance System Digital Laparoscopy. This site will serve surgeons and staff throughout Europe with basic and advanced training on the Senhance System. The Amsterdam Skills Centre will also provide Asensus with a world-class facility to engage European surgeons in technology and clinical development studies.
 
We now have six global training sites, including three in the United States at the Advent Health Nicholson Center in Celebration, Florida, at LSU Health’s University Medical Center New Orleans, and our office in Research Triangle Park North Carolina; two in Europe at Amsterdam Skills Center, and our office in Milan, Italy; and, one in Japan at Saitama Medical University International Medical Center in Tokyo.
 
Procedure Volumes
 In 2021, surgeons performed over 2,100 procedures utilizing the Senhance System, representing a 45% increase over the previous year, despite the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on elective surgeries and hospital operations. These procedures included general surgery, gynecology, urology, colorectal and bariatric surgical cases.
Foundational Sites
 Foundational sites are hospitals that are performing clinical procedures with the Senhance System at an annualized rate of greater than 100 procedures per year. The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on establishing sites, and training physicians, coupled with periodic suspension of elective surgeries by hospitals have impacted case volumes resulting in volatility in specific hospitals and regions. As we continue to emphasize the training and onboarding of new surgeon users and focus on increased utilization, we expect to see growth in foundational sites.
 
Performance-Guided Surgery (PGS)
 PGS builds upon the foundation of Digital Laparoscopy by adding machine vision, augmented intelligence, and deep learning capabilities to help guide improved decision making, enrich collaboration, and enhance predictability for all surgeons, independent of training or experience, to shift the promise of consistently superior surgery into practice.  Historical advances in surgery have largely focused on bringing tools and techniques into the OR to reduce the invasiveness of procedures and improve the execution of discrete tasks. Unlike many other industries, very little focus has been on improving the decision-making aspects of the surgical process, which is crucial in the high-pressure, highly variable situations which happen repeatedly during any surgery.  PGS focuses on a holistic solution for the entire surgeon workflow to drive consistently superior outcomes. We believe PGS can deliver real-time clinical decision support to boost surgeon capabilities to perceive complex environments, make decisions, and perform the desired tasks with increased precision, safety, and efficiency to mitigate surgical errors and complications.
 
Senhance Connect
 Senhance Connect is a mobile tool that allows surgeons in an operating room to connect with and communicate with other Senhance surgeons in other locations. The process allows for streaming of multiple camera views and an endoscopic view simultaneously, and allows for two-way screen sharing and annotation. This feature is part of our PGS ability to provide real-time digital collaboration capabilities to surgeons.

Clinical Validation
 
During 2021, there were 21 peer-reviewed clinical papers published providing further support of the clinical utility of the Senhance Surgical System across gynecology, general surgery, urology, and colorectal procedures demonstrating the utility breadth and the complexity of procedures being performed. In particular, there were four milestone papers published in 2021:

● | In April, a study was published comparing health economic outcomes of the Senhance System versus another robotic system, as well as traditional laparoscopy. According to the study, the Senhance System was less than half the median instrument cost compared to procedures performed on another robotic platform and was comparable to traditional laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy costs for certain gynecologic procedures.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In May, a study was published which analyzed the outcomes of over 800 Senhance System procedures across multiple specialties including hernia repairs, cholecystectomies, and prostatectomies based on data from the Company’s real-world clinical data registry, TRUST. According to the study, Senhance System procedures are safe and reproducible and deliver promising clinical outcomes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In August, a study was published which analyzed the outcomes and experience of utilizing the Senhance System to perform a high volume of urologic procedures. According to the study, the Senhance System is a safe and feasible platform to perform multiple common urologic procedures, namely upper urinary tract and extraperitoneal radical prostatectomies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In September, a study was published which analyzed the outcomes of inguinal hernia repair procedures based on data from the Company’s TRUST registry. According to the study, the Senhance System is a safe and doable platform to perform inguinal hernia repair procedures, and it can deliver high quality clinical outcomes related to patient recovery time, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Impact of COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on us in 2021 and continues to have a significant impact on our operations, primarily due to the continued repeated temporary cessation of elective surgical procedures in many markets, and the challenges and restrictions caused by stay-at-home orders, social distancing requirements and travel restrictions. Our business and customers were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which suspended many elective surgical procedures globally, curtailed travel and necessarily diverted the attention of hospital customers. A variety of travel restrictions have caused delays in product installation and training activities. This has significantly impacted our ability to implement our market development activities to place our Senhance Systems, provide training, and increase the use of the Senhance Systems in place. Given the dynamic nature of this health emergency, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ongoing business, results of operations and overall financial performance cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
 
Recent Financing Transactions
 
In 2021, we engaged in a number of equity financing transactions to fund our operations and extend our cash reach to provide capital to progress our strategy. These financings included:

● | January 2021 Public Offering. On January 29, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering of 26,545,832 shares of our common stock, including the underwriter’s full exercise of an over-allotment option on February 1, 2021, at the public offering price of $3.00 per share, generating net proceeds of approximately $73.4 million.

Market Overview
 
Over the past three decades, laparoscopic surgery has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative to open surgery. In laparoscopic surgery, multiple incisions are necessary to provide surgical access ports. Carbon dioxide gas insufflation is then used to create room in the body cavity, and long rigid instruments are introduced through ports placed in the incisions to perform surgical tasks. Millions of laparoscopic surgical procedures across a broad range of clinical applications are now performed each year worldwide, though many surgeries are still performed in an open fashion.
 
While laparoscopy has improved the invasive nature of many previously open procedures, it still has many limitations. Traditional, or rigid, laparoscopy still requires multiple incisions to achieve the visualization and instrument triangulation required to perform successful surgery. Rigid laparoscopy also creates physical challenges by forcing the surgeon’s hands and arms into awkward angles, requiring the surgeon to hold instruments in fixed positions for long periods of time and requiring an assistant to stabilize and move a laparoscopic camera. Another challenge associated with rigid laparoscopic surgery is the creation of a cumbersome and potentially tissue-damaging fulcrum at the patient’s abdominal wall where instruments are manipulated. Nearly all laparoscopic instruments are rigid instruments that lack internal articulation to enhance dexterity in complex tasks. Most laparoscopic surgeries are performed with two-dimensional, or 2-D, visualization of the operative field, making depth perception difficult.
 
Despite such limitations, traditional laparoscopy remains the prevalent technique in minimally invasive surgery. We believe that robotic devices that replicate laparoscopic motion are more comfortable for surgeons to adopt. Our Senhance System mimics laparoscopic surgery. We are uniquely focused on the laparoscopic surgical market as we believe it separates us from our competitors and allows surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgery in a method more comfortable for the patient than open surgery utilizing fully reusable tools, smaller instruments to broaden applicability of the laparoscopic method, including in pediatric cases, and to utilize the additional Senhance System technology such as the ISU.
 
Robotic and computer-controlled assistance have developed as technologies that offer the potential to improve upon many aspects of the laparoscopic surgical experience. According to DRG Global Market’s Laparoscopic Surgical Robotic Devices (October 2020), the existing laparoscopic market for soft tissue abdominal surgery is 16 million procedures annually. Initial widespread adoption of robotic-assisted surgery was focused on urologic and gynecologic procedures that were primarily performed in an open fashion prior to robotics, but more recently developed robotic approaches like the Senhance System have been applied to many other clinical applications, particularly in general surgery.
 
Despite recent advances and new entrants into the market, we believe there remain many limitations associated with current robotic-assisted surgery systems.
 
We digitize the surgical interface between the surgeon and the patient by providing a computer controller interface for the surgeon to manipulate surgical instruments and move the visualization system.  We believe image analytics technology will help accelerate and drive meaningful adoption of the Senhance System and allow us to expand the Senhance System capabilities to add augmented intelligence and reality vision capabilities.
 
The historical advances in surgery have largely focused on bringing tools and techniques into the operating room to reduce the invasiveness of procedures. When we introduced Digital Laparoscopy, our intention was to help surgeons minimize surgical variability in a cost-effective manner. The next step in the progress is looking for ways to deliver superior outcomes which we believe can be enabled by what we refer to as Performance-Guided Surgery.

Factors plaguing the healthcare industry that amplify the urgency for Performance-Guided Surgery include:
 

● | Value-based care is shifting a greater responsibility for poor quality and inefficiency to hospitals and physicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | COVID-19 exposed the financial frailty of the hospital system as well as capacity and resource constraints, which must be bolstered and requires an acceleration of innovation; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patients are presenting with more complex conditions and treating them becomes more complicated. The absolute number of patients seeking care is increasing, and many more patients have multiple chronic conditions than they did a generation, or even a decade ago.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These factors make it the ideal time to integrate advanced technology in the operating room.
 
Product Overview
 
We are addressing the challenges in laparoscopy and robotic-assisted surgery with technologically advanced products and product candidates that leverage the best features of both approaches to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS.
The Senhance Surgical System
 On September 18, 2015, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Sofar S.p.A., or Sofar, as seller, pursuant to which the Company acquired the Senhance System and related assets and personnel, or the Senhance Acquisition. The closing occurred on September 21, 2015. For a description of the Senhance Acquisition and related transactions, see the disclosure in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.
 
The Senhance System is a multi-port robotic surgery system that allows up to four arms to control robotic instruments and a camera. The system builds on the success of laparoscopy by enhancing the traditional features that surgeons have come to expect from existing products and by addressing some of the limitations associated with robotic surgery systems for laparoscopic procedures. The Senhance System also offers responsible economics to hospitals through its robotic technology coupled with reusable standard instruments that yield minimal additional costs per surgery when compared to laparoscopy. The Senhance System has a CE Mark in Europe for laparoscopic abdominal and pelvic surgery, as well as limited thoracic operations excluding cardiac and vascular surgery. In April 2017, the Company submitted a 510(k) submission to the FDA for the Senhance System. On October 13, 2017, the Company received 510(k) clearance for the Senhance System for use in laparoscopic colorectal and gynecologic surgery.  In May 2018, the indications for use expanded when we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for use of the Senhance System in laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery for a total of 28 indicated procedures.  During 2018 and early 2019, we successfully obtained FDA clearance and CE Mark for a number of instruments used with the Senhance System, as described further below. In February 2020, we received CE Mark for the Senhance System and related instruments for pediatric use indications in CE Mark territories. In March 2021, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for indication expansion in general surgery allowing for sleeve gastrectomy, and hiatal and paraesophageal hernia repair.
 
The Senhance System is commercially available in the United States, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, Russia and select other countries.

 The Senhance ultrasonic system is an advanced energy device used to deliver controlled energy to ligate and divide tissue, while minimizing thermal injury to surrounding structures.
 
In January 2020, we submitted a 510(k) submission to the FDA for our ISU, which is designed to enable machine vision capabilities on the Senhance System. The ISU was developed using the MST image analytics technology that we retained. On March 13, 2020, we announced that we had received FDA clearance for the ISU. On September 23, 2020, we announced the first surgical procedures successfully completed using the ISU. In January 2021, we received the CE Mark for the ISU and in September 2021 we received FDA clearance for additional augmented intelligence features of the ISU.
 
Indications for Use
 
We continue to work on expanding the indications for use of the Senhance System and our instruments and other products. The most notable recent advances are:

● | We received CE Mark approval for an expanded indication to treat pediatric patients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In 2020, we submitted an application to the FDA for 510(k) clearance for expanded General Surgery indications for use for the Senhance System. In March 2021, we received such clearance for hiatal and paraesophageal hernia, and sleeve gastrectomy procedures. These additional indications helped to increase procedure volume to over 2,100 cases in 2021.

Products in Development
 
Instruments
 In July 2021, we received FDA clearance for 5mm articulating instruments, which offer better access to difficult-to-reach areas of the anatomy. We are working on introducing other advanced instrumentation and functionality to the Senhance System.

Augmented Intelligence Assets with Global Use
 In September 2021, we announced that we had received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for an expansion of machine vision capabilities on the previously cleared ISU. The initial features of the ISU enable machine vision-driven control of the camera for a surgeon by responding to commands and recognizing certain objects and locations in the surgical field and allows a surgeon to change the visualized field of view using the movement of their instruments. The newest ISU features expanded upon these capabilities and introduced more advanced features including: real-time 3D measurement, digital tagging, image enhancement, and enhanced camera control based on real-time data from anatomical structures while performing surgery. In addition, we received a CE mark for the ISU in 2021, expanding its global use potential. We are currently working on additional enhancements to assist in Performance-Guided Surgery.

Sales and Marketing
 
We utilize distributors in jurisdictions where we do not sell directly.  Our distribution agreements typically provide exclusivity in a specific territory or jurisdiction.
 
We are dependent on growing the number of hospital customers and increasing the number of customers with installed Senhance Systems. Throughout 2021, we initiated ten Senhance surgical programs, one in the U.S., six in EMEA, and three in Asia. We define the initiation of a Senhance Surgical program as entering into an agreement to purchase or lease, and subsequently utilizing a Senhance Surgical System. We also focused on growing the number of foundational sites using the Senhance System.

Intellectual Property 
 
We believe that our intellectual property and expertise is an important competitive resource. Our experienced research and development team has created a substantial portfolio of intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We maintain an active program of intellectual property protection, both to assure that the proprietary technology developed by us is appropriately protected and, where necessary, to assure that there is no infringement of our proprietary technology by competitive technologies.
 
The following summarizes our current patent and patent application portfolio.
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s patent portfolio includes approximately 66 United States patents, over 100 patents issued outside the United States, and more than 150 patent applications filed in the United States and internationally.  We own all right, title and interest in all but the approximately 38 of our patents and patent applications that are exclusively licensed to us and the approximately 25 patents and patent applications that are non-exclusively licensed to us.
 
Several of our issued patents resulted from filings related to the Senhance System.  These include 8 United States patents, and approximately 40 patents outside the United States. The earliest to expire U.S. and non-U.S. patents within this part of our portfolio will remain in force until 2027.  The patent applications include over 120 that relate to the Senhance System or other features, instruments, or components for robotic-assisted surgery. Our patents and applications that we acquired from MST relate to image analytics and robotic surgery, among other things. We intend to continue to seek further patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and internationally, where available and when appropriate, as we continue our product development efforts.
 
Some of our issued patents and pending applications for the Senhance System, as well as associated technology and know-how, are exclusively licensed to Asensus Surgical Italia from the European Union. The license agreement with the European Union has a term which runs until the final licensed patent expires unless the agreement is terminated earlier by mutual consent of the parties, for the Company’s convenience, or for breach. The Company is currently in compliance with the terms of this license agreement.
 
Competition
 
Our industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than we do and have established reputations with our target customers, as well as worldwide distribution channels that are more established and developed than ours.
 
There were new entrants in the market for robotic surgery in 2021, and some forward steps by a number of existing entrants, such as the CE Mark attained by Medtronic for its Hugo™ robot. We believe that our focus on the laparoscopic market and our Performance-Guided Surgery initiative help us to remain competitive in this growing field.
 
There are many competitive offerings in the field of minimally invasive surgery. Several companies have launched devices that enable reduced incision or single incision laparoscopic surgery with or without robotic assistance.  Our surgical competitors include, but are not limited to: Johnson & Johnson/Verb Surgical Inc., Medtronic plc, Intuitive Surgical Inc., Titan Medical, Vicarious Surgical, Memic Innovative Surgery Ltd., Distalmotion SA, and CMR Surgical Ltd. We are aware that more entrants anticipate introducing additional robotic-based instruments in the next few years.
 
In addition to surgical device manufacturer competitors, there are many products and therapies designed to reduce the need for or attractiveness of surgical intervention. These products and therapies may impact the overall volume of surgical procedures and negatively impact our business.
 
Our ability to compete may be affected by the failure to fully educate physicians in the use of our products and products in development, or by the level of physician expertise. This may have the effect of making our products less attractive. We believe the Senhance System can be distinguished from other currently available robotic systems on the basis of (1) overall attractiveness to laparoscopic surgeons due to its ability to provide robotic benefits while leveraging their laparoscopic training and experience, (2) the additions we have made, including the ISU, (3) lower per procedure costs and (4) increasing indications for use, including pediatric indications. We further expect the Senhance System to differentiate in its ability to provide the surgeon with valuable tactile feedback and clinical intelligence to help guide better outcomes. Several medical device companies are actively engaged in research and development of robotic systems or other medical devices and tools used in minimally invasive surgery procedures. We cannot predict the basis upon which we will compete with new products marketed by others.

Government Regulation of our Product Development Activities
 
The U.S. government and foreign governments regulate the medical device industry through various agencies, including but not limited to, the U.S. FDA, which administers the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA. The design, testing, manufacturing, storage, labeling, distribution, advertising, and marketing of medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by similar agencies in other countries, including the European Union. Any device product that we develop must receive all requisite regulatory approvals or clearances, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country.
Device Development, Marketing Clearance and Approval
 
Medical devices are subject to varying levels of pre-market regulatory requirements. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes: (i) Class I devices are relatively simple and can be manufactured and distributed with general controls; (ii) Class II devices are somewhat more complex and receive greater scrutiny from the FDA and have heightened regulatory requirements; and (iii) Class III devices are new, high-risk devices, and frequently are permanently implantable or help sustain life and generally require a Pre-Market Approval, or PMA, by the FDA.
 
In the United States, a company generally can obtain permission to distribute a new medical device in one of two ways. The first applies to any device that is substantially equivalent to a device first marketed prior to May 1976, or to another device legally marketed after that date, but which is not subject to premarket approval (PMA) (described below). These devices are generally either Class I or Class II devices. To obtain FDA clearance to distribute the medical device, a company generally must submit a 510(k) notification and receive an FDA order finding substantial equivalence to a predicate device (pre-May 1976 device or post-May 1976 device is legally marketed and not subject to PMA) and permitting commercial distribution of that medical device for its intended use. A 510(k) notification must provide information supporting a claim of substantial equivalence to a single medical device, the predicate device, or multiple predicates in certain circumstances. If clinical data from human experience are required to support the 510(k) notification, these data must be gathered in compliance with the investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations for investigations performed in the United States. The 510(k) process is normally used for products of the type that we are developing and propose to market and sell. The FDA review process for premarket notifications submitted pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDCA takes, pursuant to statutory requirements, 90 days, but it can take substantially longer if the FDA has questions regarding the regulatory submission. It is possible for 510(k) clearance procedures to take from six to twelve months, depending on the concerns raised by the FDA and the complexity of the device. There is no guarantee that the FDA will “clear” a medical device for marketing, in which case the device cannot be distributed in the United States. There is also no guarantee that the FDA will deem the applicable device subject to the 510(k) process, as opposed to the more time-consuming and resource-intensive PMA process described below.
 
The second, more comprehensive, approval process applies to a new device that is not substantially equivalent to a predicate product or that is to be used in supporting or sustaining life or preventing impairment. These devices are normally Class III devices. For example, many implantable devices are subject to the approval process as a Class III device. Two steps of FDA approval are generally required before a company can market a product in the United States that is subject to PMA approval, as opposed to clearance, as a Class III device. First, a company must comply with IDE regulations in connection with any human clinical investigation of the device conducted in the United States. While the IDE regulations permit a company to undertake a clinical study of a “non-significant risk” device without formal FDA approval prior express FDA approval is required if the device is a significant risk device. Second, the FDA must approve the company’s PMA application, which typically contains, among other things, clinical information acquired under the IDE. Additionally, devices subject to PMA approval may be subject to an Advisory Panel review to obtain marketing approval and are required to pass a factory inspection in accordance with the current “good manufacturing practices” standards in order to obtain approval. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The PMA process takes substantially longer than the 510(k) process, approximately one to two years or more.
 
However, in some instances the FDA may find that a device is new and not substantially equivalent to a predicate device but is also not a high-risk device as is generally the case with Class III PMA devices. In these instances, the FDA may allow a device to be down classified from Class III to Class I or II. The de novo classification option is an alternate pathway to classify novel devices of low to moderate risk. A sponsor may submit a de novo classification request to the FDA for novel low to moderate risk devices without first being required to submit a 510(k) submission. These types of applications are referred to as “Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation” or “de novo request.” In instances where a low to moderate risk device is deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the candidate device may be filed under a de novo request. FDA review of a de novo request may lead the FDA to identify the device as either a Class I or II device subject to the 510(k) regulatory pathway. Review times for de novo requests vary widely, and may take in excess of one year.
 
The Company believes the Senhance System and many related products are Class II devices as evidenced by the Company’s cleared 510(k) premarket notifications. The Company intends to further develop the product line by adding additional instrumentation to and expanding the capabilities of the Senhance System.  At this time, the Company believes that the items under development are Class II devices subject to 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA might find that the 510(k) submission does not provide the evidence required to prove that the additional instruments or accessories for use with the Senhance System are substantially equivalent to marketed Class II devices. If that were to occur, the Company would be required to undertake the more complex and costly PMA process or perhaps be considered for a de novo reclassification. For either the 510(k), de novo, or the PMA process, the FDA could require the Company to conduct clinical trials, which would take more time, cost more money and pose other risks and uncertainties. The Company does not believe it has any need to, and is not currently planning to conduct, any clinical trials.
 
    14 

  

If needed in the future, clinical studies conducted in the United States or used in any U.S. application on an unapproved medical device that presents a significant risk require approval from the FDA prior to initiation. Even when a clinical study has been approved by the FDA or deemed approved, the study is subject to factors beyond a sponsor's control, including, but not limited to, the fact that the institutional review board, or IRB, at a specified clinical site might not approve the study, might decline to renew approval, or might suspend or terminate the study before its completion. There is no assurance that a clinical study at any given site will progress as anticipated. In addition, there can be no assurance that the clinical study will provide sufficient evidence to assure the FDA that the product is safe and effective, a prerequisite for FDA approval of a PMA, or substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a predicate device, a prerequisite for clearance under Section 510(k). Even if the FDA approves or clears a device, it may limit its intended uses in such a way that manufacturing and distribution of the device may not be commercially feasible.
 
After clearance or approval to market is given, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, upon the occurrence of certain serious adverse events, are authorized under various circumstances to withdraw the clearance or approval of the device, or require changes to a device, its manufacturing process or its labeling or require additional proof that regulatory requirements have been met.
 
A manufacturer of a device approved through the PMA process is not permitted to make changes to the device which affect its safety or effectiveness without first submitting a supplement application to its PMA and obtaining FDA approval for that supplement, prior to marketing the modified device. In some instances, the FDA may require clinical trials to support a supplement application. A manufacturer of a device cleared through the 510(k) process must submit an additional premarket notification if it intends to make a change or modification in the device that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, such as a significant change or modification in design, material, chemical composition, energy source, labeling or manufacturing process. A change in the intended uses of a PMA device or a 510(k) device generally requires an approval supplement or newly cleared premarket notification or de novo request. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported, as well as certain FDA export requirements.
 
Continuing Regulation
 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | quality system regulations that require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, process control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations that prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved, i.e. “off label,” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulations that require manufacturers to report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | corrections and removal reporting regulations that require manufacturers to report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements to conduct post-market surveillance studies to establish continued safety data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are required to, and have, registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer. We must obtain all necessary permits and licenses to operate our business in all regions in which we do business. As manufacturers, we and our suppliers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and other regulations.
 
In Europe, we comply with the requirements of the 93/42/EEC Medical Devices Directive, or MDD, and appropriately affix the CE Mark on our products to attest to such compliance. Asensus Surgical Italia S.r.l. is the legal manufacturer in the European Union. Our products marketed in the EU meet the “Essential Requirements” of the MDD relating to safety and performance. We have undergone verification of our regulatory compliance, or conformity assessment, by a Notified Body duly authorized by an EU country and must continue to do so as new products and changes to the products arise. The level of scrutiny of such assessment depends on the regulatory class of the product. We are subject to continued surveillance by our Notified Body and are required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities. We also must comply with additional requirements of individual countries in which our products are marketed. In the European Union, we are required to maintain certain quality system certifications in order to sell products. These regulations require us or our manufacturers to manufacture products and maintain documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing, labeling and control activities.  As legal manufacturers, we and our suppliers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the European Notified Bodies and Competent Authorities.
 
    15 

  

In May 2021, the Medical Device Directive was replaced by the updated European Medical Device Regulation, or 2017/745 (MDR), after a four-year transition period.   However, any of our products that were certified to comply with the MDD have been or will have to be re-evaluated by a designated Notified Body according to the new regulations after their certificates expire or in case of a substantial change.  The new regulations place new requirements regarding labeling, post-market surveillance, and technical documentation on all medical device manufacturers.  In addition, Notified Bodies underwent the transition as well, leading to reduced capacity to take on new clients or review new medical devices for CE Mark approvals or existing medical devices for substantial changes.  Transition to the new regulations will take time and resources from our internal personnel and external consultants to gain compliance, which may reduce the resources available for market expansion and new product introductions.
 
Impact of Regulation
 
Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA and other international regulatory bodies, which may include, among other things, any of the following sanctions:

• | warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | repair, replacement, refund or seizure of our products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing our request for market access approvals of new products or modifications to existing products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing or suspending clearances or approvals that are already granted;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution; and
--+--------------------------


• | disgorgement of profits.
--+-------------------------

 
Further, the levels of revenues and profitability of medical device companies like us may be affected by the continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of products is subject to governmental control. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental controls.
 
Therefore, we cannot assure you that any of our products will be considered cost effective, or that, following any commercialization of our products, coverage and reimbursement will be available or sufficient to allow us to manufacture and sell them competitively and profitably.
 
Health Care Regulation
 
Our business activities are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician payment transparency laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 
In the United States, there have been, and we expect there to continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives, at both the federal and state government levels, to change the healthcare system in ways that, if approved, could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. At the current time, our products are not defined as durable medical equipment. Non-DME devices used in surgical procedures are normally paid directly by the hospital or health care provider and not reimbursed separately by third-party payors. Instead, the hospital or health care provider is reimbursed based on the procedure performed and the inpatient or outpatient stay. As a result, these types of devices are subject to intense price competition that can place a small manufacturer at a competitive disadvantage as hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and health care providers attempt to negotiate lower prices for products such as the ones we develop and sell.
 
    16 

  

In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Affordable Care Act, and the reconciliation law known as Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Reconciliation Act, and, with the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, were enacted into law. With the recent change in federal administration, the Company cannot predict with certainty the long-term impact of federal health care legislation on its business.
 
The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation includes the Open Payments Act (formerly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act), which, in conjunction with its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of certain drugs, biologics, and devices that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually certain payments or “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. We have provided reports under the Open Payments Act to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services since 2014. Amendments to the Open Payments Act expanded the categories of health care providers for which reporting is required.  The failure to report appropriate data accurately, timely, and completely could subject us to significant financial penalties. Other countries and several states currently have similar laws and more may enact similar legislation.
 
International Regulation and Potential Impact
 
The Company has market development and commercial activities in a number of international markets and intends to focus on such markets in the near term. Some of these markets maintain unique regulatory requirements outside of or in addition to those of the FDA and the European Union. The Senhance System is CE Marked, which is the basis to allow us to offer the product for sale in a number of jurisdictions, including select countries in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.  Due to the variations in regulatory requirements within territories, the Company may be required to perform additional safety or clinical testing or fulfill additional agency requirements for specific territories. The Company may also be required to apply for registration using third parties within those territories and may be dependent upon the third parties’ successful regulatory processes to file, register and list the product applications and associated labeling, which could lead to significant investments and resource use. These additional requirements may result in delays in international registrations and commercialization of our products in certain countries.
 
In addition, we are utilizing distributors and sales agents in various territories throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Commonwealth of Independent States, and need to ensure that our activities, and the activities of our distributors and sales agents, are compliant with local law and U.S. laws governing the sales of medical devices.  We have also established subsidiaries and contracted with third parties in Asia, including Japan and Taiwan, to seek regulatory approvals to offer our products in Asia.  The laws governing the registration, approval, clearance, and sales of medical devices, such as the Senhance System, in multiple jurisdictions are complex, and the failure to comply with such laws in any given jurisdiction could subject us to financial penalties or suspension or termination of our ability to sell our products in the applicable jurisdiction.
 
Environmental, Social and Governance
 
Environmental
 
As a company, we are committed to encouraging and fostering sustainable practices to support the global environment. We comply with environmental regulations in each of our locations. We have a corporate goal of limiting the use of plastic with paper cups and recyclable materials and, prior to COVID, adopted a no plastic policy in our Milan office, which was interrupted due to the need for single-use packaging for health concerns during COVID. Our employees located in our European facilities are encouraged to travel by train rather than aircraft, and some employees benefit from local government incentives to use electric cars. We also put safety first in our locations. Our employees at our manufacturing facility in Italy follow mandatory safety training and take mandatory vision tests and a check-up by the occupational doctor every five years; we also have safety procedures which are drafted with assistance from a third-party safety consultant and updated twice a year. 
Social
 
Company Culture
 Our employees are passionate about the work they do and thrive in a collaborative environment that fosters creative solutions to complex problems. The Company fosters a significant amount of collaboration and synergy among employees. Team members at any level are encouraged to provide suggestions and input to enable the Company’s success.
Employee Demographics 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 167 employees, including 153 full-time employees, of whom 55 were in the R&D department, 15 were in Quality and Regulatory Affairs, 34 were in marketing and sales, 29 were in Corporate Administration, and 20 were in Customer Care. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 33% of the Company’s workforce were female, and minorities represented approximately 24% of the Company’s workforce. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 58% of the Company’s employees were  in the United States and 42% were outside of the United States. In 2021, our turnover rate was approximately 18% and we hired 48 full-time employees.

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DEI”)
 We believe in contributing to a society that welcomes diverse voices and values differences in lived experiences, culture, religion, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, and neurodiversity. We are committed to ensuring this same environment for our employees – a culture where individuals feel safe, heard, and respected. We celebrate the uniqueness of our global workforce, especially in a company of our size, and appreciate that only through inclusion, ongoing learning, and partnership can we succeed.
 
In 2020, we created an internal webpage dedicated to diversity, equity and inclusion (or DEI) resources for our employees, kicked off a DEI committee and partnered with a DEI alliance to further evolve our DEI efforts. In 2021, we launched e-learning modules hosted by a third-party to provide our employees with education and training on DEI topics. We are also focused on incorporating DEI principles into our governance structure and believe having mix of backgrounds and experience in our Board composition is essential to understanding and reflecting the needs of our diverse stakeholders. Currently, two of eight board members self-identify as women, and three of our eight Board members self-identify as individuals from underrepresented communities (defined as an individual who self-identifies as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Alaska Native, or who self-identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender).
 
COVID-19 Pandemic
 Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, employee safety is of top priority. Until August 2021, most of our employees globally worked from home since the beginning of the pandemic, except for those with a business need to engage in work onsite. Beginning in August 2021, we encouraged a return to the office on a hybrid basis, while monitoring the ongoing impact of the pandemic on our office locations. Ongoing safety measures remain in place at each of our locations including implementing pre-screening and social distancing requirements in addition to providing PPE. Our Global Prevention Team continues to monitor the impact of the pandemic on our global workforce and to carry out our ongoing planning and response efforts. We increased our employee communications to ensure frequent connections while working remotely across the company including regular all-hands meetings and employee newsletters.
Health & Wellness 
 Throughout 2021, health and wellness was a key focus of the Company, especially in light of the ongoing pandemic and new variants. Many of our employee communications focused on the physical and mental health of our employees. We remain committed to providing our workforce with flexible remote working schedules to suit their personal needs through this challenging time. We also continue to benchmark all of our health insurance offerings to ensure plan competitiveness.
People Strategy
 Our People Strategy is to create and maintain a culture of high performance and accountability through the attraction, retention and development of expert talent. To enhance our employees’ satisfaction and retention, we offer ongoing training opportunities that support professional growth. We have an annual performance review process for all employees worldwide to review performance and inform compensation recommendations. We compete for top talent with effective recruitment strategies, well defined roles and attractive total compensation packages. We keep talent engaged through appreciation, communication and creation of a great work environment. We support employee growth professionally and personally through formal and informal opportunities and leadership support.
Employee Engagement 
 We partner with Gallup, Inc, a global analytics and advice firm, to monitor and improve the engagement of our workforce. Gallup’s Q12 survey measures employee engagement based on twelve key needs of employees. We utilize survey results to identify strengths and weaknesses and create action plans to improve engagement and ultimately team performance. In 2021, we saw an increase in our engagement score over the prior year. We continue to incorporate Gallup’s programs into our overall People Strategy. 
Compensation
 In addition to competitive base salaries, we offer incentive-based compensation programs tied to the performance of key objectives. We also provide compensation in the form of retention grants of restricted stock units and/or stock options, which we believe help align longer term employee incentives with our company performance. Ensuring fair and equitable pay is also an important commitment we make to our employees.
Governance
 
Our Board of Directors, through its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, evaluates the governance and management practices of the Company. We believe our corporate governance guidelines and structure provide our stockholders with a dedicated, qualified and skilled board of directors and management team. Our governance structure includes:

● | annual elections of all board members; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | an independent Board chair and separation of the CEO/Chair role; 
● | diversity in skills, gender and ethnicity in our board and management team; 
● | the addition of two new board members in 2021 and transition of our Board chair; and 
● | the ability of stockholder to propose candidates for potential nomination to the board and proposals for consideration by stockholders at annual meetings.

ITEM 1.A. | RISK FACTORS
----------+-------------

 
Our risk factors are grouped into the following categories: (1) Risks Related to the Operation of our Business; (2) Risks Related to Our Status as a Public Company; (3) Risks Related to Protection of our Intellectual Property; (4) Risks Related to the Regulation of our Business; and (5) General Risk Factors.
 
Risks Related to the Operation of our Business
 
We have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.
 We have a limited operating history. We are not profitable and have incurred losses since our inception. Our accumulated deficit was $785.4 million and our working capital was $103.4 million as of December 31, 2021. We believe that cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and long-term investments, including proceeds from our capital raising transactions in 2021 and the warrant exercises are sufficient to fund our operations for more than 12 months.
 
We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses will likely increase as we continue to develop and commercialize our products. We will continue to incur research and development and general and administrative expenses related to our operations, and sales and marketing expenses to support our commercial activities, as restructured. Even if we are successful in reducing our expenses or achieving profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. 
 
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively impacted our operations.
 We have facilities located in the United States, Israel, Japan, and Italy. All of our facilities are in locations that are subject to, or have been subject to, travel restrictions, stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, or return-to-work on a hybrid basis. Our Senhance Systems are manufactured at a contract manufacturing facility in Milan. A variety of travel restrictions, caused delays in our product installation and training activities in 2021, particularly in the second quarter. Elective surgeries have also been curtailed a number of times during variant surges in 2021 in various parts of the globe. Although such procedures have recommenced in large part, the limits on elective procedures significantly impacted our ability to place our Senhance Systems, provide training, and increase the use of the Senhance Systems in place. It is uncertain whether elective surgeries will continue to be negatively impacted or halted again in the future by a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in any of these jurisdictions.
 
The global spread of COVID-19 and the various attempts to contain it continue to create significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it impacts our business, operations and financial results continues to depend on numerous factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including new variants; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the availability and cost to access the capital markets; the decline in elective surgery procedures; the effect on our customers and customer demand for Senhance Systems and the ability to provide training services; disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work and travel; and shortages of certain supplies and materials. In addition, any preventative or protective actions that governments implement or that we take in respect of COVID-19, such as travel restrictions or stay-at-home orders, may interfere with the ability of our employees, vendors and contract manufacturers to perform their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business. Such results could have a material adverse effect on our operations, business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
 
    19 

  

We believe the COVID-19 pandemic, including emerging variant strains of the virus, will continue to negatively impact our operations and our ability to implement our market development efforts, which will have a negative effect on our financial condition. There is a risk that government actions will not be effective at containing further COVID-19 outbreaks, including from variants, and that government actions, including the orders and restrictions described above, that are intended to contain the spread of COVID-19 will have a devastating negative impact on the world economy at large, in which case the risks to our sales, operating results and financial condition described herein would be elevated significantly.
 
Our strategic focus, on delivering tools and assistance to provide Performance-Guided Surgery opportunities, may not result in the growth of our business in the timeline we envision or at all.
 On February 23, 2021, we announced a strategic focus on providing clinical intelligence to surgeons to provide Performance-Guided Surgery opportunities. We believe that the Senhance System, which digitizes the interface between the surgeon and the patient in laparoscopic surgery can also be used, with our augmented intelligence offerings, to provide real-time clinical data throughout the entire surgical experience, assist in removing elements and factors that contribute to surgical variability and reduce complications. Our efforts to communicate and implement this strategy with hospitals, surgery centers and surgeons may take longer than we anticipate, may not be as successful as we contemplate and may not result in a meaningful increase in our business or financial condition.
 
We are currently highly dependent on a single product, the Senhance System.  We cannot give any assurance that the Senhance System can be successfully commercialized.
 We are currently highly dependent on the Senhance System, which is FDA cleared for sale in the United States, CE Marked for sale in the European Union and other countries, registered for sale in the Russian Federation, and approved for sale and reimbursement in Japan. We began our selling efforts for the Senhance System in the fourth quarter of 2015 in Europe, in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the United States, in the second quarter of 2018 in Asia and, through distributors in the Russian Federation in 2021.  We have had limited commercial success to date, particularly in 2019 and 2020. We have determined to focus our energies on market development and increased usage of the Senhance Systems that have been purchased and placed, as well as on our Performance-Guided Surgery strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully improve the commercialization of the Senhance System, for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, failure in our market development and sales efforts, the long sales cycle associated with the purchase of capital equipment, and the potential introduction by our competitors of more clinically effective or cost-effective alternatives.  Failure to successfully commercialize the Senhance System would have a material and adverse effect on our business.
 
The sales cycle for the Senhance System has been lengthy and unpredictable, leading us to refocus our energies on entering into placement and leasing arrangements with hospitals, which has had an impact on our revenue.
 Purchase of a surgical robotic system such as the Senhance System represents a capital purchase by hospitals and other potential customers, which is a time-intensive process involving adoption by surgeons and approval of the capital purchase by administration. We are also expanding the potential market for robotic surgical systems with our focus on laparoscopic surgery.  Such expansion requires a different sales and marketing approach than a focus on open procedures.  We have found that sales are extremely difficult and take substantial effort. In late 2019, we began leasing Senhance Systems to hospitals with lease terms ranging from twelve to twenty-four months or more. In 2021 we initiated ten Senhance Systems programs. We cannot assure you that these lease arrangements will lead to longer term placements or result in sales of our Senhance System.
 
We currently have limited marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. We are focusing on market development efforts and have curtailed our sales force in the United States, and are focusing on select countries in Europe, the Russian Federation and in Japan. Sales efforts in certain of these countries are conducted through the use of independent contractor and distribution agreements with companies possessing established sales and marketing operations in the medical device industry.  There can be no assurance that we will be successful in building our sales capabilities after this period of market development. With respect to future sales in the Russian Federation, we are monitoring geo-political events and assessing whether the implementation of sanctions may result in our inability to conduct future sales in the Russian Federation through our distributors or at all.  Any such disruption in our sales efforts could have an adverse impact on our financial results. To the extent that we enter into additional distribution, co-promotion or other arrangements, our product revenue is likely to be lower than if we directly market or sell our products. In addition, any revenue we receive will depend in whole or in part upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful and are generally not within our control. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. If we are not successful in commercializing our existing and future products, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.
 
We have procedures in place to require our distributors and sales agents to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the sales of medical devices in the jurisdictions where they operate.  Failure to meet such requirements could subject us to financial penalties or the suspension or termination of the ability to sell our products in such jurisdiction.  
 
    20 

  

The surgical robotics industry is increasingly competitive, which can negatively impact our commercial opportunities. 
 The medical device industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many companies that are researching and marketing products designed to address minimally invasive and robotic-assisted surgery, including new entrants in the competitive market. We are currently commercializing the Senhance System in the United States with FDA 510(k) clearance, in Europe which accepts a CE Mark, the Middle East, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and selected countries in Asia. We face significant competition in such markets. Many of our competitors, including Intuitive Surgical, have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and product development resources than we do. Some of the medical device companies we compete with or expect to compete with include Johnson & Johnson/Verb Surgical Inc., Medtronic plc, Intuitive Surgical Inc., Titan Medical, Vicarious Surgical, Memic Innovative Surgery Ltd., Distalmoton SA, and CMR Surgical Ltd. and a number of minimally invasive surgical device and robotic surgical device manufacturers and providers of products and therapies that are designed to reduce the need for or attractiveness of surgical intervention. In addition, many other universities and private and public research institutions are or may become active in research involving surgical devices for minimally invasive and robotic-assisted surgery.
 
We are also expanding the potential market for robotic surgical systems with our focus on laparoscopic surgery. Such expansion may lead to additional competition with companies with sufficiently higher resources than ours. We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:
 

● | the efficacy, safety and reliability of our products;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to commercialize and market our cleared or approved products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the completion of our development efforts and receipt of regulatory clearance or approval for instruments and accessories to support the use of the Senhance System;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the cost of ownership and use of our products in relation to alternative devices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the timing and scope of regulatory clearances or approvals, including any expansion of the indications of use for our products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | whether our competitors substantially reduce the cost of ownership and use of an alternative device;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to protect and defend intellectual property rights related to our products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to have our partners manufacture and sell commercial quantities of any cleared or approved products to the market;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors for the procedures in which our products are used;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | acceptance of future products by physicians and other health care providers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If our competitors market products that are more effective, safer, easier to use or less expensive than our products or future products, or that reach the market sooner than our products, we may not achieve commercial success. In addition, the medical device industry is characterized by rapid technological change. It may be difficult for us to stay abreast of the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or products obsolete or less competitive.
 
We anticipate that the highly competitive surgical robotics environment can lead our competitors to attempt to slow or derail our commercial progress. We are using our best efforts to enter the commercial markets effectively and efficiently while maintaining compliance with all regulatory and legal requirements. Responding to the actions of our competitors will require the attention of our management and may distract the management team from its focus on our commercial operations and lead to increased costs of commercialization, which could have a negative impact on our financial position.
 
We also anticipate that the competitive surgical robotics environment will become more intense because of increased consolidation by companies in the health care industry looking to achieve cost reductions. Such consolidation may have an adverse effect on our business operations.
 
Negative publicity, whether true or not, concerning us or our products could reduce market acceptance of our products and could result in decreased demand for the Senhance System.
 There have been social media and other publications regarding us and the Senhance System published from time to time since we started selling the Senhance System. Negative media and social media coverage, whether true or not, concerning our products or us could reduce market acceptance of the Senhance System and increase volatility in our stock price.
 
    21 

  

In order to compete successfully within the surgical robotics industry, we need to continue to evolve the Senhance System, including the innovations associated with assets we acquired.  Failure to develop, seek regulatory approval for and commercialize such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.
 In order to compete successfully within the highly competitive surgical robotics industry, we need to continue to advance and innovate the Senhance System, including the innovations associated with the assets we acquired from Medical Surgery Technologies, Ltd., or MST, in 2018.  Our focus currently is on harnessing the image technology acquired in the MST acquisition to advance the intelligence of the Senhance System through the ISU to provide meaningful real-time data to surgeons.  We have developed and received CE Mark for articulating instruments in Europe and FDA clearance in the U.S. These assets are also vital to our Performance-Guided Surgery strategy. If we fail to continue to develop such innovations, or fail to obtain regulatory approval or clearance for or successfully commercialize such innovations, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.
 
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.
 We conduct operations in several different countries, including the United States and throughout Europe, and portions of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, and other currencies. Since our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. We have not historically hedged our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.  Accordingly, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and other currencies could materially affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.
 
Our global operations expose us to additional risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.
 The international nature of our business, particularly in Europe, Israel, Asia and the Russian Federation, may expose us to risks inherent in conducting foreign operations. These risks include:
 

● | challenges associated with managing geographically diverse operations, which require an effective organizational structure and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the high cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions, if we chose to do so in the future;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic environment;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by U.S. or non-U.S. governments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potentially adverse tax consequences;
--+--------------------------------------


● | complexities and difficulties in obtaining protection and enforcing our intellectual property;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with additional regulations and government authorities in a highly regulated business;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | difficulties associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including differing labor relations; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | general economic and political conditions outside of the U.S.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The risks that we face in our international operations may continue to intensify as we further develop and expand our international operations.
 
We may require substantial additional funding to advance our current plans.
 We are focused on our market development efforts and commercialization of the Senhance System and other products, as well as research and development activities for advancements for the Senhance System and our other products. We intend to advance multiple additional products through clinical and pre-clinical development in the future. We will need to raise additional capital in the future in order to fund these priorities and achieve our business objectives. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining additional financing in the future on terms acceptable to the Company or at all.
 
    22 

  

Until we generate a sufficient amount of revenue to finance our cash requirements, which may never occur, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or strategic collaborations. We do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution; and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that limit our operations. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our products or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
 
We expect our gross margins to vary over time, and changes in our gross margins could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
 We began selling the Senhance System in 2015.  Our gross margins have fluctuated from period to period, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. Our gross margins have been and may continue to be adversely affected by numerous factors, including: service costs, changes in customer, geographic or product mix; the number of Senhance Systems sold vs. placed, our ability to maintain or reduce production costs, changes in production volume driven by demand for our products, changes in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs, including increases in costs relating to global supply shortages and inflation, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for foreign-currency denominated costs, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes to U.S. and foreign trade policies, including the enactment of tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., inventory obsolescence and product recall charges and market conditions.
 
If we are unable to offset the unfavorable impact of the factors noted above by increasing the volume of products shipped, reducing product manufacturing costs or otherwise, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.
 
We face risks arising from sole suppliers of components and our ability to meet delivery schedules for sales of our products. 
 The Senhance System is manufactured for us under contract by a third-party manufacturer. We or our manufacturer acquire raw materials and components of the Senhance System from vendors, some of which are sole suppliers. Although we believe that we have the manufacturing capacity and inventory reserves to meet our anticipated Senhance System sales for the foreseeable future, we are currently taking steps to develop redundant manufacturing and supply alternatives. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing these redundant supply and manufacturing capabilities. If we are not successful, our business operations could suffer.
 
Our products require precise, high-quality manufacturing. We and our contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities to ensure strict compliance with the quality systems regulations, current “good manufacturing practices” and other applicable government regulations and corresponding standards. If we or our contract manufacturers fail to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in compliance with QSR, we may experience manufacturing errors resulting in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or interruptions of production or failures in product testing or delivery, delay or prevention of filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business.
 
Global supply shortages may prevent or restrict our ability to purchase adequate supplies of materials, parts and components at acceptable prices, which could result in delivery delays for our products or increases in our manufacturing costs.
 A disruption or termination in the supply of components could result in our inability to meet demand for our products, which could harm our ability to generate revenues, lead to customer dissatisfaction, and damage our reputation and our brand. Furthermore, if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of our products, we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The time and processes associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture our products on schedule or within budget, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, our ability to meet customers’ demands depends, in part, on our ability to timely obtain an adequate delivery of quality materials, parts, and components from our suppliers. Any such supply shortage could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
 
Labor shortages may disrupt our operations and result in delays in the manufacture and delivery of our products.
 Increased labor shortages globally, including staff burnout and attrition, could also impact our ability to hire and retain personnel critical to our manufacturing, logistics, and commercial operations. We are also highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to our success, and competition for them has become more intense. The loss of critical members of our team, or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, could significantly harm our operations, business, and ability to compete. In addition, hospitals are also experiencing staffing shortages and supply chain issues that could impact their ability to provide patient care.
 
The inflationary environment could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.
 Changes in economic conditions and supply chain constraints and steps taken by governments and central banks, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other stimulus and spending programs, could lead to higher inflation than previously experienced or expected, which could, in turn, lead to an increase in costs. An inflationary environment could have a negative impact on our expenses, increase our labor costs and reduce our available cash flow.
 
    23 

  

Because our design, development and manufacturing capabilities are limited, we rely on third parties to design, develop, manufacture or supply some of our products. An inability to find additional or alternate sources for these services and products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 We have used third-party design and development sources to assist in the design and development of our medical device products. In the future, we may choose to use additional third-party sources for the design and development of our products. If these design and development partners are unable to provide their services in the timeframe or to the performance level that we require, we may not be able to establish a contract and obtain a sufficient alternative supply from another supplier on a timely basis and in the manner that we require.
 
Natural disasters and the effects of climate change could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.
 The effects of climate change, weather or other events could adversely impact our supply chain, including our ability to manufacture our products, source materials or components or services from suppliers (including sole-source suppliers) that are needed for such manufacturing (including sterilization), or provide products to our customers, including events that impact key distributors. Natural disasters, including the impacts of climate change, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, fires, earthquakes and floods and other extreme weather events, global health pandemics, war, terrorism, labor disruptions and international conflicts that could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability, could result in decreased demand for our products, or adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or cause interruptions in our supply chain.
 
Our operations, and the activities of our customers, vendors or distributors, could be disrupted by climate change. The physical changes caused by climate change may prompt changes in regulations or consumer preferences which in turn could have negative consequences for our and our customers’ businesses. Potential physical risks from climate change may include altered distribution and intensity of rainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased frequency of wildfires and other natural disasters, rising sea levels, and a rising heat index, any of which could cause negative impacts to our and our customers’ businesses. If such events affect our customers’ businesses, they may purchase fewer of our products, and our revenues may be negatively impacted.
 
There has been a broad range of proposed and promulgated state, national and international regulations aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. Such regulations could result in additional costs to maintain compliance and additional income or other taxes. Climate change regulations continue to evolve, and it is not possible to accurately estimate potential future compliance costs.
 
Risks Related to Our Status as a Public Company
 
Our stock price has been volatile and may experience additional volatility and fluctuation in the future.
The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the market price of our common stock could decrease and could cause you to lose some or all of your investment in our common stock.  During the two-year period ended December 31, 2021, the market price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $6.32 per share to a low of $0.29 per share. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as

● | the announcement of favorable or unfavorable news regarding us, including our product development efforts and regulatory clearance activities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the achievement of lease placements or commercial sales of our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the announcement of new products or product enhancements or collaborations by us or our competitors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the success of our Performance-Guided Surgery initiative;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | variations in our and our competitors’ results of operations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | developments in surgical robotics;
--+-----------------------------------


● | future issuances of common stock or other securities;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | the addition or departure of key personnel;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    24 

  

Our stockholders have experienced dilution of their percentage ownership of our stock and may experience additional dilution in the future.
 We have raised significant capital through the issuance of our common stock and warrants and anticipate that we may need to raise substantial additional capital in order to continue our operations and achieve our business objectives. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors in previous offerings, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share in previous offerings. The future issuance of the Company’s equity securities will further dilute the ownership of our outstanding common stock.  The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, and such volatility could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease and could cause you to lose some or all of your investment in our common stock.
 
We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and any return to investors is expected to come, if at all, only from potential increases in the price of our common stock.
 At the present time, we intend to use available funds to finance our operations. Accordingly, while payments of dividends is within the discretion of our board of directors, no cash dividends on our common stock have been declared or paid by us, and we have no intention of paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future. Any return to investors is expected to come, if at all, only from potential increases in the price of our common stock.  
 
Risks Related to Protection of our Intellectual Property
 
Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 Other entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale or import products or impair our competitive position. In addition, to the extent that a third-party develops new technology that covers our products, we may be required to obtain licenses to that technology, which licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, we will not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities, unless we challenge the validity, enforceability or infringement of the third-party patent or circumvent the third-party patent, which would be costly and would require significant time and attention of our management. Third parties may have or obtain valid and enforceable patents or proprietary rights that could block us from developing products using our technology. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we require may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
If we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings related to a determination of rights, we could incur substantial costs and expenses, substantial liability for damages or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts, any of which could materially adversely affect our liquidity, business prospects and results of operations.
 
Third parties may sue us for infringing their patent rights. Likewise, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of proprietary rights of others. In addition, a third-party may claim that we have improperly obtained or used its confidential or proprietary information. Furthermore, in connection with our third-party license agreements, we generally have agreed to indemnify the licensor for costs incurred in connection with litigation relating to intellectual property rights. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and the litigation would divert our management’s efforts. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than us because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations.
 
If any parties successfully claim that our creation or use of proprietary technologies infringes upon their intellectual property rights, we might be forced to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed on such parties’ patent rights. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, a court could require us to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license. Any license required under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, such licenses are likely to be non-exclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively market some of our technology and products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations.
 
For our Senhance System, we rely on our license from the European Union, and any loss of our rights under such license agreement, or failure to properly prosecute, maintain or enforce the patent applications underlying such license agreement, could materially adversely affect our business prospects for the Senhance System. 
 Some of the patents and patent applications in our patent portfolio related to the Senhance System are licensed to Asensus Surgical Italia S.r.l. under a license agreement with the European Union. Presently, we rely on such licensed technology for our Senhance System products and may license additional technology from the European Union or other third parties in the future. The EU license agreement gives us rights for the commercial exploitation of the licensed patents, patent applications and know-how, subject to certain provisions of the license agreement. Failure to comply with these provisions could result in the loss of our rights under the EU license agreement. Our inability to rely on these patents and patent applications which are the basis of certain aspects of our Senhance System technology would have an adverse effect on our business.
 
    25 

  

Further, our success will depend in part on the ability of us, the European Union and other third-party licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed intellectual property and, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights. We, the European Union or other third-party licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications which are licensed to us, may fail to maintain these patents, and may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than necessary to obtain an acceptable outcome from any such litigation. Without protection for the intellectual property we have licensed, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could materially adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and results of operations.
 
If we or our licensors are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on other proprietary rights, including protection of trade secrets, know-how and confidential and proprietary information. To maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we will seek to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual’s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. Our agreements with employees also generally provide and will generally provide that any inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property. However, we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances, and individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information, these agreements, even if obtained, may not provide meaningful protection, particularly for our trade secrets or other confidential information. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use technology or know-how owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise between us and those third parties as to the rights in related inventions. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
If we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products, our business could be materially harmed.
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop or license under the patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries, so that we can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information. However, we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents required for us to commercialize our proposed products. Because certain U.S. patent applications are confidential until patents issue, such as applications filed prior to November 29, 2000, or applications filed after such date which will not be filed in foreign countries, third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications, and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications. For this and other reasons, we or our third-party collaborators may be unable to secure desired patent rights, thereby losing desired exclusivity. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, we will not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities, unless we challenge the validity, enforceability or infringement of the third-party patent or otherwise circumvent the third-party patent.
 
Our strategy depends on our ability to promptly identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries. In addition, we may rely on third-party collaborators to file patent applications relating to proprietary technology that we develop jointly during certain collaborations. The process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming. If our present or future collaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, our business will be adversely affected. Despite our efforts and the efforts of our collaborators to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to develop and use information that we regard as proprietary.
 
The issuance of a patent provides a presumption, but does not guarantee that it is valid. Any patents we have obtained, or obtain in the future, may be challenged or potentially circumvented. Moreover, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or patent applications. Any such challenge to our patents or patent applications would be costly, would require significant time and attention of our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, future court decisions may introduce uncertainty in the enforceability or scope of any patent, including those owned by medical device companies.
 
Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. The patent position of medical device companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards that the USPTO and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in medical device patents. Accordingly, we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, the enforceability or scope of our owned or licensed patents in the United States or in foreign countries cannot be predicted with certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. We may not be able to obtain or maintain patent protection for our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties.
 
    26 

  

We cannot assure you that any patents that will issue, that may issue or that may be licensed to us will be enforceable or valid or will not expire prior to the commercialization of our products, thus allowing others to more effectively compete with us. Therefore, any patents that we own or license may not adequately protect our future products.
 
Risks Related to Regulation of our Business
 
Even if we obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products, the terms thereof and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products, which could materially impair our ability to generate anticipated revenues.
 Once regulatory clearance or approval has been granted, the cleared or approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review. Any cleared or approved product may be promoted only for its indicated uses. In addition, if the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities clear or approve any of our products, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and promotion for the product will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. We and any outsourced manufacturers of our products are also required to comply with the FDA’s QSR, or similar requirements of non-U.S. regulatory authorities which includes requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation as well as other quality system requirements and regulations from non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Further, regulatory agencies must approve our manufacturing facilities for Class III devices before they can be used to manufacture our products, and all manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspection. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA, either before or after clearance or approval, or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, or if previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:
 

• | restrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adverse inspectional observations (Form 483), warning letters, non-warning letters incorporating inspectional observations, or consent decrees;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | civil or criminal penalties or fines;
--+--------------------------------------


• | injunctions;
--+-------------


• | product seizures, detentions or import bans;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | suspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearances or approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | total or partial suspension of production;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to clear or approve pending applications or premarket notifications; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | import and export restrictions.
--+--------------------------------

 
Any of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.
 
In addition, the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may change their policies and additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory clearance or approval of our products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we would likely not be permitted to market our future products and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. 
 
    27 

  

Once our products are cleared or approved, modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances, de novo clearance, premarket approvals or new or amended CE Certificates of Conformity, and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances, approvals or the relevant CE Certificates of Conformity are obtained.
 Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a PMA or de novo clearance. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review such determinations. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations for any future changes, or prior changes to previously marketed products, as the case may be, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified products until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 
Furthermore, the FDA’s ongoing review of the 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our products, either by imposing more strict requirements on when a new 510(k) for a modification to a previously cleared product must be submitted, or applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. In October 2017, the FDA issued guidance documents addressing when to submit a new 510(k) due to modifications to 510(k) cleared products and the criteria for evaluating substantial equivalence. The interpretation of the guidance documents by the FDA staff could lead to instances where the FDA disagrees with the Company’s decision regarding a change, and could result in warning letters and other enforcement actions.
 
Our products are subject to international regulatory processes and approval or certification requirements. If we do not obtain and maintain the necessary international regulatory approvals or certifications, we will not be able to sell our products in other countries.
 To be able to sell our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals or certifications and comply with the regulations of those countries, which may differ substantially from those of the U.S. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or certifications and the time required for regulatory review, and vary from country to country. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or certifications is complex, and timing to obtain clearances or certifications in those countries varies; therefore, we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals or certifications in any other country in which we plan to market our products or obtain such approvals or certifications on a favorable schedule. The time required to obtain marketing authorization in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA authorization. If we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or certification in any other country in which we plan to market our products, our ability to generate revenue will be harmed. Regulatory authorization of a product in one country does not ensure regulatory authorization in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining marketing authorization in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
One of the most significant moving targets related to the regulatory landscape is in the EU; more specifically, the medical devices regulation has recently evolved. Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices became applicable in the European Union on May 26, 2021. The Medical Device Regulation (MDR) changes the European legal framework for medical devices and introduces new principal and supportive responsibilities for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and for national competent authorities in the assessment of certain categories of products. Our products in EU countries must now comply with extensive safety and quality regulations detailed in the MDR.
 
The MDR, which replaced the MDD in May 2021 after a four-year transition period, imposes significant additional premarket and post-market certification requirements on medical devices marketed in the EU. European Economic Area (EEA) Member State legislation may also restrict or impose limitations on our ability to advertise our products directly to the general public. In addition, voluntary EU and national codes of conduct provide guidelines on the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare providers harming our business, operating results and financial condition.  If we are unable to obtain timely, updated post-market certifications for our products under the MDR, or experience difficulty scheduling with a Notified Body, our business prospects in the EU could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
 
Even after clearance or approval for our products is obtained, we are subject to extensive post-market regulation by the FDA and other regulators. Our failure to meet strict regulatory requirements could require us to pay fines, incur other costs or even close our facilities.
 Even after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, the FDA has the power to require us to conduct post-market studies. These studies can be very expensive and time-consuming to conduct. Failure to complete such studies in a timely manner could result in the revocation of clearance or approval and the recall or withdrawal of the product, which could prevent us from generating sales from that product in the United States. The FDA has broad enforcement powers, and any regulatory enforcement actions or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some surgeons from using our products and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived safety and efficacy of our products.
 
    28 

  

We are also required to comply with the FDA’s QSR, which covers the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, shipping, installation and servicing of our marketed products. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. In addition, in the future, regulatory authorities and/or customers may require specific packaging of sterile products, which could increase our costs and the price of our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.
 
If one of our products, or a malfunction of one of our products, causes or contributes to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.
 Under the FDA’s MDR regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall, which could divert managerial and financial resources, impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner, and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. We are also required to follow detailed recordkeeping requirements for all firm-initiated medical device corrections and removals, and to report such corrective and removal actions to the FDA if they are carried out in response to a risk to health and have not otherwise been reported under the MDR regulations.
 
All manufacturers bringing medical devices to market in the EEA are legally bound to report any incident that led or might have led to the death or serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user or other person, and which the manufacturer’s device is suspected to be a contributory cause, to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. In such case, the manufacturer must file an initial report with the relevant competent authority, which would be followed by further evaluation or investigation of the incident and a final report indicating whether further action is required.  Any adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Adverse events involving our products have been reported to us in the past, and we cannot guarantee that they will not occur in the future. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.
 
A recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.
 The FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities such as the competent authorities of the EEA countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues.
 
Any future recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers’ demands. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.
 
U.S. legislative or FDA regulatory reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after approval is obtained.
 Legislative changes could significantly alter the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance could be revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that could significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions, or reinterpretations of existing regulations, may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 
Disruptions at the FDA and other government agencies or notified bodies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain, or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent products from being developed, cleared, certified, approved, or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect our business.
 The delivery of healthcare by hospitals, health systems, and physicians depends on a number of government agencies and services. Further prolonged government shutdowns or restrictions could impact inspections, regulatory review and certifications, grants, or approvals or could cause other situations that could impede their ability to effectively deliver healthcare, including attempts to reduce payments and other reimbursements to hospitals by federal healthcare programs. These situations could adversely affect our customers’ ability to perform procedures with our devices and/or their decisions to purchase additional products from us.
 
    29 

  

In addition, the review and clearance, approval, or certification of new products can be affected by a variety of factors globally, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to unpredictable and ever-changing political processes. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies or notified bodies for any of these or other reasons may cause significant regulatory delays and, therefore, delay our efforts to seek clearances, approvals, or certifications from the FDA, foreign authorities, and notified bodies and adversely affect business travel and import and export of products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.
 
Separately, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, in early 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities and products through April 2020 and temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. In mid-2020, the FDA resumed certain on-site inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a risk-based prioritization system. In 2021, the FDA resumed standard inspectional operations of domestic facilities and announced its intention to resume certain prioritized inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities, including surveillance and application-related inspections, starting in February 2022. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA, other regulatory authorities, or notified bodies from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact their ability to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
We may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician payment transparency laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.
 Our business activities are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician payment transparency laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 
We are subject to an evolving set of complex laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information collection matters.
 There are numerous state, federal, and foreign laws, regulations, decisions, and directives regarding privacy and the collection, storage, transmission, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of different types of personal data and personal information and other customer or other data, the scope of which is continually evolving and subject to differing interpretations. We also must comply with the policies, procedures and business requirements of our customers relating to data privacy and security, which can vary based upon the customer, the customer’s industry or location, and the product the customer selects, and which may be more restrictive than the privacy and security measures required by law or regulation. In particular, the European Union and many countries in Europe have stringent privacy laws and regulations, which may impact our ability to profitably operate in certain European countries or to offer products that meet the needs of customers subject to European Union privacy laws and regulations.
 
For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) in effect across the EEA, imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including imposing strict standards when obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, requiring detailed disclosures to individuals, providing individual data rights, imposing short time lines for data breach notifications, limiting retention periods and secondary use of information, imposing certain requirements pertaining to health data, as well as additional obligations when we contract third-party processors to process personal data. The GDPR provides that EEA Member States may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric, or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase and harm our business and financial condition. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EEA member states may result in fines of up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year and other administrative penalties. Compliance with the new data protection rules imposed by GDPR may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
Likewise, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, is a state law that gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information and how their personal information is used and imposes compliance obligations on many organizations doing business in California that collect information about California residents. The definition of personal information is very broad and may impact our ability to profitably operate across the United States given that our customers’ employees may be resident in California or to offer products that meet the needs of customers subject to California privacy laws and regulations. The CCPA also allows for significant fines by the state attorney general as well as a private right of action for individuals in connection with certain security breaches. The enactment of the CCPA is prompting a wave of similar legislative developments in other US states and creating the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. These developments are increasing our compliance burden and our risk, including risks of regulatory fines, litigation and associated reputational harm.
 
    30 

  

The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, our customers’ own requirements and the privacy and security laws and regulations that are applicable to our customers’ businesses may limit the use and adoption of our products and reduce overall demand. Non-compliance with our customers’ specific requirements may lead to termination of contracts with these customers or liabilities to the customers; non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations may lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities.
 Furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers’ workers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our products effectively. If a customer experiences a significant data security breach involving our products, our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect the personal information of their employees, customers and suppliers, which could cause our customers to discontinue use of our products. The loss of confidence from a significant data security breach involving our software products could hurt our reputation, cause sales and marketing challenges to existing and new customers, cause loss of market share or exacerbate competitive pressures, result in an increase in our development costs to address any potential vulnerabilities in our software products, and may result in reduced demand and revenue. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our products in certain industries.
 
Domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives and our customers’ privacy policies and practices may adversely affect our and our customers’ ability to process, handle, store, use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees, customers and suppliers, which could reduce demand for our products.
 
In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our software products. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require it to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Any failure, or perceived failure, on our part to comply with any regulatory requirements or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against it by governmental entities or others, subject it to significant penalties or fines and negative publicity and adversely affect us.
 
General Risk Factors
 
If we fail to attract and retain key management and professional personnel, we may be unable to successfully commercialize or develop our products.
 We will need to effectively manage our operational, sales and marketing, development and other resources in order to successfully pursue our commercialization and research and development efforts for our existing and future products. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel.  If we are not successful in retaining and recruiting highly qualified personnel, our business may be harmed as a result.
 
We may become subject to potential product liability claims, and we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage.
 Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the design, testing, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products and each of our product candidates that we are seeking to introduce to the market. Surgical medical devices involve significant risks of serious complications, including bleeding, nerve injury, paralysis, infection, and even death. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or in our inability to secure coverage in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, if our product liability insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damages award, we may have to pay the excess of this award out of our cash reserves, which could significantly harm our financial condition. If longer-term patient results and experience indicate that our products or any component of a product causes tissue damage, motor impairment or other adverse effects, we could be subject to significant liability. A product liability claim, even one without merit, could harm our reputation in the industry, lead to significant legal fees, and result in the diversion of management’s attention from managing our business.
 
If we experience an intrusion of or disruption to our information technology systems, we may be harmed. 
 We rely on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business. Our systems are subject to cyber-attacks, viruses, worms, malicious software programs, outages, equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, human error and other malicious intrusions, which may materially disrupt our business and compromise our data. We may not be able to anticipate and prevent such disruptions or intrusions, and we may not be able to mitigate them when and if they occur. Any failure, breach or unauthorized access to our or third-party systems could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in service or production or otherwise our ability to conduct business operations and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability. Furthermore, we may incur significant costs in responding to any such disruption or intrusion and remedying our systems. In such event we may also be subject to litigation and other potential liability, which could materially impact our business and financial condition. Moreover, a breach or disruption of our information technology systems could damage our reputation. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy and data security issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the protection of information become more complex, the potential risks and costs of compliance to the company’s business will intensify.
