ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Volt Information Sciences, Inc. (the “Company” or “Volt”) is a global provider of staffing services (traditional time and materials-based as well as project-based). Our staffing services consist of workforce solutions that include providing contingent workers, personnel recruitment services, and managed staffing services programs supporting primarily administrative and light industrial (“commercial”) as well as technical, information technology and engineering (“professional”) positions. Our managed service programs (“MSP”) involves managing the procurement and on-boarding of contingent workers from multiple providers. Our customer care solutions business specializes in serving as an extension of our customers' consumer relationships and processes including collaborating with customers, from help desk inquiries to advanced technical support. We also provided quality assurance services through the date of sale of this business in October 2017. In addition, through the date of the sale of Maintech in March 2017, we provided information technology infrastructure services. Our information technology infrastructure services provided server, storage, network and desktop IT hardware maintenance, data center and network monitoring and operations. 
 The Company was incorporated in New York in 1957. Unless the context otherwise requires, throughout this report, the words “Volt,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Volt Information Sciences, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Geographic Regions and Segments
Volt operates in approximately 85 locations, with approximately 88% of our revenues generated in the United States where we have employees in nearly all 50 states. Our principal non-U.S. markets include Europe, Canada and several Asia Pacific locations. Our global footprint enables us to deliver consistent quality to our large strategic customers that require an established international presence.
We report our segment information in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”). See Note 19, “Segment Disclosures” for further information. 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, in accordance with ASC 280, the Company determined that its North American Managed Service Program (“MSP”) business meets the criteria to be presented as a reportable segment. To provide period over period comparability, the Company has recast the prior period North American MSP segment data to conform to the current presentation. This change did not have any impact on the consolidated financial results for any period presented. 
Our current reportable segments are (i) North American Staffing, (ii) International Staffing and (iii) North American MSP. All other business activities that do not meet the criteria to be reportable segments are aggregated with corporate services in the Corporate and Other category. Our reportable segments have been determined in accordance with our internal management structure, which is based on operating activities. We evaluate business performance based upon several metrics, primarily using revenue growth and segment operating income as the relevant financial measures. We believe segment operating income provides management and investors a measure to analyze operating performance of each business segment against historical and competitors’ data, although historical results, including operating income, may not be indicative of future results as operating income is highly contingent on many factors including the state of the economy, competitive conditions and customer preferences. 
We allocate all support related costs to the operating segments except for costs not directly relating to our operating activities such as corporate-wide general and administrative costs. These costs are not allocated to individual operating segments because doing so would not enhance the understanding of segment operating performance and such costs are not used by management to measure segment performance.
Description of the Reportable Segments and Corporate and Other Category
North American and International Staffing Segments
Our two staffing services segments provide workforce management expertise through locations in North America, Europe and several Asia Pacific locations. We deliver a broad spectrum of contingent staffing, direct placement, staffing management, and other employment services. Our contingent workers are placed on assignment with our customers in a broad range of occupations including manufacturing, assembly, warehousing, industrial, information technology, engineering, pharmaceutical, administrative, call center, accounting and finance.

Our contingent staffing services are provided for varying periods of time to companies and other organizations (including government agencies) ranging from smaller retail accounts that may require ten or fewer contingent workers at a time to large strategic accounts that require as many as several thousand contingent workers at a time. Our large strategic accounts typically enter into longer term agreements with us resulting in lower direct margins compared to our retail accounts.
Within our staffing services segments, we refer to customers that require multi-location, coordinated account management and service delivery in multiple skill sets as strategic customers, while our retail customers are primarily in a single location with sales and delivery handled primarily from a geographically local team and with relatively few headcount on assignment in one or two skill sets. We provide traditional staffing services for which we are paid predominantly on a time and materials basis. The contingent staff that we provide often work under the supervision of our customers.
Volt’s contingent staffing services enable customers to easily scale their workforce to meet changing business conditions, complete a specific project, secure the services of a specialist on an as-needed basis, substitute for regular employees during vacation or other temporary absences, staff high turnover positions, or meet seasonal peaks in workforce needs. When requested, we also provide Volt personnel at the customer’s location to coordinate and manage contingent workers. Many customers rely on Volt’s staffing services as a strategic element of their overall workforce, allowing them to more efficiently meet their fluctuating staffing requirements.
Contingent workers are recruited through proprietary internet recruiting sites, independent web-based job search companies, and social networking talent communities through which we build and maintain proprietary databases of candidates from which we can fill current and future customer needs. The majority of contingent workers become Volt employees during the period of their assignment and we are responsible for the payment of wages, payroll taxes, workers’ compensation insurance, unemployment insurance and other benefits. Customers will sometimes hire Volt’s contingent workers as their own employees after a period of time, for which we usually receive a fee.
We also provide recruitment and direct placement services of specialists in the accounting, finance, administrative, call center, engineering, information technology, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, assembly and industrial support disciplines. These services are primarily provided on a contingency basis with fees earned only if our customers ultimately hire the candidates.
North American MSP Segment
Our North American MSP segment consists of managing the procurement and on-boarding of contingent workers and a broad range of specialized solutions that includes managing suppliers and providing sourcing and recruiting support, statement of work management, supplier performance measurement, optimization and analysis, benchmarking of spend demographics and market rate analysis, consolidated customer billing, and supplier payment management. The workforce placed on assignment through our MSPs is usually provided by third-party staffing providers (“associate vendors”) or through our own staffing services. In most cases, we are only required to pay associate vendors after we receive payment from our customer. Our staffing services businesses also act as a subcontractor or associate vendor to other national providers in their MSPs. Our MSPs are typically administered through the use of vendor management system software (“VMS”) licensed from various VMS providers.
In addition, our North American MSP segment provides payroll service solutions as well as recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) for our customers. With our payroll service solution (also known as referred services), the customer refers an individual to us, we employ the individual, and the individual works on an assignment for the customer at the customer’s worksite. We manage and administer the individual’s payroll, payroll taxes, workers’ compensation, and benefits. 
Corporate and Other Category
Our Corporate and Other category consists of our customer care solutions, corporate services, remote hire services business in India, as well as our quality assurance services and information technology infrastructure services business in prior years. We sold our information technology infrastructure business during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and the quality assurance business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
Our customer care solutions business specializes in serving as an extension of our customers' relationships and processes including collaborating with customers, from help desk inquiries to advanced technical support.
Our corporate services provide entity-wide general and administrative functions that support all of our segments.
Our remote hire services in India provide skilled resources, technical infrastructure, and management for various areas including software development, engineering, web design, technical support, call center operations, sales and marketing, customer service, research, and back-office accounting and administration.
Through the date of sale of Maintech in March 2017, our information technology infrastructure business provided IT hardware maintenance services on major brands of server, storage, network and desktop products to Fortune 1000 companies. Other

services provided include remote monitoring for corporate data centers and networks, and planning, migration and support services for clients seeking to migrate to a cloud environment. We delivered our services across the United States and in major business centers globally and sold these services directly to corporate customers and through value-added resellers, partners and other resellers. Our target markets included financial services, telecommunications and aerospace. 
Through the date of sale in October 2017, our quality assurance services assisted in ensuring our customers’ products perform as designed. These services extended to game, hardware, software, consumer product and mobile product and service offerings. We also provided business intelligence and analytics services by assisting our customers in making informed business decisions through implementing quality assurance methodologies, which when combined with visibility of our customers’ data allowed us to reduce inefficiencies and optimize our customers’ business.
Business Strategy 
Strengthen the Foundation
Fiscal 2017 and 2016 were years focused on strengthening our foundation by simplifying our corporate structure, streamlining operational focus, strengthening our balance sheet and improving financial flexibility. 
We successfully monetized non-strategic company-owned real estate in fiscal 2016 and we sold our quality assurance and our information technology infrastructure businesses in fiscal 2017. These divestitures enabled us to strengthen our liquidity position, simplify our corporate structure and streamline operational focus on opportunities within our core staffing services business.
In fiscal 2017, we deployed a new information technology system which encompasses our front and back-office financial suite that is critical to our success and offer more functionality at a lower cost to the Company. These upgrades will continue to improve our time to market and competitiveness in sales delivery, which will support and enhance our future growth.
In addition, during fiscal 2017, we significantly reduced our outstanding debt by $47.1 million, or 48%, as compared to debt outstanding at the end of fiscal 2016. On January 25, 2018, we entered into a two-year $115.0 million accounts receivable securitization program with DZ Bank AG Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschafsbank (“DZ Bank”) which improved our debt maturity profile, providing additional runway to execute our strategic plan.
Current Strategic Priorities
In fiscal 2018, we hired prominent staffing industry veterans to strengthen our sales leadership team with a focus on our new sales strategy to enhance financial performance and build a foundation for sustainable growth. This strategy includes the following priorities:

• | Organizational Design - To strengthen the focus on sales and delivery performance across a spectrum of service offerings for maximum competitive advantage, we formed the Specialty Solutions Group, Strategic Solutions Group and Global Solutions Group. This design will allow Volt to steer its “go-to-market” strategy and performance based on a specialized job segment view as well as transform its delivery models to achieve dedicated focus, enhanced agility for customers’ needs and low-cost delivery benefits.


• | Business Optimization - Drive further efficiencies, productivity and cost savings by optimizing technology to drive performance through increased integration of available digital tools, reporting and processes and migrating from manual, customized processes to automated, standard processes. We expect these enhancements to yield meaningful cost savings, a portion of which can then be re-invested into important recruiting and candidate acquisition resources.


• | Delivery Excellence - Improve talent acquisition and delivery with a more focused, customized, agile delivery approach by integrating recruiting tools to increase our speed to match candidates and to mobilize data analytics to drive strategy around job postings and return on investments. This initiative will continue to evolve based on the needs of our clients, and as we continue to improve in attracting candidates in the market.


• | Growth and Expansion - Achieve revenue and margin growth with new and existing client relationships, through realigned sales and delivery efforts. We are re-establishing our sales culture by realigning the sales teams based upon client buying patterns with an emphasis on building client relationships. To further incentivize growth within the sales teams, we overhauled our bonus plans to align with a ‘pay for performance’ structure and we have introduced a higher level of visibility and accountability into the sales culture.

Capital Allocation
We have prioritized our capital allocation strategy to strengthen our balance sheet and increase our competitiveness in the marketplace. The timing of these capital allocation priorities is highly dependent upon attaining the profitability objectives outlined in our plan. We also see this as an opportunity to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to Volt shareholders as we continue to execute on our plan and return to sustainable profitability. Our capital allocation strategy includes the following elements:

• | Maintaining appropriate levels of working capital. Our business requires a certain level of cash resources to efficiently execute operations. Consistent with similar companies in our industry and operational capabilities, we estimate this amount to be 1.5 to 2.0 times our weekly cash distributions on a global basis and must accommodate seasonality and cyclical trends;


• | Reinvesting in our business. We continue to execute on our company-wide initiative of disciplined reinvestment in our business including investing in an experienced industry leadership team and in our sales and recruiting process, which are critical to drive profitable growth. We also continue to invest in our information technology systems, which will support our front-end recruitment and placement capabilities as well as increase efficiencies in our back-office financial suite; and


• | Deleveraging our balance sheet. By lowering our debt level, we will strengthen our balance sheet, reduce interest costs and reduce risk going forward.

Customers
The Company serves multinational, national and local customers, providing staffing services (traditional time and materials-based as well as project-based), managed service programs and customer care solutions (as well as quality assurance services and information technology infrastructure services in fiscal 2017 and 2016). The Company had no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. Our top 10 customers represented approximately 36%, 30% and 27% of revenue in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The loss of one or more of these customers, unless the business is replaced, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.
In fiscal 2018, the International Staffing segment's revenue included three customers which accounted for approximately 13%, 12% and 11% of the total revenue of that segment. The North American MSP segment's revenue included one customer which accounted for approximately 12% of the total revenue of that segment.
In fiscal 2017, the North American MSP segment's revenue included one customer which accounted for approximately 34% of the total revenue of that segment.
In fiscal 2016, the International Staffing segment's revenue included one customer which accounted for approximately 11% of the total revenue of that segment.
In fiscal 2016, the North American MSP segment's revenue included two customers which accounted for approximately 31% and 15% of the total revenue of that segment.
For fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, 88%, 87% and 86% of our total revenue, respectively, was from customers in the United States. 
Competition
In most areas, no single company has a dominant share of the employment services market. The largest companies in the industry collectively represent less than half of all staffing services revenues, and there are many smaller companies competing in varying degrees at local levels or in particular market sectors. Dominant leaders in the industry include Allegis, Adecco, Manpower Group, Randstad and Kelly Services, Inc.
In addition, there are numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate. Companies in our industries primarily compete on price, service quality, new capabilities and technologies, marketing methods and speed of fulfilling assignments.
Intellectual Property
VOLT is the principal registered trademark for our brand in the United States. ARCTERN, PARTNER WITH US. COMPETE WITH ANYBODY, REMOTEHIRE and VOLTSOURCE are other registered trademarks in the United States. The Company also owns and uses common law trademarks and service marks.

We also own copyrights and license technology from many providers. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights in the United States and abroad to protect our brand and proprietary information.
Seasonality
Our staffing services revenue and operating income are typically lowest in our first fiscal quarter due to the holiday season and are affected by customer facility closures during the holidays (in some cases for up to two weeks), and closures caused by severe weather conditions. The demand for our staffing services typically increases during our third and fourth fiscal quarters when customers increase the use of our administrative and industrial labor during the summer vacation period. The first couple of months of the calendar year typically have the lowest margins as employer payroll tax contributions restart each year in January. Margins typically increase in subsequent fiscal quarters as annual payroll tax contribution maximums are met, particularly for higher salaried employees.
Employees
As of October 28, 2018, Volt employed approximately 20,100 people, including approximately 18,600 who were on contingent staffing assignments, the remainder are full-time employees. The workers on contingent staffing assignments are on our payroll for the length of their assignment.
We are focused on developing a team that has both strong and deep experience and the leadership skills that are required to support our growth. Our strategy is to be a leader in the markets we serve, which we will achieve by developing new workforce capabilities and a committed, diverse world-class management team.
We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. While claims and legal actions related to staffing matters arise on a routine basis, we believe they are inherent in maintaining a large contingent workforce.
Regulation
Some states in the United States and certain foreign countries license and regulate contingent staffing service firms and employment agencies. Compliance with applicable present federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations has not had, and we believe that compliance with those laws and regulations in the future will not have, a material effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
