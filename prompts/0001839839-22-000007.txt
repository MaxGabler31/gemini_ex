Item 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Janus International Group, Inc. (f/k/a Janus Parent, Inc.) (“we,” “us,” “Group,” “Janus” or the “Company”), headquartered in Temple, Georgia with eleven domestic and three international manufacturing facilities is a leading global manufacturer, supplier and provider of turn-key self-storage, commercial, and industrial building solutions. The Company provides facility and door automation and access control technologies, roll up and swing doors, hallway systems, and relocatable storage “MASS” (Moveable Additional Storage Structures) units (among other solutions). The Company is fundamental to its customer’s success throughout every phase of a project by providing solutions spanning from facility planning and design, construction, technology, and the restoration, rebuilding, and replacement (“R3”) of damaged or end-of-life products.
Company History
The Company was founded in 2002, originally to provide the best-in-industry door systems for the self-storage industry. Over the last 20 years, the Company has consistently expanded its product offerings to the self-storage industry while also diversifying its product and solution offerings into commercial industrial end markets. The Company started operations in Temple, Georgia providing value-added door systems to self-storage clients, and in 2003 expanded to Surprise, Arizona to better serve clients in the Western U.S. In 2004, we opened a facility in Houston, Texas to address demand in the Southwest and moved internationally in 2006 by establishing a joint venture in Peterlee, United Kingdom to provide solutions to the European market. Additionally, in 2009, we acquired Epic Doors, Inc. to strengthen the Company’s domestic presence in the sector and in 2011 acquired U.S. Door & Building Components, LLC to significantly increase our market share. In 2014, we opened a facility in Butler, Indiana to further penetrate the Midwestern and Canadian markets, and also acquired Steel Storage Europe to expand our offerings internationally. In 2017, the Company accelerated its plans in the commercial industrial door market through the acquisition of Asta Industries, Inc. (“ASTA”), and in 2018 we acquired Nokē, Inc. (“NOKE”) a Utah based software and technology company, which brought new access control products and solutions to our suite of product offerings to both the self-storage and commercial industrial markets through the development of the Nokē Smart Entry Platform. In December 2018, Janus completed the acquisition of Active Supply & Design (CDM) Ltd. (UK) (“AS&D”), a company based in the United Kingdom. AS&D is a self-storage design, construction and installation company whose operations were merged into Janus International Europe during 2021. In March 2019, we completed the acquisition of BETCO, Inc. (“BETCO”), a company based in North Carolina that is in the business of manufacturing and installing steel building structures for self-storage customers. In January 2020, Janus completed the acquisition of Steel Storage Australia and Asia (collectively, “Steel Storage”), a provider of self-storage design and construction services in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and surrounding regions. In March 2020, Janus completed the acquisition of PTI Australasia Pty Ltd, an Australian distributor of self-storage access control security and integrative technologies. In January 2021, the Company acquired G & M Stor-More Pty Ltd., which has over 23 years’ experience in self-storage building, design, construction and consultation. In August of 2021, Janus completed the acquisition of DBCI, LLC, (f/k/a Dingo Newco, LLC) (“DBCI”), an entity engaged in the business of manufacturing and installing door systems for the self-storage industry and the commercial industrial market. In September 2021, Janus completed the acquisition of Access Control Technologies, LLC, (“ACT”) a Company incorporated in North Carolina and certain assets and liabilities of Phoenix IronWorx, LLC (“Phoenix”). ACT is a low-voltage/security systems integrator that specializes in the self-storage and multi-family industries. With dedicated installation and service divisions, ACT has one of the largest addressable footprints in technology in the self-storage industry. Phoenix is a custom gate and fence fabricator primarily serving the self-storage industry. 
Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths have been instrumental in our growth and position the Company for continued success:
Strong Share in Growing, Well-Structured Markets. Management estimates the Company provides for approximately over 50% of the market for interior building solutions through both institutional REITs and non-institutional operators. REITs comprise approximately 30% of the overall self-storage market, and have grown significantly over the past decade and at a higher rate than the non-institutional market. Within the commercial industrial sector, we are a smaller participant within a larger addressable market, which provides the Company significant opportunity for market share growth within a sector that is well positioned for future growth driven by the rising growth of eCommerce. We have achieved this success within the self-storage and commercial industrial sectors by being a full solution provider to our customers, providing expertise, and a full suite of products to solve our customers’ problems.
Mission Critical Solutions for a Small Fraction of Facility Costs. Our self-storage products are typically the last items installed on site before an operator can generate income from its properties. This results in a high cost of failure for our suite of product solutions and a reliance by customers on our extensive domestic and international manufacturing and distribution networks. We focus on finding solutions to obstacles that arise long before a unit or facility is complete and customers place a premium on our efficiency, reliability, and ability to deliver. Our products also represent a small portion of the overall cost of a facility or an R3 retrofit. Our value-added services, such as site pre-work planning, site drawings, installation and general contracting, project management, and third-party security, as well as our ability to differentiate ourselves from the competition through on-time delivery, efficient installation, best-in-class service, and a reputation for high quality products, has allowed us to gain a significant competitive advantage.
Complete Offering of Products, Solutions, Services along with Maintenance, Fabrication and Installation . We provide a full suite of products, services and maintenance, fabrication and installation offerings that meet a wide-range of client demands including management of third-party installation, architect drawings, R3 solutions, self-storage doors, hallway systems, relocatable systems, electronic locks, commercial doors, self-storage maintenance and servicing and custom facility gate fabrication and installation all of which is realized through a large network of best-in-class, trusted third-party installers, as well as our eleven strategically placed manufacturing and service 
facilities in the United States. Our current manufacturing, service and distribution footprint enables us to serve customers globally, minimize lead times, and reduce freight expense. Our ability to provide a full suite of products, services, fabrication, installation and maintenance routines across a nationwide network enables us to compete for complex, marquee contract opportunities and deliver highly customized solutions at both the national and local level.
First Mover with Proprietary High ROI Technology Solutions. The Company and NOKE (which we acquired in 2018) have been working for several years to develop proprietary access control technologies, software, and solutions focused on the self-storage sector where limited technologies or products currently exist. We are actively selling security-as-a-service and have been able to disrupt the conventional security market by developing a platform with multiple attractive adjacencies including hardware (i.e. purpose-built locks), software (i.e. applications and a web portal) and back-end integration (i.e. APIs and a cloud platform) to support a compelling ROI opportunity for our client’s new facilities and R3 retrofits. Our proprietary hardware and smart locking systems have helped businesses effortlessly manage physical security and have laid the ground work for Janus to integrate an enhanced wireless network within a self-storage facility, thereby creating a segment of our business with limited competition and high barriers to entry.
Proven and Experienced Management Team. Our management team has deep industry expertise and a deep bench of supporting talent. Janus is led by its Chief Executive Officer, Ramey Jackson, who has been with the Company for over 19 years and has more than 20 years of experience in the industry. Mr. Jackson is supported by an executive leadership team that also has an average of over 20 years of experience. Our management team has a long track record of demonstrating an ability to produce robust and consistent organic and inorganic growth.
Our Acquisition Strategy. Our management team has a proven track record of identifying, executing, and integrating acquisitions to support our strategic growth initiatives. In order to achieve this growth, we utilize a disciplined, highly accretive acquisition strategy that prioritizes portfolio diversification into logical adjacencies, geographic expansion, and technological innovation. We continue to actively review a number of acquisition opportunities that fit this framework.
Acquisitions
ACT Acquisition
In August 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Janus International Group, LLC (“Janus Core”) acquired 100% of the equity of ACT. Through this acquisition, the Company also acquired all assets and certain liabilities of Phoenix, a company incorporated in North Carolina. ACT is a low-voltage/security systems integrator, who specializes in the self storage and multi-family industries. With dedicated installation and service divisions, ACT has one of the largest addressable footprints in technology in the self-storage industry and has specialized in protecting critical assets in the self-storage and industrial building industries for over 7 years. Phoenix specializes in the custom fabrication of gating and fencing solutions for the self-storage industry. The ACT team is comprised of security industry experts who continually train to be at the forefront of emerging industry trends, technological advancements, and new security vulnerabilities or hazards that threaten their clients. As a result of the acquisition, the Company will have an opportunity to expand its Nokē Smart Entry ground game and installation network.
DBCI Acquisition
In August 2021, the Company, through Janus Core, acquired 100% of the equity interests of DBCI, a company incorporated in Delaware. DBCI is a manufacturer of exterior building products in North America, with over 25 years’ servicing self-storage, commercial, residential, and repair markets. As a result of the acquisition, the Company will have an opportunity to increase its customer base of both the commercial and self-storage industries and expand its product offerings in the North American market.
G & M Stor-More Pty Ltd. Acquisition
In January 2021, the Company acquired the assets of G & M Stor-More Pty Ltd (“G&M”). G&M has over 23 years’ experience across the world in self-storage building, design, construction and consultation. As a result of the acquisition, Janus will have an opportunity to increase its customer base of the self-storage industry and expand our geographical reach in the Australian market.
PTI Australasia Pty Ltd. Acquisition
In March 2020, we completed the acquisition of PTI Australasia Pty Ltd, an Australian distributor of self-storage access control security and integrative technologies. We believe that the acquisition of PTI Australasia Pty Ltd adds to the breadth of its expertise in order to help accelerate the global adoption of the Nokē Smart Entry System.
Steel Storage Australia and Asia Acquisitions
In January 2020, we completed the acquisition of Steel Storage Australia and Asia, a provider of self-storage design and construction services in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and surrounding regions. The acquisition of Steel Storage expands our global automated product offerings and allows us to reach customers in a broader range of geographic locations.
BETCO Acquisition
In March 2019, we completed the acquisition of BETCO, a Delaware corporation in the business of manufacturing and installing steel building structures for self-storage customers. As a result of the acquisition, we have been able to grow our geographic presence and leverage our institutional customer relationships to expand our product offerings into a “one stop shopping” model that includes improved multi-story self-storage offerings.
AS&D Acquisition
In December 2018, we completed the acquisition of AS&D a company incorporated in England and Wales. AS&D is a self-storage design, construction and installation company. As a result of the AS&D acquisition, we increased our geographic presence and market share of the self-storage industry, specifically in the European market, and expanded its product offerings.
NOKE Acquisition
In December 2018, we completed the acquisition of NOKE, a Delaware corporation in the business of designing, manufacturing, supporting, and selling commercial security hardware and software solutions. As a result of the acquisition, we have effectively accelerated our smart entry solutions and product offerings, including our development of the Nokē Smart Entry System, a product which provides mobile access for tenants and remote monitoring and tracking for operators. This product has provided a substantial revenue opportunity for us through potential large-scale adoption among operators seeking to implement the Nokē Smart Entry System into their portfolio in order to remain competitive. The Nokē Smart Entry System also presents attractive recurring revenue opportunities that results from continued software support and maintenance.
ASTA Acquisition
In July 2017, we completed the acquisition of ASTA, a U.S. supplier of rolling-door products. This acquisition has allowed us to expand our product offerings in the commercial door segment of the self-storage market, which we have served since 2002 through our roll-up sheet doors for commercial application and pre-engineered buildings. ASTA, which offers more durable, heavy-duty rolling steel doors (18, 20, or 22 gauge) and provides additional commercial and heavy industrial solutions not offered by our roll-up sheet doors, has allowed us to increase our market-share in the commercial door market and reduce ASTA’s manufacturing costs through economies of scale.
Industry Overview
Self-Storage
Approximately 68% of our total sales are attributable to the self-storage market. The self-storage industry refers to properties that offer do-it-yourself, month-to-month storage space rental for personal or business use. Self-storage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their belongings, whether due to a life event or the need for extra storage.
According to management estimates there are approximately 55,000 self-storage facilities located in the United States. Self-storage facilities can be classified into two general categories: institutional and non-institutional. Institutionally owned facilities typically include multi-story, climate-controlled facilities located in prime locations owned and/or managed by a REIT or other returns-driven operator of scale. These institutional facilities are typically located in a top 50 U.S. MSA. Non-institutional facilities are comprised of single-story, non-climate-controlled facilities located outside of city centers owned and/or managed by smaller private operators that are mostly located outside of the top 50 U.S. MSAs.
The self-storage market is highly fragmented with REITs comprising approximately 30% of the overall self-storage market, having grown significantly over the past decade and at a higher rate than the non-institutional market. REITs often achieve growth via acquisition of existing self-storage facilities, which creates demand for remodeling solutions to conform branding to the acquirer’s colors, logos, and aesthetic.
The self-storage market benefits from unique and attractive demand and supply attributes. Growth in self-storage demand has been driven by favorable long-term macroeconomic trends, including rising storable consumption per capita, population growth, and rising home ownership rates. Available supply of self-storage is well below long-term levels, as exhibited by the key self-storage REITs operating at 96% occupancy rates based upon publicly available information as of third quarter 2021. In addition to ongoing tight supply conditions, management estimates that approximately 60% of existing self-storage facilities are over 20 years old, which creates the potential need for replacement and refurbishment of an aging installed base.
Given high existing occupancy rates and expected rising demand, investment in additional self-storage capacity may be required in the future. New self-storage capacity can be created in several ways, including greenfield construction, expansions of existing self-storage facilities, conversions of existing buildings into self-storage facilities (for example: mothballed Big Box retail locations), or via facility acquisitions and upgrades. Janus is the market leader in building solutions for the self-storage market, offering institutional and non-institutional operators the broadest product offering and unique end-to-end solutions.
Commercial Door
Approximately 32% of our total sales are attributable to the commercial industrial door market. Commercial doors are composed of either primarily metal, plastic, and wood and used in industrial facilities, office, retail, & lodging establishments, institutional buildings, and other non-residential infrastructure.
We compete within the metal commercial doors sub-sector with a focus on commercial roll-up sheet doors and rolling steel doors. Roll-up sheet doors are constructed of lighter gauge steel, are less durable, and less expensive than rolling steel doors. These doors are used in pre-engineered buildings and for applications where insulation is less important. Rolling steel doors are constructed of heavier gauge steel, are more durable, are more expensive than roll-up sheet and sectional doors, and are primarily used in facilities such as warehouses, particularly in heavy industrial applications (carrying with them the ability to better trap hot/cool air inside the facility).
The metal commercial door market has experienced strong growth driven by: (1) an increase in construction spending, (2) aging infrastructure, and (3) efforts to improve security, appearance, and the energy efficiency of buildings.
Within the commercial industrial sector, we are a smaller participant within a larger addressable market, which provides the Company with significant opportunity for market share growth within a sector that is well positioned for future growth driven by the rising growth of eCommerce.
Raw Materials
The principal raw material used by the Company is steel (steel coil). The Company purchases raw materials from a variety of commercial sources on a fixed and variable basis. The Company’s practice is to seek cost savings and enhanced quality by purchasing from a limited number of suppliers.
The steel industry is highly cyclical and prices for the Company’s raw materials are influenced by numerous factors beyond the Company’s control. The steel market continues to be dynamic, with a degree of uncertainty about future pricing trends. Given current conditions and the relative uncertainty surrounding the ongoing and still developing COVID-19 pandemic, the Company currently expects that a reasonable degree of uncertainty regarding steel prices will continue. Numerous factors may cause steel prices to increase in the future. In addition to increases in steel prices, steel mills may add surcharges for zinc, energy, and freight in response to increases in their costs. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Depending on relative demand in the raw materials market, the Company may purchase and carry more steel or other raw materials in inventory to meet projected sales demand, as required. 
Patent and Intellectual Property Rights
Generally, the Company, through Janus Core and its subsidiaries, seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business. Certain intellectual property, where appropriate, is protected by contracts, licenses, confidentiality or other agreements. From time to time, the Company takes action to protect its businesses by asserting its intellectual property rights against third-party infringers.
The Company maintains various trademarks that are registered or otherwise legally protected in the U.S. and many non-U.S. countries where products and services of the Company are sold. As part of the Company’s Nokē Smart Entry platform, the Company provides a limited right for its customers to publicly display certain trademarks of the Company in connection with the customer’s use and adoption of the Nokē Smart Entry solution. 
The Company has U.S. and foreign patents, the majority of which cover products that the Company currently manufactures and markets. These patents, and applications for new patents, cover various design aspects of the Company’s products, as well as processes used in their manufacture. The Company continues to develop new potentially patentable products, product enhancements, and product designs.
While the Company believes its intellectual property portfolio is important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitutes a valuable asset, no single patent, trademark, license or other intellectual property, or group of such intellectual property, is critical to the success of the business or any segment. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”
Seasonality
Generally, Janus’s sales tend to be the slowest in January due to more unfavorable weather conditions, customer business cycles and the timing of renovation and new construction project launches.
Regulation
Laws, ordinances, or regulations affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and taxation requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of self-storage sites or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our cash flows from operating activities.
Insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, as well as subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto.
Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws, we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated hazardous materials at one or more of our properties. For additional information on environmental matters and regulation, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Extensive environmental regulation to which we are subject creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.”
Human Capital
Workforce Demographics
As of January 1, 2022, we had 1,577 full-time and part-time employees worldwide (excluding 440 contract workers). Approximately 67% of our workforce is composed of hourly production associates, and the remaining population is composed of associates in a professional role. Our current worldwide workforce is made up of approximately 91% domestic employees and approximately 9% international employees.
We recognize that our employees are our greatest asset. As a result, the Company endeavors to create an environment that keeps our employees safe, treats them with dignity and respect and fosters a culture of performance recognition. The Company does this through the programs summarized below, the objectives and related risks of each are overseen by our Board of Directors or one of its committees.
Employee Health and Safety 
Safety is a core value at Janus and is a critical element to our continued growth strategy. We foster a culture that is committed to making safety a personal mission for every employee. Our overall goal is to eliminate workplace injuries. We also promote and foster an environment of empowerment and sharing throughout the company at all levels and at all locations. We engage our employees on safety with a focus on risk identification and elimination through various leading indicators. We track Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) recordable injuries and lost time rates by location monthly. We establish safety targets annually, which are tracked and reported to leadership monthly and reviewed with our Board of Directors.
The Company has an Environmental, Health & Safety committee comprised of representatives from across the Company’s businesses that share best practices and is responsible for driving our environmental, health and safety strategy. This helps drive our best-in-class programs designed to reinforce positive behaviors, empower our employees to actively take part in maintaining a safe work environment, to heighten awareness and mitigate risk on critical safety components. Within each of our manufacturing and distribution facilities, we have site-specific safety and environmental goals designed to reduce risk.
Total Rewards
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards program for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs not only include base wages and performance-based incentives, but also health, welfare, and retirement benefits.
We offer competitive health and wellness benefits to eligible employees and periodically conduct analyses of plan utilization to further tailor our employee benefits to meet their ongoing needs. In response to COVID-19, we continue to follow guidelines from governmental and local health authorities across our facilities and have implemented preventative measures that include working remotely, providing personal protective equipment, limiting group meetings, enhancing cleaning and sanitizing procedures, and social distancing. 
Talent Development and Succession
We aim to inspire and equip our employees to be successful in their current role within the organization and help them develop the skills to build on opportunities for future career growth. We understand our most critical roles that serve as points of leverage to deliver value and place our best people in those roles while attracting new talent and capabilities in support of continuous improvement in all we do. The Company uses performance management programs to support a high-performance culture, strengthen our employee engagement and help retain our top talent. 
Succession planning for critical roles is an important part of our development program across the Company. 
The Company is committed to developing our current talent and has made a significant investment in assessing our talent against the jobs both in the near term and in the future state. We are committed to ensuring our leaders are prepared for greater levels of responsibility and can successfully transition into new roles.
