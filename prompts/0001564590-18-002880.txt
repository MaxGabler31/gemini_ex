GENERAL
 We are a global nutrition company founded in 1980, with a purpose to make the world healthier and happier by developing and selling nutrition solutions for consumers looking to achieve results in the areas of weight management and general wellness, or to enhance their sports and fitness performance. As of December 31, 2017, we sold our products in 94 countries. We believe enhanced consumer awareness and demand for our products due to trends such as the global obesity epidemic, increasing healthcare costs, and aging populations, coupled with the effectiveness of personalized selling through a direct sales channel have been the primary reasons for our success throughout our 38-year operating history.
 We believe that direct selling is ideally suited to marketing our nutrition products because sales of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports & fitness, and outer nutrition products are strengthened by the personal contact, support, coaching, education, and the understanding community of like-minded people that our entrepreneurial Members offer.
 PRODUCT OVERVIEW
 For 38 years, our science-based products have helped Members and their customers from around the world lose weight, maintain their weight, improve their health and experience life-changing results. As of December 31, 2017, for the product categories weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports & fitness, and outer nutrition, we marketed and sold approximately 120 products encompassing over 4,700 SKUs globally. Our products are often sold as part of a program, and therefore our portfolio is comprised of a series of related products designed to simplify weight management and nutrition for our Members and their customers. We categorize our products into five groups: weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports & fitness, outer nutrition, and literature, promotional and other. For 2017, 2016, and 2015, our Formula 1 Healthy Meal, our best-selling product line, approximated 30% of our net sales.
 The following table summarizes our products by product category.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT & INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 We are committed to providing the highest-quality, science-based products to help our consumers achieve what we refer to as a “healthy, active lifestyle” in the areas of weight management; targeted nutrition (including everyday wellness and healthy aging); energy, sports & fitness; and outer nutrition. We rely on the scientific contributions from members of our Nutrition Advisory Board, along with our in-house scientific team, to continually upgrade or introduce new products as new scientific studies become available and accepted by regulatory authorities around the world. We also utilize the expertise of several international universities and key ingredient suppliers to review, evaluate and formulate new product ideas. Once a particular market opportunity has been identified, our scientists along with our operations, marketing and sales teams work closely with Member leadership to successfully introduce the product. We aim to have at least one major product launch each year in our key regions around the world, usually timed around our major regional Member education and training events. These launches generally target specific product categories and markets we deem strategic to grow our business.
 Marketing foods on the basis of sound science means using ingredients that have been well studied and discussed in background scientific literature. Use of these ingredients for their well-established purposes is by definition not novel, and for that reason, most food uses of these ingredients are not subject to patent protection. Notwithstanding the absence of patent protection, we do own proprietary formulations for substantially all of our weight management products and dietary and nutritional supplements. We take care in protecting the intellectual property rights of our proprietary formulas by restricting access to our formulas within the Company to those persons or departments that require access to them to perform their functions, and by requiring our finished goods-suppliers and consultants to execute supply and non-disclosure agreements that contractually protect our intellectual property rights. Disclosure of these formulas, in redacted form, is also necessary to obtain sanitary registrations in many countries. We also make efforts to protect some unique formulations under patent law. We strive to protect all new product developments as the confidential trade secrets of the Company and its inventor employees.
 We use the umbrella trademarks Herbalife® and the Tri-Leaf design worldwide, and protect several other trademarks and trade names related to our products and operations, such as Niteworks® and Liftoff®. Our trademark registrations are issued through the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and comparable agencies in the foreign countries. As of December 31, 2017, we had over 1,900 trademark registrations worldwide. We consider our trademarks and trade names to be an important factor in our business.
 GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE
 As of December 31, 2017, we conducted business in 94 countries throughout the world. The top ten countries worldwide represented approximately 71.8%, 72.9%, and 74.3% of our net sales in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. In the countries where we conduct business, we typically maintain a physical presence and provide sales, marketing, call center, logistics and distribution services. Globally our products can be accessed at over 1,600 locations. We distribute our products through our distribution and sales centers and certain retail partners.
 Our operating segments are based on geographical operations in six regions: North America, Mexico, South & Central America, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), Asia Pacific and China. The following table shows net sales by geographic region.

MANUFACTURING, WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION
 Our objective is to provide the highest quality products to our Members and their customers. We seek to accomplish this goal through execution of our “seed to feed” strategy that includes significant investments in quality assurance, scientific personnel, product testing, and increasing the amount of self-manufacturing of our top products. Our seed to feed strategy is rooted in using quality ingredients from traceable sources coupled with the vertical manufacturing of our most popular products. For our botanical products, our seed to feed strategy also includes self-manufacturing some of our teas and herbal ingredients. Our procurement activities for many botanicals now stretch back to the farms and include the complete self-processing of teas and botanicals into finished raw materials.
 The foundation for high quality products is the quality of the ingredients. Ingredients are sourced from companies that are large and reputable suppliers in their respective field. For example, soy, our number one ingredient, is sourced from DuPont and ADM. Our vitamins, minerals and other key ingredients come from companies such as DSM (formerly Roche Vitamins) and BASF. Other key suppliers include Tate & Lyle, Kyowa Hakko, and Naturex. In addition to our own modern quality processes, sourcing from these suppliers also provides integrity to our ingredients by utilizing similar quality processes, equipment, expertise and traceability provided by these leading ingredients companies.
 The next key component of our seed to feed strategy involves the high quality manufacturing of these ingredients into finished products, including vertical manufacturing. In addition to self-manufacturing, we purchase products from third-party manufacturers which account for a significant amount of our product purchases. During 2017, we purchased approximately 24% of our products from our top three third-party manufacturers. We work closely with our third-party manufacturers to ensure high quality products are produced and tested through a vigorous quality control process. Our current strategy is to continue expanding our self-manufacturing. We accelerated this initiative with the 2009 acquisition of Micelle Labs in Lake Forest, California and the renovation of the facility into a high-output, high-quality powder and liquid manufacturer. We call this facility the Herbalife Innovation and Manufacturing Facility (or “HIM”) Lake Forest. To further strengthen our seed to feed philosophy, we opened an herbal powder and extraction facility in June 2012 located in Changsha, China. The Changsha facility provides high quality tea and herbal raw materials to both our HIM plants as well as our contract manufacturers around the world. Also, we began production in May 2014 at the HIM Winston-Salem facility, which is our largest manufacturing facility at 800,000 square feet. This facility produces powders, liquids and teas and also has significant expansion opportunities. We have taken similar steps to support our China market, with our HIM Suzhou facility which began operation in 1999. In 2016 we completed renovations and equipment installations, and began operations in our HIM Nanjing, China facility. This has more than doubled our available finished product manufacturing capacity for the China market, and includes significant space for future expansion. Together, these facilities produce approximately 60% to 65% of our inner nutrition products sold worldwide. In our U.S. Company-owned facilities, which produce for the U.S. and most of our international markets, we operate and test to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA’s strict acidified food and dietary supplement current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), even though many of the products being manufactured are classified as food products that are generally subject to less stringent manufacturing standards. For those products not manufactured at HIM facilities, we combine four elements to ensure quality products: the same selectivity and assurance in ingredients as noted above; use of reputable, cGMP-compliant, quality-minded manufacturing partners; a significant supplier qualification and annual audit program; and significant product quality testing.
 In addition to ensuring high quality ingredients and building the quality into our finished products, we test our incoming raw materials for compliance to potency, identity and adherence to strict specifications. We also analyze our finished products for label claim and microbiological purity thereby verifying product safety and shelf life. For our self-manufactured products, we do substantially all of our testing in-house at our modern quality control laboratories in the U.S. and China. We have major quality control labs in Southern California, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Suzhou, China and our Worldwide Quality Center of Excellence in Changsha, China which tests products made at non-HIM facilities, even though they are already tested at audited contract manufacturer labs or third party labs. All HIM quality control labs contain modern analytical equipment and are backed by the expertise in testing and methods development of our scientists. We employ over 500 professionals performing science or technical related functions, which includes product development, quality control, and scientific and regulatory affairs around the world.

The final part of our seed to feed strategy is delivering the high-quality product to our Members and their customers. As the shift in consumption patterns continues to reflect an increasing daily consumption focus, our strategy is to provide more product access points closer to our Members and their customers. We operate distribution points ranging from “hub” distribution centers, or DCs, in Los Angeles, Memphis, and Venray, Netherlands, to mid-size distribution centers in major countries, to small pickup locations spread throughout the world. In addition to these Company-run distribution points, we partner with retail locations to provide Member pickup points in areas which are not well serviced from Company-run distribution points. In aggregate, our Company-run distribution points and partner retail locations represent over 1,600 locations around the world. As many of our products can be temperature sensitive, we monitor our DCs for temperature and humidity and occasionally will use shipping tags which monitor these parameters on certain shipments and provide information to help make adjustments to shipping mode or packaging components to ensure the quality of the product being delivered to an Herbalife Distribution Center.
 COMPETITION
 The categories of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports & fitness, and outer nutrition products are very competitive in many channels, including those of direct selling, the internet, specialty retailers, and the discounted channels of food, drugs and mass merchandise. We have differentiated ourselves from our peer group through our Members’ focus on the consultative sales process through product education and the frequent contact and support that many Members have with their customers through a community-based approach including Nutrition Clubs, Weight Loss Challenges, Wellness Evaluations and Fit Camps. From a competitive stand point, there are many providers in the multi-billion industry of weight management products, including quick-service restaurants and specialty retailers, but we believe that none have effectively combined nutrient dense products along with the personal coaching, community and education as well as product access, provided by our Members through their daily consumption business methods such as Nutrition Clubs, Weight Loss Challenges or Fit Camps.
 We are subject to competition for the recruitment of Members from other network marketing organizations, including those that market weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports & fitness, and outer nutrition products, and other types of products which are sold through direct selling, along with other entrepreneurial opportunities, including those organizations in which former employees or Members of the Company are involved. Our ability to remain competitive depends on having relevant products that meet consumer needs, a rewarding compensation plan, enhanced education and tools, innovation in our products and services, and a financially viable company.
 OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
 As a global nutrition company, we believe that the one-on-one personalized service inherent in the direct selling channel is the most effective way to sell nutrition products given the need for consumer education about good nutrition and a supportive approach to help consumers seeking to improve their eating habits. We believe that the direct-selling channel is ideally suited to marketing our products because sales of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports & fitness, and outer nutrition products are strengthened by ongoing personal contact, coaching, behavior motivation, and education between Members and their customers. This frequent, personal contact can enhance consumers’ nutritional and health education as well as motivate healthy behavioral changes in consumers to begin and maintain an active lifestyle through wellness and weight management programs. In addition, our Members consume our products themselves, and therefore can provide first-hand testimonials of the effectiveness of our products to their customers. This personal product experience of our Members has served as a powerful sales tool for over 38 years.
 Our business model enables us to grow our business with moderate investment in our infrastructure and fixed costs. We incur no direct incremental cost to add a new Member in our existing markets, and our Member compensation varies directly with product sales. In addition, our Members bear the majority of our consumer marketing expenses, and our sales leaders sponsor and coordinate a large share of Member recruiting, meeting and training initiatives. Furthermore, we can readily increase production and distribution of our products as a result of having our own manufacturing facilities and numerous third party manufacturing relationships, as well as our global footprint of in-house and third party distribution centers.
 Our objective is sustainable growth in the sales of our products to our Members and their customers by increasing the retailing productivity, retention and recruitment of our Member base through the following competitive strengths.
 Member Base
 Our Members are generally those who are eligible to purchase products directly from us.
 8


People become Herbalife Members for a number of reasons. Many first start out as consumers of our products who want to lose weight or improve their nutrition, and are customers of Members. Some later join Herbalife and become Members, which make them eligible to purchase products directly from us, simply to receive a discounted retail price on products they and their families can consume and enjoy.
 Some Members join Herbalife to earn part-time or full-time income and are drawn to the entrepreneurial opportunity to earn compensation based on their own skills and hard work. In addition to discounted prices, these Members can earn profit from several sources. First, Members may earn profits by purchasing our products at wholesale prices, discounted depending on the Member’s level within our Marketing Plan, and reselling those products at prices they establish for themselves. Second, Members who sponsor other Members and establish, maintain, coach and train their own sales organizations may earn commissions based upon their organization’s sales levels. Members may sponsor other Members in an attempt to build a sales organization, whether or not they have attained any particular level in our Marketing Plan.
 Members can achieve the sales leader level based on their purchasing and reselling activity and their organization’s sales production. Sales leaders who have sponsored other Members are also responsible for the development, retention and improved productivity of their sales organizations. However, there are also many Members, which include distributors, who have not sponsored another Member. These “single level” Members are generally considered discount buyers or small retailers. A number of these single-level Members have also attained the sales leader level.
 As of December 31, 2017, prior to our February re-qualification process, approximately 625,000 of our Members have attained the level of “sales leader”, of which approximately 536,000 have attained the level of “supervisor” and above in the 93 countries where we use our worldwide Marketing Plan and 89,000 sales officers and independent service providers operating under our China Marketing Plan. Collectively, we refer to this group as “sales leaders.” See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operating Results, for a further description of our Sales Leaders and retention rates.
 In China, while direct selling is permitted, multi-level marketing is not. As a result, our business model in China differs from that used in other countries. In China, where permitted by law, we sell our products through our Members who are independent contractors. However, Members in China are categorized differently than those in other countries. Chinese citizens who apply and become Members are referred to as “Sales Representatives.” Sales Representatives receive scaled rebates based on the volume of products they purchase. Sales Representatives who reach certain volume thresholds and meet certain performance criteria are eligible to apply to provide marketing, sales and support services. Once their application is accepted, they are referred to as “Service Providers.” Service Providers are independent business entities that are eligible to receive compensation from Herbalife for the marketing, sales and support services they provide so long as they satisfy certain conditions, including procuring the requisite business licenses and having a physical business location. Sales Representatives who are in the process of applying to become Service Providers hold the title of “Sales Officers.”
 Geographic Diversification
 We have expanded our network marketing organization into 94 countries as of December 31, 2017. While sales within our local markets may fluctuate due to economic, market and regulatory conditions, competitive pressures, political and social instability or for Company-specific reasons, we believe that our geographic diversity mitigates our exposure to any one particular market.
 Our Science and our Products
 We are committed to providing our Members with high-quality, science-based products to help them increase consumption and retail our products. We believe this can be best accomplished in part by introducing new products and by upgrading, reformulating and repackaging existing product lines. Our internal team of scientists and product developers collaborate with both our Nutrition Advisory Board and key ingredient suppliers to formulate, review and evaluate new product ideas. Once a particular market opportunity has been identified, our scientists along with our operations, marketing and sales teams work closely with our Member leadership to successfully introduce the product into the marketplace.
 We believe our focus on nutrition and botanical science and our efforts at combining our internal efforts with the scientific expertise of outside resources that include our ingredient suppliers, major universities, as well as our Nutrition Advisory Board have resulted in product differentiation that has given our Members and consumers increased confidence in our products. We continue to globalize our R&D efforts to better reflect the international nature of the Company by operating R&D centers in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Shanghai, China and Bangalore, India in addition to our main R&D center in Torrance, California.

We continue to increase our investments in the areas of science and other technical functions including: research and development associated with creating new product formulations, clinical studies of existing products or products in development, technical operations to improve current product formulations, quality assurance and quality control to establish the appropriate quality systems, controls and standards as well as rigorous ingredient and product testing to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, as well as in the areas of regulatory and scientific affairs. Globally, we spent approximately $74 million in 2017 on these activities, excluding any royalty fees associated with our products, which included approximately $3.0 million of research and development spending as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
 In 2010, we launched the Herbalife Nutrition Institute. The Institute is an informational resource dedicated to promoting excellence in the field of nutrition. The Institute’s website is our primary communication vehicle, and an educational resource for the general public, government agencies, the scientific community, and our Members, about good nutrition and basic health. Its mission is to encourage and support research and education on the relationship between good health, balanced nutrition and a healthy active lifestyle. In addition to providing research and education on the website and through sponsored conferences and symposia, the Institute has associations with major nutrition science organizations.
 Our Nutrition Advisory Board and Dieticians Advisory Board are comprised of leading experts around the world in the fields of nutrition and health who educate our Members on the principles of nutrition, physical activity, diet, and healthy lifestyle.
 Members of our Nutrition Advisory Board, Dieticians Advisory Board, and the editorial board of the Herbalife Nutrition Institute are affiliated with Herbalife as individuals and not as representatives of their respective universities or organizations.
 OUR STRATEGIES
 We work closely with our entrepreneurial Members to improve the sustainability of their businesses and reach consumers in over 90 countries to help make the world healthier and happier. These relationships are key to our continued success as they allow us direct access to the voice of consumers. Our Members eagerly identify and test new marketing efforts and programs developed by other Members and disseminate successful techniques to their sales organizations.
 As an example of the effectiveness of managing our Member relationship, around 2004, Members in Mexico developed marketing techniques that improved the productivity and efficiency of our Members as well as the affordability of our weight loss products through the creation of businesses that became known as “Nutrition Clubs”. Rather than buying several retail products, these businesses allow consumers to purchase and consume our products each day (a Member marketing technique we refer to as “daily consumption”), while continuing to benefit from the support and interaction with a Member as well as socializing with other customers in a designated location. Other programs to drive daily consumption, whether for weight management or for improved physical fitness, include Member conducted weight loss contests, or Weight Loss Challenges, and Member led fitness programs, or Fit Camps and Member led Wellness Evaluations. We refer to successful Member marketing techniques that we disseminate throughout our Member network, such as Nutrition Clubs, Weight Loss Challenges and Fit Camps as Distributor Methods of Operations, or DMOs.
 Our strategies to grow our business center on our positive and productive relationships with our Members and their relationships with consumers. These strategies include:
 Deliver Scientifically Validated Effective Products to Support a Healthy Active Lifestyle
 Our product strategy is focused on providing high-quality, science-based products that can support a healthy active lifestyle for Members and their customers in the areas of weight management; targeted nutrition (including everyday wellness and healthy aging); energy, sports & fitness; and outer nutrition. We rely on the scientific contributions from members of our Nutrition Advisory Board, along with our in-house scientific team, to continually upgrade or introduce new products as new scientific studies become available and accepted by regulatory authorities around the world. Additionally, to support our daily consumption initiatives, our product strategy includes projects such as seasonal flavors of our meal replacement shake, new flavors of top selling products and various package sizes and products that can be consumed hot, such as our savory shakes and soups. We have a keen focus on product innovation as we aim to have at least one major product launch in each region each year, timed around our major regional Member education and training events. These launches generally target specific product categories and markets we deem strategic to our business.

Improve the Sustainability of Members’ Businesses
 We believe our Members are the most important difference in how we go to market with our nutrition products, because of the one-on-one direct contact they have with their customers, along with the education, training and community support services that we believe help improve the nutrition habits of consumers. Combined with our efforts to improve the effectiveness of our Members’ marketing strategies is our strategy to improve the sustainability of our Members’ businesses in part through the evolution of our Marketing Plan.
 We believe a gradual qualification approach is generally important to the success and retention of new sales leaders and benefits the business in the long term as it allows new Members to obtain product and customer experience as well as additional training and education on Herbalife products, daily consumption based DMOs, and the business opportunity prior to becoming a sales leader. In general, to become a sales leader, or qualify for a higher level, Members must achieve specified Volume Point thresholds of product sales or earn certain amounts of royalty overrides during specified time periods and generally must re-qualify once each year.
 As a leading direct seller, we also endeavor to foster our Members to fairly and honestly market both our products and the business opportunity as part of being an Herbalife Member.
 Improve Members’ Skills through Training
 We believe that personal and professional development are key to our Members’ success and therefore we and our sales leaders have meetings and events to support this important objective. We and our Member leadership conduct training sessions on local, regional and global levels attended by thousands of Members to provide updates on product education, sales and marketing training, and instruction on available tools. These events are opportunities to showcase and disseminate our Members’ evolving best marketing practices from around the world such as Nutrition Clubs, Weight Loss Challenges, Fit Camps and other business methods, and to introduce new or upgraded products. A variety of training and development tools are also available through online and mobile platforms.
Increase Brand Awareness
 To increase our brand awareness, we and our Members have entered into numerous marketing alliances around the world. Herbalife sponsorships of and partnerships with featured athletes, teams and events promote brand awareness, the use of Herbalife products, and “Better Living Through Nutrition.” We continue to build brand awareness and work towards becoming the most trusted brand in nutrition. We also work to leverage the power of our Member base as a marketing and brand-building tool. We maintain a brand style guide and brand asset library so that our Members have access to the Herbalife brand logo and marketing materials for use in their marketing efforts.
Improve Product Access
 As adoption of daily consumption methods continue to expand, we have identified a number of methods and approaches that better support Members by providing access points closer to where they do business and by improving product delivery efficiency through our distribution channels. Specific methods vary by markets, considering local Member needs as well as infrastructure and available resources. We continue to expand the number of Sales Centers, smaller pick up locations (including third party collection points), brand experience centers and automated sales centers. This expansion is based on the needs of our Members and the growth of the business primarily from deeper penetration into existing markets. For example, we now have distribution agreements with multiple retailers. We believe that by leveraging the retailer’s distribution system we are providing our Members with easier product access. We will continue to evaluate the need to increase the number of product access points. Many Members today focus on the use of technology to support their businesses. With the increased activity towards our online and mobile tools, we have enhanced our product access and distribution network to support higher volumes of online or mobile orders which result in Members and their customers selecting home or business delivery options. We continue to see online or mobile ordering activity increase in many established markets.
Leverage Our Infrastructure
 We continue to invest in our manufacturing and operational infrastructure to accelerate new products to market and accommodate planned business growth. Additionally, we leverage our technology infrastructure in order to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, emerging data security risks, and changing user patterns and preferences.
 11


We leverage an Oracle business suite platform, which was upgraded in 2017, to support our business operations, improve productivity and support our strategic initiatives. In addition, we also employ information technology systems to support Members and their increasing demand to be more connected to Herbalife, their business and their consumers. These systems include our Internet-based marketing and Member services platform with tools such as BizWorks, MyHerbalife, GoHerbalife, iChange, and Herbalife Mobile. Additionally, we support a growing suite of point of sales tools to assist our Members with the ordering, tracking and their customer relationship management. We also invest in business intelligence tools to enable better analysis of our business and to identify opportunities for growth. We will continue to build on these platforms so that we can take advantage of the rapid development of technology around the globe to support a more robust Member and customer experience.
 OUR NETWORK MARKETING PROGRAM
 General
 Our products are sold or distributed through a global direct selling business model. Many individuals become part of our direct selling network simply to buy products at a discount directly from us for their own consumption. Others choose to also retail and distribute products that they purchase from us. Finally, some individuals choose to also build a direct sales force and earn compensation (which could include commissions, royalty overrides and production bonuses) based on the activity of their sales organizations, as well as an annual bonus that is based on several additional factors. In China, due to local regulations, we sell our products to and through independent service providers, sales representatives, and sales officers to customers and preferred customers, as well as through Company-operated retail stores when necessary.
 On July 18, 2002, we entered into an agreement with our Members that provides that we will continue to distribute Herbalife products exclusively to and through our Members and that, other than changes required by applicable law or necessary in our reasonable business judgment to account for specific local market or currency conditions to achieve a reasonable profit on operations, we will not make any material changes to certain aspects of our Marketing Plan that are adverse to our Members without the support of our Member leadership. Specifically, any such changes would require the approval of at least 51% of our Members then at the level of President’s Team earning at the production bonus level of 6% who vote, provided that at least 50% of those Members entitled to vote do in fact vote. We initiate these types of changes based on the assessment of what will be best for us and our Members and then submit such changes for the requisite vote. We believe that this agreement has strengthened our relationship with our existing Members, improved our ability to recruit new Members and generally increased the long-term stability of our business.
 Structure
 To become a Member in most markets a person must be sponsored by an existing Member and must purchase an Herbalife Member Pack, or HMP (referred to as an International Business Pack, or IBP, in the United States and Puerto Rico). The HMP is a Member kit available in local languages which typically includes product samples, a handy tote, booklets describing the Company, our compensation plan and rules of Member conduct, various training and promotional materials, Member applications and a product catalog. The price of an HMP varies by market and provides a low cost entry for incoming Members. HMPs do not generate any Member compensation and are not used for Member qualifications or recognition purposes under our Marketing Plan.
 Volume Points are point values assigned to each of our products for use by the Company to determine a Member’s sales achievement level. We assign a Volume Point value to a product when it is first introduced into a market and the value is unaffected by subsequent exchange rate and price changes. The specific number of Volume Points assigned to a product, generally consistent across all markets, is based on a Volume Point to suggested retail price ratio for similar products in the market. Management is evaluating our current approach to assigning and maintaining Volume Point values for certain products or markets. Any changes to this approach may have an impact on the use of Volume Points as a proxy for sales trends in future periods.
 To become a sales leader, or qualify for a higher level, Members must achieve specified Volume Point thresholds of product sales or earn certain amounts of royalty overrides during specified time periods and generally must re-qualify once each year. Qualification criteria can vary somewhat by market. As previously disclosed, in recent years we simplified our qualification criteria and created a longer-term, 12-month qualification method to encourage more gradual qualification. We believe a gradual qualification approach is important to the success and retention of new sales leaders and benefits the business in the long term as it allows new Members to obtain product and customer experience as well as additional training and education on Herbalife products, daily consumption based DMOs, and the business opportunity prior to becoming a sales leader.
 12


Members, with the exception of those in China and our preferred members, earn the right to receive royalty overrides upon attaining the level of sales leader and above, and production bonuses upon attaining the level of Global Expansion Team and above. Once a Member becomes a sales leader, he or she has the opportunity to qualify by earning specified amounts of royalty overrides for the Global Expansion Team, the Millionaire Team or the President’s Team, and thereby receives production bonuses. We believe that the opportunity for Members to earn royalty overrides and production bonuses contributes significantly to our ability to retain our most active and productive Members.
 The method for calculating distributor allowances and Marketing Plan payouts generally utilizes 90% to 95% of suggested retail price, depending on the product and market, to which we apply discounts of up to 50% for distributor allowances and payout rates of up to 15% for royalty overrides, up to 7% for production bonuses, and approximately 1% for the Mark Hughes bonus.
 Our business model in China includes unique features as compared to our traditional business model in order to ensure compliance with Chinese government regulations. These include Company operated retail stores and certification procedures for sales personnel when necessary. These and other features of our business model in China have resulted in, and will continue to result in, substantial ongoing costs.
 Sales Leader Re-qualification and Retention
 Our compensation system requires each sales leader to re-qualify for such status each year, prior to February, in order to maintain their 50% discount on products and be eligible to receive royalty payments. In February of each year, we demote from the rank of sales leader those Members who did not satisfy the re-qualification requirements during the preceding twelve months. The re-qualification requirement does not apply to new sales leaders (i.e. those who became sales leaders subsequent to the January re-qualification of the prior year). Volume Points are the basis for sales leader qualification. Typically, a Member accumulates Volume Points for a given sale at the time the Member pays for the product. However, effective beginning in May 2017, a Member does not receive Volume Point credit for a transaction in the United States until it is documented in compliance with the consent order entered into with the FTC.
 The table below reflects the number of sales leaders as of the end of February of the year indicated (subsequent to the annual re-qualification process) and sales leader retention rate by year and by region.
 
 
 | Number of Sales Leaders | | Sales Leaders Retention Rate
-------------------------------+-------------------------+---------+-----------------------------
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | 2017 | 2016 | | | 2015
North America | | 61,362 | | 79,305 | | 88,866 | | 74.8 | % | | 58.3 | % | 58.4 | %
Mexico | | 74,968 | | 67,294 | | 83,137 | | 71.7 | % | | 57.1 | % | 56.7 | %
South & Central America | | 73,375 | | 77,523 | | 88,392 | | 55.2 | % | | 53.0 | % | 52.0 | %
EMEA | | 101,101 | | 87,500 | | 82,025 | | 62.2 | % | | 63.6 | % | 68.4 | %
Asia Pacific (excluding China) | | 124,555 | | 107,871 | | 127,252 | | 49.7 | % | | 43.8 | % | 43.9 | %
Total Sales Leaders | | 435,361 | | 419,493 | | 469,672 | | 60.9 | % | | 54.2 | % | 54.2 | %
China | | 47,244 | | 41,890 | | 32,222 | | | | | | | | 
Worldwide Total Sales Leaders | | 482,605 | | 461,383 | | 501,894 | | | | | | | | 

 The number of sales leaders as of December 31 will exceed the number immediately subsequent to the preceding re-qualification period because sales leaders qualify throughout the year but sales leaders who do not re-qualify are removed from the rank of sales leader the following February.
 For the latest twelve month re-qualification period ending January 2018, approximately 63.6% of our sales leaders, excluding China and Venezuela, re-qualified. Certain markets have instituted a lower re-qualification threshold, and this figure includes the effect of the lower threshold. The retention rate for 2018, if calculated absent the lower threshold for those markets, would have been 59.7%, which represents a slight decline from the comparable figure for the period ending January 2017 of 60.9%. With the new business requirements described above in place for U.S. and U.S. Territories, we have introduced a re-qualification equalization factor for U.S. Members to better align their re-qualification thresholds with Members in other countries. We believe this factor preserves retention rate comparability across markets and time periods. Excluding the impact of both the lower re-qualification thresholds and the equalization factor in the U.S. and U.S. Territories, the retention rate for 2018 would have been 58.6%. Venezuelan Members were excluded from retention figures for all years presented as sales leaders in the market were not required to requalify for the years ended January 2018 and January 2016 due to product supply limitations, 2017 retention figures are not comparable to other periods or markets due to revised requalification criteria, and 2015 demotion figures were amplified due to reinstatement of the qualification requirement after having been waived for 2014. Argentina is excluded from 2016 and 2015; demotion figures were amplified for 2016 due to reinstatement of the qualification requirement after having been waived for 2015.
 13


Despite the slight decline in the sales leader retention rate for 2018, we believe the prior trend of increases in the rate in recent years is the result of efforts we have made to improve the sustainability of sales leaders’ businesses such as encouraging Members to obtain experience retailing Herbalife products before becoming a sales leader. As our business operations continue to evolve, including the establishment of a distinct “preferred member” category of Member in certain markets and changes in sales leader re-qualification thresholds for other markets, management is evaluating the importance of sales leader retention rate information for the future.
 PRODUCT RETURN AND BUYBACK POLICIES
 In substantially all markets, our products include a customer satisfaction guarantee. Under this guarantee, any customer or preferred member who is not satisfied with an Herbalife product for any reason may return it or any unused portion of it within 30 days from the time of receipt to the Member from whom it was purchased for a full refund or credit toward the exchange of another Herbalife product. In markets outside of the United States, if they return the products to us on a timely basis, the Member may obtain replacement product from us for such returned products. In addition, in substantially all jurisdictions, we maintain a buyback program pursuant to which we will repurchase products sold to a Member who has decided to leave the business. The buyback program has certain terms and conditions that may vary by market, but it generally permits the return of unopened and marketable condition products or sales materials purchased within the prior twelve month period in exchange for a refund of the net price paid for the product and, in some markets, the original cost of shipment to the Member. Together, product returns and buybacks were approximately 0.1% of product sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
REGULATION
 General
 In both our United States and foreign markets, we are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations and guidance, court decisions and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations and other constraints exist at the federal, state or local levels in the United States and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions, including regulations pertaining to: (1) the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of our products; (2) product claims and advertising, including direct claims and advertising by us, as well as claims and advertising by Members, for which we may be held responsible; (3) our network marketing program; (4) transfer pricing and similar regulations that affect the level of U.S. and foreign taxable income and customs duties; (5) taxation of our Members (which in some instances may impose an obligation on us to collect the taxes and maintain appropriate records); and (6) currency exchange and repatriation.
Products
 In the United States, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, holding, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies, including (1) the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, (2) the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, (3) the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, (4) the United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA, (5) the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, (6) the United States Postal Service, (7) United States Customs and Border Patrol, and (8) the Drug Enforcement Administration. Our activities also are regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, distributed or sold. The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacture and labeling of over-the-counter, or OTC, drugs, conventional foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics such as those distributed by us. The majority of the products marketed by us in the United States are classified as conventional foods or dietary supplements under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA. Internationally, the majority of products marketed by us are classified as foods, health supplements or food supplements.
 FDA regulations govern the preparation, packaging, holding and distribution of foods, OTC drugs and dietary supplements. Among other obligations, they require us and our contract manufacturers to meet relevant current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations for the preparation, packaging, holding, and distribution of OTC drugs and dietary supplements. The FDA also requires identity testing of all incoming dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements, unless a company successfully petitions for an exemption from this testing requirement in accordance with the regulations. The cGMPs are designed to ensure that OTC drug and dietary supplement products are not adulterated with contaminants or impurities, and are labeled to accurately reflect the active ingredients and other ingredients in the products. Herbalife has regularly implemented enhancements, modifications and improvements to our manufacturing and corporate quality processes and believes we and our contract manufacturers are compliant with the FDA’s cGMP and other applicable manufacturing regulations in the United States.
 14


The U.S. Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, or DSHEA, revised the provisions of FFDCA concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements. Under DSHEA, dietary supplement labeling may display structure/function claims that the manufacturer can substantiate, which are claims that the products affect the structure or function of the body, without prior FDA approval, but with notification to the FDA. They may not bear any claim that they can prevent, treat, cure, mitigate or diagnose disease (a drug claim). In addition, the agency permits companies to use FDA-approved full and qualified health claims for products containing specific ingredients that meet stated requirements.
 U.S. law also requires that all serious adverse events occurring within the United States involving dietary supplements or OTC drugs be reported. We believe that we are in full compliance with this law having implemented a worldwide procedure governing adverse event identification, investigation and reporting. As a result of reported adverse events, we may from time to time elect, or be required, to remove a product from a market, either temporarily or permanently.
 Some of the products marketed by us are considered conventional foods and are currently labeled as such. Within the United States, this category of products is subject to the federal Nutrition, Labeling and Education Act, or NLEA, and regulations promulgated under the NLEA. The NLEA regulates health claims, ingredient labeling and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in the product. The ingredients in conventional foods must either be generally recognized as safe by experts or be approved as food additives under FDA regulations.
 The federal Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA, is also applicable to some of our business. We follow a food safety plan and have implemented preventive measures required by the FSMA. Foreign suppliers of our raw materials are also subject to FSMA requirements, and we have implemented a verification program to comply with the FSMA. Dietary supplements manufactured in accordance with cGMPs and foods manufactured in accordance with the low acid food regulations are exempt.
 In foreign markets, prior to commencing operations and prior to making or permitting sales of our products in the market, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the relevant country’s ministry of health or comparable agency. Where a formal approval, license or certification is not required, we nonetheless seek the advice of counsel regarding our compliance with applicable laws. Prior to entering a new market in which a formal approval, license or certificate is required, we work extensively with local authorities in order to obtain the requisite approvals. The approval process generally requires us to present each product and product ingredient to appropriate regulators and, in some instances, arrange for testing of products by local technicians for ingredient analysis. The approvals may be conditioned on reformulation of our products, or may be unavailable with respect to some products or some ingredients.
 The FTC, which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of all of our products in the United States, has in the past several years instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement and food companies and against manufacturers of weight loss products generally for false and misleading advertising of some of their products. In addition, the FTC has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials, which we also utilize, as well as the role of expert endorsers and product clinical studies. We cannot be sure that the FTC, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question our advertising or other operations in the future.
 In Europe, where an EU Health Claim regulation is in effect, the European Food Safety Authority, or EFSA, issued opinions following its review of a number of proposed claims dossiers. ESFA’s opinions, which have been accepted by the European Commission, are having a limiting effect on the use of certain nutrition-specific claims made for our products. Herbalife has revised affected product labels to ensure regulatory compliance. Until all modified labels are in the marketplace, there is the possibility that one or more EU member states could take enforcement action.
 We are subject to a permanent injunction issued in October 1986 pursuant to the settlement of an action instituted by the California Attorney General, the State Health Director and the Santa Cruz County District Attorney. We consented to the entry of this injunction without in any way admitting the allegations of the complaint. The injunction prevents us from making specified claims in advertising of our products, but does not prevent us from continuing to make specified claims concerning our products, provided that we have a reasonable basis for making the claims. The injunction also prohibits certain recruiting-related investments from Members and mandates that payments to Members be premised on retail value (as defined); the injunction provides that the Company may establish a system to verify or document such compliance.
 15


Network Marketing Program
 Our network marketing program is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the FTC and various state agencies as well as regulations in foreign markets administered by foreign agencies. Regulations applicable to network marketing organizations generally are directed at ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within the organization is based on sales of the organization’s products rather than investments in the organization or other non-retail sales related criteria. When required by law, we obtain regulatory approval of our network marketing program or, when this approval is not required, the favorable opinion of local counsel as to regulatory compliance.
 On July 15, 2016, we reached a settlement with the FTC and entered into a proposed Stipulation to Entry of Order for Permanent Injunction and Monetary Judgment, or the Consent Order, which resolved the FTC’s multi-year investigation of us. The Consent Order became effective on July 25, 2016, or the Effective Date, upon final approval by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Pursuant to the Consent Order, we agreed to implement certain new procedures and enhance certain existing procedures in the U.S., most of which we had 10 months from the Effective Date to implement. Among other requirements, the Consent Order requires us to categorize all existing and future Members in the U.S. as either “preferred members” – who are simply consumers who only wish to purchase product for their own household use, or “distributors” – who are Members who wish to resell some products or build a sales organization. We also agreed to compensate distributors on U.S. eligible sales within their downline organizations, which include purchases by preferred members, purchases by a distributor for his or her personal consumption within allowable limits and sales of product by a distributor to his or her customers. The Consent Order also requires distributors to meet certain conditions before opening Nutrition Clubs and/or entering into leases for their Herbalife business in the United States. The Consent Order also prohibits us from making expressly or by implication, any representation regarding the amount or level of income, including full-time or part-time income that a participant can reasonably expect to earn in our network marketing program, unless the representation is non-misleading and we possess competent and reliable evidence sufficient to substantiate that the representation is true.
 The Consent Order also prohibits us and other persons who act in active concert with us from representing that participation in the network marketing program will result in a lavish lifestyle and from using images or descriptions to represent or imply that participation in the program is likely to result in a lavish lifestyle. In addition, the Consent Order prohibits specified misrepresentations in connection with marketing the program, including misrepresentations regarding any fact material to participation such as the cost to participate or the amount of income likely to be earned. The Consent Order also requires us to clearly and conspicuously disclose all information material to participation in the marketing program, including our refund and buyback policy.
 We intend to continue to monitor the impact of the Consent Order regularly and our Board of Directors has established the Implementation Oversight Committee in connection with the Consent Order. The committee has met and will meet regularly with management to oversee our compliance with the terms of the Consent Order. While we currently do not expect the settlement to have a long-term and materially adverse impact on our business and our Member base, our business and our Member base, particularly in the U.S., have been and may continue to be negatively impacted as we and they adjust to the changes.
 On January 4, 2018, the FTC released its nonbinding Business Guidance Concerning Multi-Level Marketing, or MLM Guidance, to assist multi-level marketers, or MLMs, apply core consumer protection principles applicable to the multi-level marketing industry to their business practices. For example, the MLM Guidance explains lawful and unlawful compensation structures, the treatment of personal consumption by participants in determining if an MLM’s compensation structure is unfair or deceptive, and how an MLM should approach representations to current and prospective participants. We believe our current business practices, which include new and enhanced procedures implemented in connection with the Consent Order, are in compliance with the MLM Guidance.
 Additionally, the FTC has promulgated nonbinding Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, or Guides, that explain how the FTC interprets Section 5 of the FTC Act’s prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Consequently, the FTC could bring a Section 5 enforcement action based on practices that are inconsistent with the Guides. Under the Guides, advertisements that feature a consumer and convey his or her atypical experience with a product or service are required to clearly disclose the results that consumers can generally expect. Herbalife has adapted its practices and rules regarding the practices of its Members to comply with the revised Guides and to comply with the Consent Order.
 16


The terms of the Consent Order do not change our going to market through direct selling by independent distributors, and compensating those distributors based upon the product they and their sales organization sell. We have implemented new and enhanced procedures required by the terms of the Consent Order and will continue to do so; however, the terms of the Consent Order and the ongoing costs to comply therewith could adversely affect our business operations, our results of operations and our financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of risks related to the settlement with the FTC.
 We also are subject to the risk of private party challenges to the legality of our network marketing program both in the United States and internationally. For example, in Webster v. Omnitrition International, Inc., 79 F.3d 776 (9th Cir. 1996), the network marketing program of Omnitrition International, Inc., or Omnitrition, was challenged in a class action by Omnitrition distributors who alleged that it was operating an illegal “pyramid scheme” in violation of federal and state laws. We believe that our network marketing program satisfies federal and other applicable statutes and case law.
 In some countries, regulations applicable to the activities of our Members also may affect our business because in some countries we are, or regulators may assert that we are, responsible for our Members’ conduct. In these countries, regulators may request or require that we take steps to ensure that our Members comply with local regulations. The types of regulated conduct include: (1) representations concerning our products; (2) income representations made by us and/or Members; (3) public media advertisements, which in foreign markets may require prior approval by regulators; (4) sales of products in markets in which the products have not been approved, licensed or certified for sale; and (5) classification by government agencies of our Members as employees of the Company.
 In some markets, it is possible that improper product claims by Members could result in our products being reviewed by regulatory authorities and, as a result, being classified or placed into another category as to which stricter regulations are applicable. In addition, we might be required to make labeling changes.
 We also are subject to regulations in various foreign markets pertaining to social security assessments, employment and severance pay requirements, import/export regulations and antitrust issues. As an example, in some markets, we are substantially restricted in the amount and types of rules and termination criteria that we can impose on Members without having to pay social security assessments on behalf of the Members and without incurring severance obligations to terminated Members. In some countries, we may be subject to these obligations in any event.
 It is an ongoing part of our business to monitor and respond to regulatory and legal developments, including those that may affect our network marketing program. However, the regulatory requirements concerning network marketing programs do not include bright line rules and are inherently fact-based. An adverse judicial determination with respect to our network marketing program could have a material adverse effect to our financial condition and operating results. An adverse determination could: (1) require us to make modifications to our network marketing program, (2) result in negative publicity, or (3) have a negative impact on Member morale. In addition, adverse rulings by courts in any proceedings challenging the legality of network marketing systems, even in those not involving us directly, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 As has been reported in the national media, a hedge fund manager publicly raised allegations regarding the legality of our network marketing program. We believe, based in part upon guidance to the general public from the FTC, that our network marketing program is compliant with applicable law.
 Transfer Pricing and Similar Regulations
 In many countries, including the United States, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by our U.S. or local entities and are taxed accordingly. In addition, our operations are subject to regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of customs duties are assessed on the importation of our products.
 Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions, we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed. For example, we are currently subject to pending or proposed audits that are at various levels of review, assessment or appeal in a number of jurisdictions involving transfer pricing issues, income taxes, duties, value added taxes, withholding taxes and related interest and penalties in material amounts. In some circumstances, additional taxes, interest and penalties have been assessed, and we will be required to appeal or litigate to reverse the assessments. We have taken advice from our tax advisors and believe that there are substantial defenses to the allegations that additional taxes are owed, and we are vigorously defending against the imposition of additional proposed taxes. The ultimate resolution of these matters may take several years, and the outcome is uncertain.
 17


In the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to us, we may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of U.S. foreign tax credits. The laws and regulations governing U.S. foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment and are not available with respect to all of the Company’s foreign income taxes. Additionally, U.S. Tax Reform creates additional restrictions on the utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits. Therefore, we cannot be sure that we would in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future.
 Compliance Procedures
 As indicated above, Herbalife, our products and our network marketing program are subject, both directly and indirectly through Members’ conduct, to numerous federal, state and local regulations, both in the United States and foreign markets. Beginning in 1985, we began to institute formal regulatory compliance measures by developing a system to identify specific complaints against Members and to remedy any violations of Herbalife’s rules by Members through appropriate sanctions, including warnings, fines, suspensions and, when necessary, terminations. In our manuals, seminars and other training programs and materials, we emphasize that Members are prohibited from making therapeutic claims for our products.
 Our general policy is to reject Member applications from individuals who do not reside in one of our approved markets.
 In order to comply with regulations that apply to both us and our Members, we conduct considerable research into the applicable regulatory framework prior to entering any new market to identify all necessary licenses and approvals and applicable limitations on our operations in that market. Typically, we conduct this research with the assistance of local legal counsel and other representatives. We devote substantial resources to obtaining the necessary licenses and approvals and bringing our operations into compliance with the applicable limitations. We also research laws applicable to Member operations and revise or alter our Member manuals and other training materials and programs to provide Members with guidelines for operating a business, marketing and distributing our products and similar matters, as required by applicable regulations in each market. We are, however, unable to monitor our Members effectively to ensure that they refrain from distributing our products in countries where we have not commenced operations, and we do not devote significant resources to this type of monitoring.
 In addition, regulations in existing and new markets often are ambiguous and subject to considerable interpretive and enforcement discretion by the responsible regulators. Moreover, even when we believe that we and our Members are initially in compliance with all applicable regulations, new regulations regularly are being added and the interpretation of existing regulations is subject to change. Further, the content and impact of regulations to which we are subject may be influenced by public attention directed at us, our products or our network marketing program, so that extensive adverse publicity about us, our products or our network marketing program may result in increased regulatory scrutiny.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 8,300 employees, of which approximately 2,400 were located in the United States. These numbers do not include our Members, who are independent contractors. In certain countries, which include China and Mexico, we have employees who are subject to labor union agreements and there have been no significant business interruptions as a result of any labor disputes.
