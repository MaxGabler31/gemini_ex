Overview
 CTG was incorporated in Buffalo, New York on March 11, 1966, and its corporate headquarters are located at 800 Delaware Avenue, Buffalo, New York 14209 (716-882-8000). CTG is an IT solutions and staffing services company with operations in North America, Europe, and India. CTG’s employees and billable subcontractors total approximately 4,150 people worldwide. During 2018, the Company had nine operating subsidiaries: Computer Task Group of Canada, Inc., providing services in Canada; Computer Task Group Belgium N.V., CTG ITS S.A., Computer Task Group IT Solutions, S.A., Computer Task Group Luxembourg PSF, Computer Task Group (U.K.) Ltd., CTG Health Solutions N.V., and Soft Company SAS (“Soft Company”) each primarily providing services in Europe; and Computer Task Information Technology Private Services Limited, providing services in India.

 The Company primarily operates in one industry segment, providing IT services to its clients. These services include IT solutions and IT and other staffing. With IT solutions services, we generally take responsibility for the deliverables on a project and the services may include high-end consulting.

The Company at times provides administrative or warehouse employees to clients to supplement the IT staffing resources we place at those clients.

Vertical Markets
 The Company promotes a majority of its services through five vertical market focus areas: technology service providers, manufacturing, healthcare (which includes services provided to healthcare providers, health insurers (payers), and life sciences companies), financial services, and energy. The remainder of CTG’s revenue is derived from general markets.
 CTG’s revenue by vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:
 
 
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
-----------------------------+------+-------+---+------+-------+-----
Technology service providers | | 32.4 | % | | 33.1 | % | 35.2 | %
Manufacturing | | 19.5 | % | | 24.3 | % | 24.2 | %
Healthcare | | 16.2 | % | | 16.8 | % | 18.2 | %
Financial services | | 15.2 | % | | 9.1 | % | 7.8 | %
Energy | | 4.7 | % | | 5.0 | % | 5.3 | %
General markets | | 12.0 | % | | 11.7 | % | 9.3 | %
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 
Revenue for the Company's technology service providers vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased in 2018 as compared with 2017 due, in part, to a change in business mix as the Company began to sell more of its solutions services which are not included in this vertical market. The decrease was also due to a reduction in demand from several of the Company’s largest clients in its IT and other staffing services business, which are included in this vertical market. Revenue from IBM, our largest client, which is included in this vertical market, increased in 2018 as compared with 2017, but was offset by declines at other large clients. The revenue as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased for 2017 as compared with 2016 due to a change in business mix. Demand from this vertical market began to slow in the 2016 fourth quarter as several large clients cut back on their requirements for our services due to their challenging financial results. 
 The revenue in our manufacturing vertical market is primarily generated from several large staffing clients, including Lenovo (through SDI as a vendor manager for Lenovo) which is our second largest client. Revenue from Lenovo decreased in 2018 as compared with 2017 due to a decrease in demand for the Company’s services.
 In 2018, the demand from our healthcare clients increased, but at a rate that was less than the overall revenue increase for the Company, which caused the percentage of total revenue to decrease. This increase was a reversal in trend as compared with reductions in 2017 and 2016 as revenue in those years fell due to the completion of electronic health records (EHR) and related projects was not offset through new engagements.
 Revenue for the Company’s financial services vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased in 2018 as compared with 2017 due to the addition of Soft Company in February 2018, which provides a large portion of its services to the financial services market. Revenue in this vertical market also increased in 2017 as compared with 2016 as the Company experienced significant organic growth in our European operations where most of the services provided to the financial services vertical market are performed.

Revenue for the Company's energy vertical market decreased as a percentage of consolidated revenue in 2018 given the revenue increase in this vertical market was less than the growth in other vertical markets. Revenue as a percentage of total decreased in 2017 as compared with 2016, as demand in this vertical market declined. Generally, the decrease in the price of oil caused several of our clients to reduce their overall spending, including requirements for IT services, in 2017 and 2016.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, CTG provided its services to 451 clients in North America and Europe. In North America, the Company operates in the United States and Canada, with greater than 99% of 2018 North American revenue generated in the United States. In Europe, the Company operates in Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom. Of total 2018 consolidated revenue of $358.8 million, approximately 65% was generated in North America and 35% in Europe. One client, IBM, accounted for greater than 10% of CTG’s consolidated revenue in 2018.
 Revenue Recognition and Backlog
 The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised good or service is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. For time-and-material contracts, revenue is recognized as hours are incurred and costs are expended. For contracts with progress billing schedules, primarily monthly, revenue is recognized as services are rendered to the customer. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized over time using an input-based approach. Over time revenue recognition best portrays the Company’s performance in transferring control of the goods or services to the customer. On most fixed price contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that require the customer to pay for work performed to date, including cost plus a reasonable profit margin, for goods or services that have no alternative use to the Company. On certain contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that indicate the customer controls the asset, or work in process, as the Company creates or enhances the asset. On a given project, actual salary and indirect labor costs incurred are measured and compared with the total estimate of costs of such items at the completion of the project. Revenue is recognized based upon the percentage-of-completion calculation of total incurred costs to total estimated costs. The Company infrequently works on fixed-price projects that include significant amounts of material or other non-labor related costs that could distort the percent complete within a percentage-of-completion calculation. The Company’s estimate of the total labor costs it expects to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our experience on similar projects, and includes management judgments and estimates that affect the amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts in any accounting period.  Losses on fixed-price projects are recorded when identified.
 The Company’s revenue from contracts accounted for under time-and-material, progress billing, and percentage-of-completion methods as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:
 
 
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
-------------------------+------+-------+---+------+-------+-----
Time-and-material | | 84.7 | % | | 85.9 | % | 86.5 | %
Progress billing | | 10.5 | % | | 10.8 | % | 10.8 | %
Percentage-of-completion | | 4.8 | % | | 3.3 | % | 2.7 | %
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the backlog for fixed-price and all managed-support contracts was approximately $52.0 million and $30.4 million, respectively. Approximately 59% or $30.4 million of the December 31, 2018 backlog is expected to be earned in 2019. Approximately 54% of the $30.4 million of backlog at December 31, 2017, or $16.3 million, was earned in 2018. Revenue is subject to slight seasonal variations, with a minor slowdown and a decrease in billable resource utilization in months of high vacation and legal holidays (July, August, and December). Backlog does not tend to be seasonal; however, it does fluctuate based upon the timing of entry into long-term contracts.

Competition
 The IT services market, for both IT solutions and IT staffing services, is highly competitive. The market is also highly fragmented with many providers and no single competitor maintaining clear market leadership. Competition varies by location, the type of service provided, and the client to whom services are provided. The Company’s competition comes from four major channels: large national or international companies, including major accounting and consulting firms and large companies headquartered in India; hardware vendors and suppliers of packaged software systems; small local firms or individuals specializing in specific programming services or applications; and from a client’s internal IT staff. CTG competes against all four of these channels for its share of the market. The Company believes that to compete successfully it is necessary to have a local geographic presence, offer appropriate IT solutions, provide skilled professional resources, and price its services competitively.
Intellectual Property
 The Company has registered its symbol and logo with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and has taken steps to preserve its rights in other countries where it operates. We regard patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely on them in the United States and foreign countries to protect our investments in products and technology. Our patents expire at various times, but we believe that the loss or expiration of any individual patent would not materially affect our business. We, like any other company, may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties from time to time in the ordinary course of business. CTG has entered into agreements with various software and hardware vendors from time to time in the normal course of business, and has capitalized certain costs under software development projects.
Employees
 CTG’s business depends on the Company’s ability to attract and retain qualified professional staff to provide services to its clients. The Company has a structured recruiting organization that works with its clients to meet their requirements by recruiting and providing high quality, motivated staff. As the Company works with a number of subcontractors with Soft Company, which was acquired on February 15, 2018, the Company now includes subcontractors in its total headcount, which equals approximately 4,150 employees worldwide, with approximately 2,950 in the United States and Canada and 1,200 in Europe. Of these employees, approximately 3,800 are IT professionals and 350 are individuals who work in sales, recruiting, delivery, administrative and support positions. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good. No employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. CTG is an equal opportunity employer.
