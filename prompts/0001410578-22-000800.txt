Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a developer of advanced physical security technologies focused on enhancing U.S. security operations. Knightscope designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and supports Autonomous Security Robots (“ASRs”) with real-time on-site data collection and analysis and a proprietary interface for both indoor and outdoor usage. In addition, we developed and operate the Knightscope Security Operations Center (“KSOC”) which allows real-time data access, a service accessible to all our clients.
We are a Delaware Corporation, founded in April 2013. Our worldwide headquarters are located at 1070 Terra Bella Ave, Mountain View, CA 94043 and our telephone number is (650) 679-7626.
Strategy
Our primary focus is on the development, deployment, and marketing of our core technologies which are designed to be a force multiplier, offering improved situational awareness to security professionals and are suitable for most environments that require security patrol coverage. We sell our solutions under an annual subscription, Machine-as-a-Service (“MaaS”) business model, which includes the ASR rental as well as maintenance, service, support, data transfer, KSOC access, docking stations, and unlimited software, firmware and select hardware upgrades. Our current strategy is to focus on servicing the United States for the foreseeable future before considering global expansion.
Industry background
In the United States, there are more than 8,000 private security firms and over 19,000 law enforcement agencies – a fragmented marketplace relying primarily on human beings for monitoring and patrol activities. We believe that our products offer a better economic proposition for our clients relative to a human guard or a mobile vehicle patrol unit operating 24/7, enabling security professionals to focus on strategic decision-making.
Products
ASRs
The K3 and K5 are designed to roam a geo-fenced area autonomously by utilizing numerous sensors and lasers, either on a random basis or based on a particular patrolling algorithm. They can successfully navigate around people, vehicles and objects in dynamic indoor or outdoor environments. To do this, the ASRs employ several autonomous motion and self-driving technologies, including lasers, ultrasonic sensors, inertial measurement unit (“IMU”), and wheel encoders as well as a robust navigation software stack. Each ASR can generate 1 to 2 terabytes of data per week and over 90 terabytes of data per year, which is accessible for review and analysis via the KSOC. Clients can recall, review, and save the data for analysis, forensic or archival purposes. Each ASR can autonomously charge and recharge on a 24-hour basis, 7 days per week without human intervention. Clients may also utilize the patrol scheduler feature on the KSOC to schedule periodic or regular patrols during certain times for alternative patrol routes.
The dimensions of the K5 are as follows: Height: 5 feet, Width: 3 feet, Weight 398 pounds.
The K5 is designed to be used primarily outdoors in such environments as open air malls, corporate campuses, hospitals, stadiums, retailers, warehouses, logistics facilities, college campuses, airports, train stations and multi-level parking structures. The K5’s advanced anomaly detection features include:

● | 360-degree high-definition night and day video capture positioned at eye-level;

● | Parking meter feature, which assesses the top 10 vehicles and their “dwell time” in a particular location. If a vehicle is parked for more than 24 hours in the same location, a user can receive an alert or have the data flagged. The parking meter feature can also track the top 10 stationary vehicles in an area and accurate parking meter readout for each such vehicle;

The dimensions of the K3 are as follows: Height: 4 feet, Width: 2 feet, Weight 340 pounds.
The K3 is tailored for indoor usage, allowing it to autonomously navigate complex dynamic indoor environments such as an indoor mall, office building, manufacturing facility, hospital, stadium plaza, warehouse or school. It has the same suite of advanced anomaly detection capabilities as the K5, but the parking utilization, parking meter and license plate recognition features are turned off.
The ASRs include several communications features. The units can transfer data over both 4G LTE networks and Wi-Fi as well as future 5G capabilities. Each one has an available intercom that may be used for two-way communication with a security team. In addition, one or multiple units may be used as a live broadcast public address system or to deliver pre-recorded messages.
The ASRs run on rechargeable batteries. They are configured to patrol autonomously for approximately two to three hours, following which, without human intervention, the ASRs find and dock to a charging station, recharging for approximately 20 minutes or more before resuming patrol. The ASRs remain operational during the charging period, providing 24/7 uptime to clients.
The K1 carries all the relevant features from the K3 and K5 but in a stationary format. In 2020, the Company added elevated body temperature sensing capabilities to this model. The K1 can be used indoors or outdoors and especially at ingress/egress points for both people and vehicles.
The dimensions of the K1 are: Height 5.75 feet, Width 2.7 feet, Weight: 150 pounds.
KSOC
The KSOC is our intuitive, browser-based interface that, coupled with ASRs, provides security professionals with “smart mobile eyes and ears and voice – on the ground” Once alerted of an abnormal event, such as a person spotted during a specific time in a particular location, authorized users can view the live stream of data in the KSOC from each of the ASRs in the user’s network, accessing it from a security operations center or a remote laptop.
Products in Development
The Company is in the process of developing the 5th generation of the K5, which is planned for initial release later in 2022, as well as the 2nd generation K1. In addition, the K7 multi-terrain ASR is under development. The K7 is expected to have the same features as the K5, but to employ four wheels for use on more rugged outdoor terrain such as dirt, sand, and gravel. We expect that the K7 could be utilized at airfields, power utilities, borders, solar farms, wind farms or oil or gas fields. While this technology builds on a great deal of our technology stack, we anticipate that its development will require additional time before it can be launched into full-scale production. Additionally, we have begun work on version 7.0 of the KSOC.

KNOC
The Company has built a custom set of tools that enables it to manage and monitor the network of ASRs operating in the field nationwide, which it refers to as the Knightscope Network Operations Center (“KNOC”). These tools allow our team to monitor the health of the ASRs down to the millisecond, with dozens of alerts related to critical indicators and statistics, including charging, software, navigation and temperatures. We also use the KNOC to execute over-the-air software upgrades, patches and other related items. The KNOC is staffed 24/7 by the Company in the U.S.
Additionally, the Company offers “Knightscope+” remote monitoring as an optional service that can be bundled into its MaaS subscriptions, primarily for clients that operate without a fully staffed 24/7 Security Operations Center (“SOC”).
Clients
Knightscope’s products are designed to supplement the work of security professionals and are suitable for most environments that require security patrol coverage. In the United States, there are more than 8,000 private security firms and over 19,000 law enforcement agencies – a fragmented marketplace that we believe offers numerous opportunities for disruption.
Knightscope’s ASRs provide our clients with the ability to augment their existing security infrastructure, enabling human security resources to be more strategic in their approach to security. Our MaaS solution has been deployed across a broad range of clients, including but not limited to casinos, corporations, law enforcement, and property management companies. In addition, Knightscope continues to partner with strategic resellers for our ASRs, such as large security companies looking to augment the security solutions offered to their customers with advanced technology.
Sales and Marketing
We market our products at trade shows both live and virtual, including GSX, ISC West, ISC East as well as Company-sponsored private events and on-site private demonstrations during the pre-pandemic period. The Company has been able to successfully sell new contracts through virtual private demonstrations during the pandemic and has embarked on an innovative “Robot Roadshow” beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021. The initiative entails a cross country tour of a physical “Pod” housing numerous ASRs providing a one-on-one hybrid offline/online selling technique with in-person robots and telepresence sales staff. Furthermore, we have significantly increased resources dedicated to achieving an Authority-to-Operate ("ATO") from the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program ("FedRamp"), targeted for approximately the end of 2022. The federal government adopted the Cloud First Policy, which requires all cloud service providers that hold federal data to be FedRamp certified. FedRamp compliance will enable federal agencies to do business with Knightscope.
We regularly advertise in the media through various online and offline channels.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts focus primarily on the development of robust base technology as well as scaling efforts. In addition, we will continue to enhance our ASRs’ capabilities, features and functionality of the KSOC software platform, and develop a four-wheel version of our ASR technology, the K7, which is intended to operate in a wider range of challenging terrains. In 2021, we commenced the FedRamp certification process, which is expected to continue throughout 2022 and will require ongoing support thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Intellectual Property
The Company holds nine patents collectively covering its ASRs, the security data analysis and display features of the KSOC and its parking monitor feature. The Company also has pending patent applications relating to its ASRs, KSOC, parking monitor feature, behavioral autonomous technology and the ASRs’ behavioral autonomous technology relating to visible weapon detection. The Company owns a trademark registration for its name “Knightscope” in the U.S. On August 10, 2021, the Company filed two trademark applications (Serial Numbers: 90875695 for LONG KNIGHTSCOPE. SHORT THE CRIMINALS and 90875697 for $KSCP). The Company relies and expects to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, and third parties with whom it has relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect its proprietary rights.

Manufacturing and Suppliers
Knightscope assembles its ASRs at its Mountain View, California headquarters from components manufactured by more than 75 suppliers. The Company’s top three suppliers, measured by spending, are Kaman Automation, Inc., Inc., based in Indiana, Fast Radius, based in Illinois, and E and M Electric and Machinery Inc., based in California. The Company is not highly dependent on any one supplier and believes it can source components from other suppliers and has done so when necessary. Under pre-pandemic conditions, the manufacturing lead-time for two-thirds of the Company’s components is 30 to 60 days or less, with the remainder requiring up to 90 days. Current lead times for certain components and systems are consistent with pre-pandemic lead times for a portion of the bill-of-material. With the onset of supply chain constraints, the Company has experienced delays on a few key components and increased requirements to pre-pay for certain raw material. The Company has taken certain countermeasures including, but not limited to, adjusting production schedules, renegotiating supply agreements, re-designing systems, using multiple worldwide brokers, and purchasing larger quantities of key parts in advance. Despite our efforts to minimize the impact of supply chain limitations on our operations during 2021, we expect to continue to experience some delays in our ability to build and deploy ASRs to our clients during 2022 due to global supply chain constraints, including, but not limited to, the impact of the continuing conflict in the Ukraine.
In order optimize our ability to serve our clients, we have partnered with one of our strategic investors, Konica Minolta, Inc., to train their technicians to service, maintain and support our machines-in-network and assist us with our nationwide scaling efforts.
Competition
At the moment, we are not aware of any direct competitors in the advanced physical security technology space that have viable commercial products in the United States, outdoors and indoors, at the same scale as Knightscope with actual paying clients. It is a common misconception among some people outside of the security industry that we compete against closed-circuit television (CCTV) providers. They are not, in fact, competitive products because cameras do not provide a physical presence, are typically used for forensics after an event, and do not offer a client the plethora of capabilities available in an ASR/KSOC combination. We believe that having these two types of systems working together provide a more holistic approach to promoting safety and reducing crime. While traditional human guards provide a closer comparator or competitor in some cases, we believe that utilizing our “Software+Hardware+Humans” approach is much more effective.
We are aware of a start-up, SMP Robotics Services Corp. (“SMP”), which produces an outdoor autonomous security platform that it markets through third-party distributors and is now primarily focused on international markets. We had previously listed Gamma 2 Robotics and SHARP Electronics as potential competitors in this space. However, according to industry sources, we understand that both Gamma 2 Robotics and SHARP Electronics have ceased operations in the security robot space after failed attempts to enter the market, and SMP also ceased efforts with its North American distributor. Cobalt Robotics, a start-up exclusively focused on indoor applications, may be considered a partial competitor, although its products are not fully autonomous and more of a telepresence security guard offering. Additionally, Turing AI has recently begun offering an indoor-only robot and Robotic Assistance Devices has continued to grow its stationary fixed device offerings, similar to other fixed solutions, such as those offered by Verkada.
We compete indirectly with private physical security firms that provide clients with security personnel and other security services. Our ASRs offer clients a significant cost reduction relative to the cost of human security guards. In addition, ASRs offer significantly more capabilities, such as license plate detection, data gathering, thermal imaging and people detection that are delivered consistently, on a 24-hour, 7 day per week basis, without regular human intervention. In certain cases, our technology complements and improves the operations of traditional security firms.
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, including those governing antitrust and competition, the environment, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of covered electronic products and components.
In addition, a number of data protection laws impact, or may impact, the manner in which we collect, process and transfer personal data. U.S. laws that have been applied to protect user privacy (including laws regarding unfair and deceptive practices) may be subject to evolving interpretations or applications in light of privacy developments. Compliance with enhanced data protection laws requires additional resources and efforts, and noncompliance with personal data protection regulations could result in increased regulatory enforcement and significant monetary fines and costs.

Backlog and Seasonality
As of March 18, 2022, we had orders representing approximately $1.7 million in sales outstanding, all of which related to services that we expect to deliver within one year. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had orders representing approximately $1.1 million and $0.7 million in sales outstanding, respectively.
We have not experienced any significant effects relating to seasonality for our products and services.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 55 full-time employees working primarily out of our combined headquarters and production facility in Mountain View, California. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
The Company believes that our future growth and success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled employees. The executive management team is responsible for developing and executing the Company’s human capital strategy. The human capital strategy includes the attraction, acquisition, engagement, and development of the Company’s employees, which are fundamental to executing on our strategy and key to the design of employee compensation and benefits programs required to fit the needs of our employees. The CEO regularly updates the Company’s board of directors on key areas of our human capital strategy, including the following:
Diversity and Inclusion: The Company’s management team and board of directors believes in the benefits workforce diversity can provide. Innovation is critical for any technology company – and we believe that it benefits by the creative thinking that happens when people with different perspectives and backgrounds come together. We believe diverse teams can better relate to the many and varied needs of our Clients. We promote a culture where individual differences are valued which also allows us to attract the very best talent further encouraging our people to reach their full potential.
We are committed to taking action on employee feedback and have implemented both corporate and business group action plans to address employee concerns. Further, we are committed to making all benefit and employment-related decisions in compliance with established equal employment opportunity statutes and without regard to religion, national origin, age, gender, race, color, ancestry, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, citizenship, pregnancy, medical condition or any other protected class status, as defined by local, state or federal laws.
We believe strongly in building a workforce that is diverse and that can build strong working relationships with our Clients. We support an inclusive culture and motivate our workforce to be themselves while at work. We are committed to providing our employees with a positive and safe work environment that is free of discrimination, harassment, and workplace violence. We encourage our employees to embrace different ideas, strengths, interests, and cultural backgrounds. Professional development and inclusion are important to us.
Health and Safety: Health, safety, and the well-being of our employees is one of our top priorities. We strive to achieve world-class safety levels on an annual basis. Our safety culture focuses on reducing workplace injuries and is supported by effective communication and reporting of workplace injuries. To protect our employees in facilities in which our teams operate, we have employed preventative measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees. We ensure our preventative measures are in compliance with the most recent local governmental regulations and requirements. These preventative measures not only apply to our physical operations, but also to health and safety measures implemented to address the COVID-19 Pandemic.
