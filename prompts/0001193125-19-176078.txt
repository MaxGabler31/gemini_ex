ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
-------------------

General 
 Barnes & Noble, Inc. (Barnes & Noble or the Company), one of the nations largest booksellers,1 provides customers a unique experience across its omni-channel distribution platform. As of April 27, 2019, the Company operates 627 bookstores in 50 states, maintains an eCommerce site, develops digital reading products and operates NOOK, one of the largest digital bookstores. Barnes & Noble is utilizing the strength of its retail footprint in combination with its online and digital businesses to provide an omni-channel experience for its customers, fulfilling its commitment to offer customers any book, anytime, anywhere and in any format. 
 Barnes & Noble Retail (B&N Retail) operates 627 retail bookstores, primarily under the Barnes & Noble Booksellers® trade name, and includes the Companys eCommerce site. B&N Retail also includes Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. (Sterling or Sterling Publishing), a leader in general trade book publishing. The NOOK segment represents the Companys digital business, offering digital books and magazines for sale and consumption online, NOOK®2 reading devices, co-branded NOOK® tablets and reading software for iOS, Android and Windows. As of April 27, 2019, the Company employed approximately 24,000 employees (7,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time employees). 
 The Companys principal business is the sale of trade books (generally hardcover and paperback titles), mass market paperbacks (such as mystery, romance, science fiction and other popular fiction), childrens books, eBooks and other digital content, NOOK® and related accessories, bargain books, textbooks, magazines, gifts, café products and services, educational toys & games, music and movies direct to customers through its bookstores or on www.barnesandnoble.com. 
 Barnes & Noble has been experiencing declining sales trends primarily due to lower store traffic. The Company has been able to offset some of the traffic decline through its efforts to increase conversion through higher customer engagement as well as increase average transaction values through better merchandise offerings. Additionally, the Company has been able to partially mitigate the impact of the sales decline on profit levels through cost reductions. Recently, the Company began to reinvest some of its cost savings into initiatives to grow its top line sales, including an advertising campaign and increased promotional offers, which contributed to a comparable store sales increase during the third quarter of the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019 (fiscal 2019). While the Company believes it has lost share on its sales performance, it sees opportunities in an industry that has become more stable. 
 To improve its performance, the Companys strategic plan is focused on strengthening its core business by enhancing its customer value proposition; improving profitability through an aggressive expense management program, which will be redeployed to fund growth initiatives; and innovating for the future, which will position the Company for long-term growth. 
 To strengthen its core business, the Company is focused on enhancing its customer value proposition by improving its merchandise offerings, enriching the overall shopping experience, increasing the value of its Membership Program and expanding its omni-channel capabilities. The Company will continue to leverage the strength of its Barnes & Noble brand, knowledgeable booksellers, vast book selection, omni-channel offering and retail footprint to attract customers and grow sales.

Merchandising initiatives are focused on increasing the impact of promotional activities, narrowing product assortments, improving SKU productivity, refining inventory management processes, testing changes to existing store layouts and remerchandising select business units. The Company believes there is opportunity to increase conversion through higher customer engagement and by improving navigation and discovery throughout the store. Additionally, the Company believes its reinvigorated marketing efforts, which include improved email campaigns and new advertising campaigns, can help improve store traffic trends. 
 In-store events also drive traffic, reinforcing Barnes & Noble as a destination where customers can meet, browse and discover. The Company has launched new events, such as the Barnes & Noble Book Club, which was designed to bring readers in communities across the country together to discuss some of the most compelling books being published. To generate interest in these and other events, the Company is also utilizing social media, where booksellers communicate events, promotions and new product offerings with customers at the local level in order to drive additional traffic. 
 The Companys Membership Program provides the Company with valuable data and insights into its customer base, enabling the Company to better understand and market to its customers. Members are more productive than non-members, as they spend more and visit more often. The Company continues to test programs to grow sales to both members and non-members, increase membership, improve price perception and enhance its overall customer value proposition. 
 The Company is focused on simplification throughout its organization to create efficiencies and reinvest resources to support sales growth. The Company is also committed to right sizing its cost structure. At B&N Retail, the Company implemented a new labor model for its stores, increasing store productivity and streamlining store operations. At NOOK, the Company exited non-core businesses and outsourced certain functions. NOOK expects to continue to re-calibrate its cost structure commensurate with sales. 
 In addition to initiatives focused on growing sales through its existing store base, the Company is innovating for the future and is opening newly designed prototype stores, which it believes could foster sales growth in the future. 
 The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1986. 
 Merger Agreement 
 On June 6, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Chapters Holdco Inc., a Delaware corporation (Parent), and Chapters Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (Merger Sub). Subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the Merger), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub were formed by affiliates of Elliott Associates, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and Elliott International, L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership. 
 The Board of Directors of the Company approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby following the recommendation of a special committee consisting solely of independent and disinterested directors, to which the Board of Directors of the Company had delegated authority to consider and negotiate the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Voting Agreement (as described below) and the transactions contemplated thereby). 
 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each share of the Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Company Common Stock) (other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including as treasury stock, or by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, which will be cancelled and cease to exist, and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock for which stockholders have exercised statutory appraisal rights and which will be entitled to the appraised value thereof, if applicable, pursuant to Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL)), will be converted into the right to receive cash in the amount of $6.50. 
 The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of calendar year 2019, and is subject to certain mutual conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, voting together as a single class, (ii) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and (iii) the absence of any order or law that has the effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the closing (subject to customary materiality qualifiers) and (ii) the compliance by the other party in all material respects with its pre-closing obligations under the Merger Agreement. Parents and Merger Subs respective obligations to consummate the Merger are also conditioned upon the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Closing of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. 
 In connection with the Merger Agreement, on June 6, 2019, Parent, Leonard Riggio, the Companys Founder and Chairman, and certain stockholders affiliated with Mr. Riggio (the Significant Stockholders), and, solely for purposes of certain provisions, the Company entered into a Voting and Support Agreement (the Voting Agreement) pursuant to which the Significant Stockholders agreed, among other things and subject to certain conditions, to, at any meeting of stockholders of the Company called to vote upon the approval of the Merger, vote all shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by such Significant Stockholders in favor of the Merger, and to vote against certain other matters, so long as such obligations have not terminated in accordance with the terms set forth therein. 
 The Company and Parent have agreed to cooperate with each other in good faith to use their reasonable best efforts to negotiate an amendment to the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable providing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement through a tender offer and merger structure in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL. The amendment to the Merger Agreement is conditioned upon the simultaneous amendment to the Voting Agreement providing that the shares of Company Common Stock held by the Significant Stockholders be tendered in the tender offer. 
 The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the Voting Agreement and each description of the Merger Agreement or Voting Agreement contained herein does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement or Voting Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 or Exhibit 10.1, as applicable, to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 7, 2019. 
 Segments 
 The Company identifies its operating segments based on the way the business is managed (focusing on the financial information distributed) and the manner in which the chief operating decision maker interacts with other members of management and makes decisions on the allocation of resources. The Companys two operating segments are B&N Retail and NOOK. 
 B&N Retail 
 This segment includes 627 bookstores as of April 27, 2019, primarily under the Barnes & Noble Booksellers trade name. These Barnes & Noble stores generally offer a comprehensive trade book title base, a café, departments dedicated to Kids and Young Adults, Toys & Games, DVDs, Music & Vinyl, Gift, Magazine and Bargain products, and a dedicated NOOK® area. The stores also offer a calendar of ongoing events, including author appearances and childrens activities. The B&N Retail segment also includes the Companys eCommerce website, www.barnesandnoble.com, and its publishing operation, Sterling Publishing. 
 Barnes & Noble stores range in size from 2,800 to 60,000 square feet depending upon market size, with an overall average store size of approximately 26,000 square feet. In fiscal 2019, the Company reduced the Barnes & Noble store base by approximately 172,000 square feet, bringing the total square footage to 16.4 million square feet, a net reduction of 1.0% from fiscal 2018.

The Company believes that the key elements contributing to the success of B&N Retail are: 
 Proximity to Customers. The Companys strategy has been to increase its share of the consumer book market, as well as to increase the size of the market through a market clustering strategy. As of April 27, 2019, Barnes & Noble had stores in 161 of the total 210 Designated Market Area markets. In 68 of the 161 markets, the Company has only one Barnes & Noble store. The Company believes its bookstores proximity to its customers strengthens its market position and increases the value of its brand. Most Barnes & Noble stores are located in high-traffic areas with convenient access to major commercial thoroughfares and ample parking. Most stores offer extended shopping hours seven days a week. 
 Extensive Title Selection. Each Barnes & Noble store features an authoritative selection of books, ranging from approximately 19,000 to 133,000 unique titles with an average overall title base of 66,000 per store. The comprehensive title selection is diverse and reflects local interests and regional titles and authors works. Bestsellers typically represent between approximately 5% and 6% of Barnes & Noble store sales. Complementing this extensive on-site selection, all Barnes & Noble stores provide customers with access to the millions of books available to online shoppers at www.barnesandnoble.com by offering an option to have the book sent to the store or shipped directly to the customer. Additionally, the website allows customers to purchase over three million eBooks, digital magazines and newspapers. The Company believes that its tremendous selection, including many otherwise hard-to-find titles, builds customer loyalty. 
 Store Design and Ambiance. Many of the Barnes & Noble stores create a comfortable atmosphere with ample public space, a café offering sandwiches, soups and bakery items, among other things, and public restrooms. The cafés, for which the Starbucks Corporation is the sole provider of coffee products, foster the image of the stores as a community meeting place. In addition, the Company continues to develop and introduce new product line extensions, such as proprietary gifts and the B&N Educator Program, providing education tools for teachers, librarians and parents. These offerings and services have helped to make many of the stores neighborhood institutions. 
 Educational Toys & Games Department. The Educational Toys & Games Department at Barnes & Noble offers parents and gift-givers unique, best in class, learning products from around the world. In addition to an exceptional educational assortment, customers can rely on Barnes & Noble for many of the most requested top toys in any season. Whether customers are browsing Science & Tech, Arts & Crafts or Kids Games & Puzzles, there is consistently something new to discover. At Barnes & Noble, customers can shop in three distinct ways: by brand, by category and by age. And, by showcasing powerful brands, along with favorite characters, the Company has become a destination for kids and gift-givers across the country. 
 Games, Puzzles, Trend & Collectibles. Barnes & Noble continues to maintain focus on Games & Puzzles with a thoughtful and deliberate merchandising segmentation. Featuring an assortment of puzzles, family games, strategy games, party games, card games and mind, memory and logic games, Barnes & Noble offers table top gaming products allowing customers to immerse themselves in dynamic game-play. In the ever evolving world of pop culture, Barnes & Noble is proud to offer trend-based merchandise for an array of fans through an inspired collection of products from many of the hottest entertainment properties, featuring many of the latest trends from around the globe and the Companys most revered book franchises. 
 NOOK® Demonstrations. The Company has utilized its traditional retail bookstores to promote NOOK® within the bookstores. Customers have the ability to see, feel, and experiment with NOOK®, speak to knowledgeable booksellers, and receive pre- and post-sales customer support within the Companys bookstores. The Company offers NOOK® owners free NOOK® support in all of its retail bookstores, as well as free Wi-Fi connectivity to enjoy the Read In Store feature to read NOOK Books for free within the

 store. These acclaimed devices, which provide a fun, easy-to-use and immersive reading experience, include the NOOK® Tablets, Samsung Galaxy Tab® A NOOK®, Samsung Galaxy Tab® E NOOK®, NOOK® GlowLight® 3 and NOOK® GlowLight Plus® devices. The NOOK® devices have also opened up an additional market for NOOK®-related accessories such as stands, covers, lights, and other items. 
 Music and Movies & TV Departments. Many of the Barnes & Noble stores have Music and Movies & TV departments, which offer CDs, Vinyl LPs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs. These departments range in size up to approximately 7,800 square feet and typically stock approximately 7,000 titles. The Companys DVD and Blu-ray selection focuses on current and classic movies, documentaries, fitness and instructional titles, British TV series and movies, and foreign films. The music selection is tailored to the tastes of the Companys customers, centering on classical music, jazz, pop rock, and show tunes. The Company also offers a strong selection of Vinyl titles, available in all stores, along with turntables. 
 Discount Pricing. Barnes & Noble stores employ an aggressive nationwide discount pricing strategy and offer special promotions throughout the year. The Barnes & Noble Membership Program offers members greater discounts and other benefits for products and services as well as exclusive offers and promotions via email or direct mail. The Companys website, www.barnesandnoble.com, also utilizes a competitive model that includes various promotional offerings designed for members and non-members alike and enables the Company to offer better value to its customers. The Barnes & Noble Kids Club Program offers free rewards and special offers to participants and invites children to celebrate their birthday within the retail bookstores. 
 Community Business Development. The Companys retail bookstores host a variety of national and local events, which feature the many products and services it offers. Each store plans its own community-based calendar of events, including author appearances, childrens storytimes, poetry readings and book discussion groups. In addition, the Company hosts a number of national campaigns around various themes or audiences such as National Book Club, Summer Reading, My Favorite Teacher Essay Contest, Educator Appreciation Days and the annual Holiday Book Drive, which provides books to at risk children in the communities the stores serve. All of these campaigns increase traffic and sales, and further reinforce Barnes & Noble as a community center. 
 The Company also provides fund-raising opportunities through its Bookfair program for schools and local non-profit arts and literacy organizations, as well as a Holiday Gift Wrap program, which allows non-profit organizations to gain exposure and raise funds while wrapping gifts inside the stores. The Company believes its community business development programs encourage customer loyalty, drive sales and traffic into its stores and provide positive publicity and media coverage. 
 Merchandising and Marketing. The Companys merchandising strategy for its Barnes & Noble stores is to be the authoritative community bookstore carrying an extensive selection of titles in all subjects, including an extensive selection of titles from small independent publishers and university presses. Each Barnes & Noble store features an extensive selection of books. Each store is tailored to reflect the lifestyles and interests of the areas customers. 
 Product Master, the Companys authoritative data repository system, provides each store with comprehensive title selections. By enhancing the Companys existing merchandise replenishment systems, Product Master allows the Company to achieve higher in-stock positions and better productivity at the bookstore level through efficiencies in receiving, cashiering and returns processing. Complementing this extensive on-site selection, all Barnes & Noble stores provide customers with access to the millions of books available to online shoppers at www.barnesandnoble.com by offering an option to have the book sent to the store or shipped directly to the customer.

The Company has an omni-channel eCommerce marketing strategy that deploys various merchandising programs and promotional activities to drive traffic to both its stores and website. At the center of this eCommerce program is the Companys website, www.barnesandnoble.com. The website serves as both the Companys direct-to-home delivery service and as an important broadcast channel and advertising medium for the Barnes & Noble brand. For example, the online store locator at www.barnesandnoble.com receives millions of customer visits each year providing store hours, directions, information about author events and other in-store activities. Similarly, in Barnes & Noble stores, NOOK® customers can access free Wi-Fi connectivity and enjoy the Read In Store feature to browse many complete eBooks for free. 
 The Company has implemented a number of new website features to improve the overall user experience. The Buy Online, Pick up in Store (BOPIS) initiative allows customers to place an order online and pick it up within one hour at the selected store. This option is available in all Barnes & Noble stores around the country and provides customers with a convenient alternative to shop. BN.com is an important component of the Companys omni-channel strategy, and it believes that, in the long-term, the platform will enable it to be more competitive in the marketplace. 
 Another example of an omni-channel initiative is the Barnes & Noble MasterCard®, a co-brand credit card issued by Barclaycard. Card members earn 5% back on purchases at any Barnes & Noble store or online at www.barnesandnoble.com. They also earn points for every dollar spent on purchases where MasterCard is accepted (excluding Barnes & Noble purchases); when they reach 2,500 points, they automatically earn a $25 Barnes & Noble gift card. Customers can apply in any B&N store or online at BN.com. Upon approval, they can use the new account to receive the 5% statement credit rebate on their B&N purchase, as well as a $25 Barnes & Noble gift card after first use of the account.
 The Company believes that its website complements its bookstores in many ways. It not only serves as a marketing tool, it offers convenient shopping alternatives for its customers. 
 Brand Reputation. In 2018, the Reputation Institute named Barnes & Noble the most reputable retailer in America. The Company attained the #1 position based on its strongest emotional connection and on the key drivers of reputation, such as governance and citizenship. According to the Reputation Institute, the survey quantifies the emotional bond stakeholders have with leading companies and how these connections drive supportive behavior such as the willingness to purchase a companys products, recommend the brand, invest or work for the company.                 
 Store Locations and Properties. The Companys experienced real estate personnel select sites for new Barnes & Noble stores after an extensive review of demographic data and other information relating to market potential, bookstore visibility and access, available parking, surrounding businesses, compatible nearby tenants, competition and the location of other Barnes & Noble stores. Most stores are located in high-visibility areas adjacent to main traffic corridors in strip shopping centers, freestanding buildings and regional shopping malls. The real estate personnel continue to focus on renegotiating leases as they expire.

Sterling Publishing 
 Sterling Publishing is a leading publisher of non-fiction trade titles. Founded in 1949, Sterling publishes a wide range of non-fiction and illustrated books and kits across a variety of imprints, in categories such as health & wellness, music & popular culture, food & wine, crafts, puzzles & games and history & current affairs, as well as a large childrens line. Sterling, with a solid backlist and robust value publishing program, has a title base of approximately 13,000 print books and eBooks. In addition, Sterling also distributes approximately 1,500 titles on behalf of client publishers. 
Operations 
 The Company has seasoned management teams for its retail stores, including those for real estate, merchandising and store operations. Field management includes regional vice presidents and district managers supervising multiple store locations. 
 During fiscal 2018, the Company implemented a new labor model for its stores, increasing store productivity and streamlining store operations. 
 
9 
 
The Barnes & Noble management team is led by experienced management in both traditional product lines and in digital eCommerce. The Barnes & Noble management team employs highly skilled professionals with both media expertise and supply chain management skills. This combination ensures a positive customer experience regardless of a customers preference for a physical product or a digital one. 
 Each Barnes & Noble store generally employs a store manager, one assistant store manager, two sales and inventory managers, a café manager and on average 31 booksellers (combination of full-time and part-time). Many Barnes & Noble stores also employ a full-time community business development manager. The large bookseller base provides the Company with experienced employees to fill new manager positions in the Companys Barnes & Noble stores. The Company anticipates that a significant percentage of the personnel required to manage its stores will continue to come from within its existing operations. 
 Field management for all of the Companys bookstores, including regional vice presidents, district managers and store managers, participate in an annual incentive program tied to store sales and profit goals (for regional vice presidents) as well as execution of certain retail initiatives. The Company believes that the compensation of its field management is competitive with that offered by other specialty retailers of comparable size. 
 Barnes & Noble has in-store training programs providing specific information needed for success at each level, beginning with the entry-level positions of bookseller. District managers participate in annual training and merchandising conferences. Store managers are generally responsible for training other booksellers and employees in accordance with detailed procedures and guidelines prescribed by the Company utilizing a blended learning approach, including on-the-job training, eLearning, facilitator-led training and training aids available at each bookstore. 
 Purchasing 
 Barnes & Nobles buyers and vendor management team negotiate costs, marketing funds, promotional discounts, cooperative advertising and showroom allowances with publishers and other suppliers for www.barnesandnoble.com and all of the Companys bookstores. The Company has buyers and allocation managers who specialize in customizing inventory for bookselling in stores and online. Store inventories are further customized by store managers, who may respond to local demand by purchasing a limited amount of fast-selling titles through a nationwide wholesaling network, including the Companys distribution centers. 
 The Companys B&N Retail segment purchases physical books on a regular basis from over 500 publishers and over 30 wholesalers or distributors. Purchases from the top five suppliers (including publishers, wholesalers and distributors) accounted for approximately 70% of the B&N Retails book purchases during fiscal 2019, and no single supplier accounted for more than 29% of B&N Retails book purchases during this period. Consistent with industry practice, a substantial majority of the physical book purchases are returnable for full credit, a practice which substantially reduces the Companys risk of inventory obsolescence. 
 Distribution 
 The Company has invested significant capital in its systems and technology by building new platforms, implementing new software applications and building and maintaining efficient distribution centers. This investment has enabled the Company to source a majority of its inventory through its own distribution centers, resulting in direct buying from vendors rather than wholesalers. Using the Companys own distribution centers rather than wholesalers lowers distribution costs per unit, increases inventory turns, and improves product margins. The Companys distribution centers 3-prong strategy of (1) accelerating speed to market, (2) improving order quality (on-time, complete and damage free) and (3) reducing costs has improved just-in-time deliveries to stores as well as deliveries to the Companys customers on orders placed via the Barnes & Noble website and through the Companys in-store order network. 
 
10 
 
As of April 27, 2019, the Company has approximately 1,745,000 square feet of distribution center capacity. The Company has an approximately 1,145,000 square foot distribution center in Monroe Township, New Jersey, which ships merchandise to stores throughout the country and to online customers. The Company also has an approximately 600,000 square foot distribution center in Reno, Nevada, which is used to facilitate distribution to stores and online customers in the western United States. 
 Information Technologies 
 The Company has focused a majority of its information technology resources on strategically positioning and implementing systems to support store operations, online technology requirements, merchandising, distribution, marketing and finance.
 BookMaster, the Companys proprietary bookstore inventory management system, integrates point-of-sale features with a proprietary data warehouse-based replenishment system. BookMaster enhances communications and real-time access to the Companys network of bookstores, distribution centers and wholesalers. The Company continues to implement systems to improve efficiencies in back office processing in the human resources, finance and merchandising areas. 
 The Company plans to continue to invest in technologies that will enable it to offer its customers the more convenient and user-friendly online shopping experience. B&N Retail has licensed existing commercial technology when available and has focused its internal development efforts on those proprietary systems necessary to provide the highest level of service to its customers. The overall mix of technologies and applications allows the Company to support a distributed, scalable and secure eCommerce environment. 
 The Company uses Intel®-based server technology in a fully redundant configuration to power its current website, which is hosted on two Company-owned data centers in leased facilities. Each of these data centers has sufficient capacity to independently support the volume of traffic directed toward the Companys website during peak periods. Both hosting data centers are configured with redundant power, Internet telecommunications capacity and cooling to significantly reduce its exposure to downtime and service outages. Additionally, the Company believes its technology investments are scalable to meet the future growth demands of the business. 
 Competition 
 The book business is highly competitive in every channel in which the Company operates. The Company competes with mass merchandisers, such as Costco, Target and Wal-Mart. The Company faces competition from many online distributors, notably Amazon.com. The Company also competes with other large bookstores, including Books-A-Million, and smaller format bookstores, including new Amazon retail stores and independent store operators. In addition, the Company faces competition from digital distributors, such as Amazon.com and Apple, including through digital books or eBooks and eBook readers. The B&N Retail businesss stores also compete with specialty retail stores that offer books in particular subject areas, variety discounters, drug stores, warehouse clubs, mail-order clubs and other retailers offering books, music, toys, games, gifts and other products in its market segments. 
 The music and movie businesses are also highly competitive and the Company faces competition from mass merchants, discounters and electronic distribution. The store experience is geared towards the Companys customer base, including a strong Blu-ray presence as well as a tailored, returnable product assortment.

Seasonality 
 The B&N Retail business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating income realized during its third fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. 
Employees 
 The Company cultivates a culture of outgoing, helpful and knowledgeable employees. As of April 27, 2019, the B&N Retail segment had approximately 24,000 employees (7,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time employees). The B&N Retail segments employees are not represented by unions. 
NOOK 
 This segment represents the Companys digital business, including the development and support of the Companys NOOK® product offerings. The digital business includes digital content such as eBooks, digital newsstand and sales of NOOK® devices and accessories to B&N Retail. The underlying strategy of the NOOK business is to offer customers any digital book, newspaper or magazine, anytime, on any device. The Company remains committed to delivering to customers the best digital bookstore experience, providing easy access to Barnes & Nobles expansive digital collection of over three million eBooks, digital magazines and newspapers, while rationalizing its existing cost structure. As part of this commitment, the Company partners with Samsung to develop co-branded NOOK® tablets that feature the award-winning Barnes & Noble digital reading experience, while continuing to develop and offer its own NOOK® Tablets and E-Ink NOOK® eReaders. 
 Barnes & Nobles NOOK digital bookstore and Reading Apps provide customers the ability to purchase and read their digital content and access their Lifetime Library on a wide range of digital platforms, including Windows PCs and tablets, iPad, iPhone®, Android smartphones and tablets, PC and Mac®. Barnes & Noble has implemented innovative features on its digital platform to ensure that customers can access their NOOK content from almost all of todays most popular devices. 
 NOOK currently sells a number of different devices to satisfy customers digital needs, including NOOK® Tablets, Samsung Galaxy Tab® A NOOK®, Samsung Galaxy Tab® E NOOK®, NOOK® GlowLight® 3 and NOOK® GlowLight Plus® devices. The NOOK® and Samsung tablets provide customers access to the millions of books, newspapers and magazines in the NOOK Store and through Google Play, Android apps and games, songs, movies and TV shows, plus popular Google services like the Chrome browser, Gmail, YouTube, Google Search and Google Maps. NOOK GlowLight® devices provide customers a simple, easy to use, intuitive eReader on an E-Ink display that replicates the experience of reading from physical paper and provides access to the Companys digital content store. Free NOOK support in any of the B&N Retail bookstores provides customers the ability to interact with a knowledgeable bookseller to receive pre- and post-customer sales support. Barnes & Noble stores also provide free Wi-Fi connectivity for NOOK® devices and Read In Store access, which allows customers to read NOOK Books for free within the store. NOOK also allows for digital lending of a wide selection of books through its LendMe® technology. 
Operations 
 The digital products group has knowledgeable product development and operational management teams in the areas of reading software, digital content retailing and mobile device development. Digital product management oversees product concept, software development, engineering, and user experience. Operational management has historically overseen demand planning, strategic sourcing, manufacturing, return and refurbishment of hardware. The Company expects that digital product managements role will continue to focus on eReading devices and reading platforms, while also managing third-party partner relationships, such as NOOKs partnership with Samsung and Bahwan CyberTek (BCT), a global software products and services company, in which the Company outsourced certain NOOK functions, including cloud management and development support for NOOK® software.

Purchasing/Distribution 
 NOOK acquires the rights to distribute digital content from publishers and distributes the content on www.barnesandnoble.com, NOOK® devices and other eBookstore platforms. Certain digital content is distributed under an agency pricing model, in which the publishers set fixed prices for eBooks and NOOK receives a fixed commission on content sold through the eBookstore. The majority of the Companys eBooks sold are under the agency model. 
 NOOK utilizes the Companys purchasing power and its distribution centers to synergistically facilitate the purchasing and shipping of devices and accessories.
 Competition 
 The eReader and tablet businesses are highly competitive. NOOK competes primarily on price, device functionality, consumer appeal and availability of digital content. The importance of price varies depending on the competitor, with some of NOOKs competitors engaging in significant discounting and other promotional activities. NOOK competes with many online digital businesses, notably Amazon.com and Apple. Some of the Companys competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources and may have different business strategies than NOOK does. 
Seasonality 
 The NOOK business, like that of many technology companies, is impacted by the launch of new products and the promotional efforts to support those new products, as well as the traditional retail holiday selling seasonality.
Employees 
 As of April 27, 2019, NOOK had 38 employees (combination of full-time and part-time). NOOK employees are not represented by unions, and the Company believes that its relationship with its employees is generally excellent.
