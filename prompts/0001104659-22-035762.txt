ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial business combination. We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risk associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
On March 9, 2021, we consummated an initial public offering of 34,500,000 units, including the 4,500,000 units as a result of the underwriter’s exercise of its over-allotment option in full, at an offering price of $10.00 per unit and a private placement with our Sponsor of 7,800,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant. The gross proceeds from our initial public offering, together with certain of the proceeds from the private placement, totaled $345,000,000 in the aggregate.
We are seeking to capitalize on the investment experience of our management team, which consists of technology entrepreneurs as well as technology-oriented investors with a shared vision of identifying and investing in technology companies. We are also deeply experienced in identifying omni-channel trends that we believe are even more important in a COVID and post-COVID world. We believe that our management team’s relationships with leading technology company founders, executives of private and public companies, venture capitalists and growth equity fund managers and its ability to identify and implement value creation initiatives, in particular via marketing optimization gives us a competitive advantage. Our team has been immersed in the same ecosystem as the current founders of private companies who are making decisions on how to build currency for future growth and monetization.
While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business, industry or geographical location, we intend to focus our search within the high-growth technology and direct-to-consumer sectors. We intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate a business or businesses that can benefit from our management team’s established relationships and operating experience. Our management team has extensive experience in identifying and executing strategic investments and has done so successfully in a number of sectors, particularly in digital consumer-facing businesses.
Our Management Team and Board of Directors Philip Krim, our Chairman, has served as Casper Sleep Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer and as a member of its board of directors since October 2013. Since founding the Company in 2013, Mr. Krim has led Casper through tremendous growth, growing revenue from $15 million in 2014 to $497 million in 2020 (approximately 79% CAGR), and successfully took the company public in February 2020. Prior to that, Mr. Krim was the Chief Executive Officer of Vocalize Mobile, a mobile search advertising platform for small businesses, from January 2010 until July 2013, and the Chief Executive Officer of The Merrick Group from January 2003 until December 2009.
In addition to Mr. Krim, our board of directors includes private equity and venture capital veterans Chris Hollod, our Co-Chief Executive Officer (Founder and Managing Partner of Hollod Holdings), and Matt Eby, our Co-Chief Financial Officer (Co-Founder and former Managing Partner of Tengram Capital Partners). Additionally, our board of directors also benefits from the rich expertise of Wisdom Lu (Founding Partner of Stibel & Co. and Bryant Stibel), Tommy Stadlen (Co-Founder and General Partner at Giant Ventures), Boris Revsin (Managing Director and Head of Provate Capital at Repulic) and Michael Kim (Founder and Managing Partner of Cendana Capital).
In addition to our management team and board of directors, we have assembled a highly differentiated Advisory Board of accomplished founders and operators that will help position us as the value-add partner of choice for today’s leading entrepreneurs. The Advisory Board provides us significant advantages via their operational expertise and deep networks. Additionally, they provides deep domain expertise across our target sub-verticals which will be instrumental during our diligence processes. Our Advisory Board also provides us access to unique sourcing opportunities via their direct networks. Given the extensive operational experiences across our Advisory Board, our Advisors are able to provide guidance to our eventual target on how to best position the company for long term success.

​

Our Advisory Board is comprised of Alan Sheriff (Co-Founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Solebury Capital), Jeff Stibel (Founding Partner of Stibel & Co)., and David Dubick (General Partner of Codename Ventures).
With respect to the above, past performance of our management team or our Advisors is not a guarantee of either (i) success with respect to a business combination that may be consummated or (ii) the ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction. You should not rely on the historical record of management and its affiliates as indicative of future performance. Our management has no prior experience in operating blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies.
Our management team, sponsor, officers, directors and Advisors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. In addition, our officers, directors and Advisors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.
Proposed Business Combination
Merger Agreement
On October 28, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Tailwind Two, Merger Sub and Terran Orbital.
The Business Combination
The Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, the following transactions on the closing date: (i) Tailwind Two will become a Delaware corporation (the “Domestication”) and, in connection with the Domestication, (A) each outstanding Class A ordinary share of Tailwind Two will become one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Tailwind Two (the “New Terran Orbital Common Stock”), (B) each outstanding Class B ordinary share of Tailwind Two will become one share of New Terran Orbital Common Stock, (C) each outstanding warrant of Tailwind Two will become one warrant to purchase one share of New Terran Orbital Common Stock, and (D) the certificate of incorporation of Tailwind Two and the bylaws of Tailwind Two will be amended and restated; and (ii) following the Domestication, Merger Sub will merge with and into Terran Orbital, with Terran Orbital as the surviving company in the merger and, after giving effect to such merger, continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tailwind Two (the “Merger”) and Tailwind Two’s name will be changed to Terran Orbital Corporation.
The Domestication, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are hereinafter referred to as the “Business Combination.”
Merger Consideration
In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, issued and outstanding (i) shares of Terran Orbital (including any warrants of Terran Orbital which are exercised immediately prior to the Merger for shares of Terran Orbital in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement) will be converted into New Terran Orbital Common Stock, (ii) options to purchase shares of Terran Orbital (whether vested or unvested) will be cancelled in exchange for comparable options to purchase New Terran Orbital Common Stock, pursuant to the new incentive equity plan, and (iii) outstanding and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units of Terran Orbital (including Employee Retention Share RSUs and Employee Retention Share Restricted Stock described below) will be cancelled in exchange for comparable restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards to be settled in New Terran Orbital Common Stock pursuant to the new incentive equity plan.
Employee Retention Shares
In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement and Schedule 3.08 to the Merger Agreement, restricted stock and/or restricted stock units in respect of an aggregate of 197,2224 shares of Terran Orbital (such restricted stock, the “Employee Retention Share Restricted Stock,” and such restricted stock units, the “Employee Retention Share

​

RSUs”) will be awarded prior to the consummation of the Business Combination (the “Closing”) under the Amended and Restated Terran Orbital Corporation 2014 Equity Incentive Plan to certain persons designated by the compensation committee (the “Committee”) of the board of directors of Terran Orbital (the “Board”). The awards of Employee Retention Share RSUs and Employee Retention Share Restricted Stock will generally vest on the latest occur of: (i) the first anniversary of the Closing, (ii) the trading price of New Terran Orbital Common Stock equaling or exceeding $11.00 or $13.00 (the “Share Price Hurdles”), as applicable, for any 20 trading days within any consecutive 30-trading day period and (iii) such other performance vesting conditions, if any, determined by the Committee and approved by the Board, subject to the applicable person’s continued employment through the applicable vesting date; provided, however, that the awards of Employee Retention Share RSUs and Employee Share Restricted Stock will accelerate and vest on a change in control as defined in the new equity incentive plan provided the applicable Share Price Hurdles are met in connection with such change in control. The awards of Employee Retention Share RSUs and Employee Retention Share Restricted Stock will be subject to other terms and conditions (including, re-allocation upon forfeiture) as set forth in Schedule 3.08 to the Merger Agreement. In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, issued and outstanding (i) Employee Retention Share RSUs (outstanding and unvested) will be cancelled in exchange for comparable restricted stock units, based on the Exchange Ratio, to be settled in New Terran Orbital Common Stock (the “Rolled Employee Retention Share RSUs”) pursuant to the new incentive equity plan and (ii) Employee Retention Share Restricted Stock (outstanding and unvested) will be cancelled in exchange for comparable restricted stock, based on the Exchange Ratio, to be settled in New Terran Orbital Common Stock (the “Rolled Employee Retention Share Restricted Stock”) pursuant to the new incentive equity plan. Any awards of Rolled Employee Retention Share RSUs and Rolled Employee Retention Share Restricted Stock that do not vest during the five (5)-year period following the Closing will be automatically forfeited and cancelled for no consideration or other payment and no such expired Rolled Employee Retention Share RSUs or Rolled Employee Retention Share Restricted Stock may thereafter be awarded, re-allocated or available for issuance under the new incentive equity plan.

Termination
The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances prior to the Closing, including (i) by mutual written agreement of Tailwind Two and Terran Orbital, (ii) by Tailwind Two or Terran Orbital if any order is in effect or any law adopted that prohibits the consummation of the Business Combination, (iii) by Tailwind Two if the representations and warranties of Terran Orbital are not true and correct or if Terran Orbital fails to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in the Merger Agreement such that certain conditions to closing cannot be satisfied and the breach or breaches of such representations or warranties or the failure to perform such covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured or cannot be cured within certain specified time periods, (iv) by Terran Orbital if the representations and warranties of any of Tailwind Two or Merger Sub (each, a “Tailwind Two Party” and collectively, the “Tailwind Two Parties”) are not true and correct or if any Tailwind Two Party fails to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in the Merger Agreement such that certain conditions to closing cannot be satisfied and the breach or breaches of such representations or warranties or the failure to perform such covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured or cannot be cured within certain specified time periods, (v) subject to certain limited exceptions, by either Tailwind Two or Terran Orbital if the Business Combination is not consummated by April 28, 2022, (vi) by either Tailwind Two or Terran Orbital if Tailwind Two fails to obtain certain required approvals from Tailwind Two shareholders after the conclusion of a meeting of Tailwind Two’s shareholders held for such purpose, (vii) by Tailwind Two, if Terran Orbital does not deliver, or cause to be delivered to Tailwind Two the Written Consent on or prior to the deadline specified under the Merger Agreement and (viii) by Terran Orbital, at any time within five (5) business days following a Change in Recommendation (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
If the Merger Agreement is validly terminated, none of the parties to the Merger Agreement will have any liability or any further obligation under the Merger Agreement, except in the case of fraud and for customary obligations that survive the termination thereof (such as confidentiality obligations).
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Business Combination, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the respective parties made to each other as of the date of the Merger Agreement or other specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of the contract among the respective parties and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating such agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement are also modified in important part by the underlying disclosure schedules which are not filed publicly and which are subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable to shareholders and were used for the purpose of allocating risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Tailwind Two does not believe that these schedules contain information that is material to an investment decision.
Sponsor Agreement
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Tailwind Two, our sponsor, each other holder of Class B ordinary shares of Tailwind Two (the “Other Class B Shareholders”) and Terran Orbital entered into a sponsor agreement (the “Sponsor Agreement”), pursuant to which our sponsor and the Other Class B Shareholders (collectively, the “Sponsor Parties”) have agreed to, among other things, (i) consent to entering into the Merger Agreement, (ii) vote in favor of each of the transaction proposals to be voted upon at the meeting of Tailwind Two shareholders, including approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (iii) waive any adjustment to the conversion ratio set forth in Tailwind Two’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or any other anti-dilution or similar protection with respect to the Class B ordinary shares of Tailwind Two held by the Sponsor Parties and (iv) be bound by certain transfer restrictions with respect to his, her or its shares in Tailwind Two prior to the Closing, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Sponsor Agreement.

PIPE Financing (Private Placement)
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Tailwind Two entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”) and an affiliate of Mr. Daniel Staton, a director and shareholder of Terran Orbital (the “Insider PIPE Investor”, and together with the PIPE Investors, the “Investors”). Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, the Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and Tailwind Two agreed to issue and sell to such Investors, immediately prior to the Closing, an aggregate of 5,080,409 shares of New Terran Orbital Common Stock for a purchase price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $50.8 million (the “PIPE Financing”). The closing of the PIPE Financing is contingent upon, among other things, the substantially concurrent consummation of the Business Combination. The Subscription Agreements provide that Tailwind Two will grant the investors in the PIPE Financing certain customary registration rights. Tailwind Two will, within 45 days after the consummation of the Business Combination, file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) a registration statement registering the resale of such shares of New Terran Orbital Common Stock and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof
The Subscription Agreement for the Insider PIPE Investor contains a provision whereby in return for the Insider PIPE Investor’s $30.0 million investment in the PIPE Financing, the Insider PIPE Investor or its affiliate will receive a quarterly fee of $1.875 million for sixteen (16) quarters beginning at the end of the first quarter following the consummation of the Business Combination; the first years’ payments are to be paid in cash and the remaining payments are to be paid, subject to subordination to and compliance with the post-combination company’s debt facilities, in cash or stock at the discretion of the post-combination company.
The foregoing description of the Subscription Agreements and the PIPE Financing is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the forms of Subscription Agreement.
Terran Orbital Transaction Support Agreements
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain equityholders and noteholders of Terran Orbital (collectively, the “Terran Orbital Holders”) entered into transaction support agreements (collectively, the “Terran Orbital Holder Support Agreements”) with Tailwind Two and Terran Orbital, pursuant to which the Terran Orbital Holders have agreed to, among other things, (i) consent to and vote in favor of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) be bound by certain other covenants and agreements related to the Business Combination.
Lockheed Martin Corporation (“Lockheed Martin”) and Beach Point Capital (“Beach Point”), each of which are noteholders of Terran Orbital, have each further agreed, conditional upon certain other events, pursuant to the Terran Orbital Holder Support Agreements to, at their option, (a) exchange up to $25.0 million (in the case of Lockheed Martin) and $25.0 million (in the case of Beach Point) of aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes outstanding issued by Terran Orbital pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 8, 2021, by and among Terran Orbital, the guarantors party thereto, the purchasers party thereto and Lockheed Martin, as authorized representative (as amended, the “Existing Note Purchase Agreement”), for the same principal amount of debt to be issued under, and governed by a new loan agreement or note purchase agreement, which shall have substantially similar terms as the terms of the Facility (as defined below), except that such replacement loans or notes will not have call protection or (b) keep outstanding such amounts (up to $25.0 million (in the case of Lockheed Martin) and $25.0 million (in the case of Beach Point) of aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes outstanding) under the Existing Note Purchase Agreement ((a) and/or (b) collectively, the “Debt Rollover”).

Market Opportunity or Our Strategic and Target Industries
We believe that we are well positioned to identify attractive initial business combination opportunities across the technology and direct-to-consumer sectors. Our goal is to acquire a target that we can help achieve significant organic growth and could serve as a platform for future add on acquisitions with the goal of becoming an integrated provider offering a broad range of products or services across the technology ecosystem.
High-growth technology and direct-to-consumer companies that are successful at creating data-driven direct to consumer business models and addressing the significant consumer demand for more personalized experiences will reach significant financial scale and create shareholder value. With consumers spending more time online, brands can more easily control the entire customer journey from discovery to payment, often driving higher lifetime values. With transactions occurring online, there has been an explosion of data generated by consumers such as frequency of webpage visits, transaction size, viewed and saved items, checkout cart items, etc. As all this new data provides an opportunity for better targeting and marketing, many private companies have been raising significant private capital to deploy via marketing with the hopes of supercharging growth. However, many companies lack the marketing sophistication required to build a sustainable competitive moat with positive long-term unit economics. As our management team has seen, the best companies in these categories are able to efficiently acquire new customers and deliver a personalized experience which increases engagement and drives higher long-term retention.

​

Key sub-sectors within the technology ecosystem that we believe are poised to experience rapid growth and could benefit from the experiences of our management team include, but are not limited to, telemedicine, food technology, education technology, healthcare technology, cybersecurity, e-commerce, enterprise software, financial technology, space technology, robotics and automation technology, artificial intelligence, among others. The success or failure of companies that operate in these markets is largely driven by their ability to continuously innovate and scale technology-driven solutions and products.
Tremendous market value has been created by these types of businesses over the last decade as entrepreneurs and investors have raced to build the next-generation of technology and direct-to-consumer internet brands. Despite the significant growth of the sector, many companies remain private with no clear timetable to become public. We believe there exists a set of companies that with the right guidance and leadership could and should be public companies. Within our target universe there have been over 1,400 companies that raised $50 million or more from 2015 to January 2021, representing approximately $313 billion of private capital raised in aggregate. In the same time period only approximately 130 companies in our target universe went public raising approximately $75 billion in aggregate capital (Source: Pitchbook, Thompson One and Capital IQ). This significant imbalance in the number of private companies and capital raised versus public companies is emblematic of a broken initial public offering market. With so much capital tied up in illiquid private markets, we believe there will be significant interest from founders and investors in these categories to engage with our team to achieve a public listing.
COVID-19 has proven to be a catalyst for growth for our potential target universe, pulling forward digital consumer trends and adoption across several consumer categories. There are a number of businesses who have seen massive growth due in part to COVID-19 and they will need capital to effectively address the increased demand for their products and services. We will likely represent an attractive option to many of these companies as an efficient and strategic way to raise capital and reach the public markets quickly.
Our management team has extensive experience building, advising and investing in companies operating in the same ecosystem as many of the companies in our target categories. We will leverage our embedded relationships and network of peers in the space to quickly engage with founders in our target universe. Our unique set of experiences building omni-channel business models and operations will be viewed as a strategic asset to founders in our target categories. For example, in February 2020 our Chairman, Mr. Krim, successfully led the public debut of an omni-channel digital first brand, Casper Sleep putting him in a unique position to advise other founders in the category looking to reach the public markets.
Additionally, our management team has an extensive track record of building data-driven marketing organizations, which has resulted in significant growth in both revenue and shareholder value. Our experience building sustaining consumer internet brands and leading marketing teams uniquely positions us to help companies in the category achieve their long-term vision and outperform the competition.
We aim to leverage our extensive expertise driving marketing innovation and revenue growth within leading public technology companies to help founders achieve long-term success and overcome any deterrents to becoming a public company. By leveraging our extensive operational experience and network, we believe we can provide significant benefits to potential targets and public market investors that can potentially lead to attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns in the public markets.
We believe there are significant opportunities in these industries to drive value creation, and the below themes will be general areas of focus:

● | Traditional late-stage growth equity targets looking for a liquidity event and valuable operating and marketing expertise;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Business combinations (e.g., two competitors in similar segments) to achieve synergies from enhanced scale, liquidity and increased marketing efficiency;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Verticalization of the target company through acquisitions (e.g., within downstream infrastructure and supply chain) to improve margins and IP defensibility;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Global consolidation (e.g., two companies in similar segments but different geographies) to achieve synergies from enhanced scale, liquidity and increased marketing efficiency;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​


● | Special situations (e.g., spin outs, divestitures) with strong brands that have potential for operational improvement and future growth;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rapidly growing companies with opportunity to change large categories.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Value Proposition and Differentiation
Tailwind’s management team brings a unique set of operational skills and transaction experience that will be highly relevant for today’s entrepreneur. In addition, our management team’s capital markets, M&A and capital raising experience will be invaluable to a potential target as they look to ready themselves for a public debut.

● | Extensive Operating Experience With Rare Skillsets: Our management team has extensive experience serving in leadership positions for high-growth public and private companies. The team boasts significant operational experience driving growth through innovative marketing techniques with Mr. Krim introducing innovative quantitative marketing approaches at Casper Sleep with key areas of expertise including: (i) identifying superior brands and products using (a) data science to optimize audiences, (b) optimization of media mix of advertising (often purchased programmatically through real-time auctions), and (c) driving the ‘lifetime value’ of customers (via behavioral signals to drive promotions and engagement); and (ii) capturing and architecting the right customer data elements, using predictive modeling to drive propensity models that understand a customer’s wants and needs, and putting in place optimal marketing technologies to deploy experiences in real time. This expertise will be highly valuable for identifying categories and companies with under-optimized marketing practices and rapidly scaling customer acquisition and lifetime value, as well as for potential targets to understand their own customers and acquiring them efficiently to unlock growth.

● | Significant Public Equity Capital Markets Experience: Our management team’s “best-practice” know-how will contribute to the target company’s success as a public company by providing guidance around (i) investor relations (ii) equity research (iii) introductions to long-only funds, among others. Mr. Krim successfully took Casper Sleep public in February 2020. More recently, Mr. Krim led the IPO of Tailwind Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: TWND), a special purpose acquisition company, raising $334.2 million in aggregate capital in September 2020. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Attractive Industry Dynamics For SPAC Success: In the current environment, there is growing investor demand for companies with (i) a direct relationship with their customers, (ii) ability to efficiently market to and grow their customer base and (iii) high-growth and clear path to profitability. Our target verticals are ripe for consolidation with few large-cap companies and thousands of sub-scale companies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Founder Friendly Platform For Growth: The team will bring to bear operational expertise and capital to accelerate the targets organic growth initiatives such as (i) optimization of marketing strategies (ii) operational improvements and (iii) new product development, among others. Our management team has the experience and track record to successfully integrate add-on acquisitions, bringing PE Sponsor-like support, without running / controlling the business.

Business Combination Criteria and Sourcing Process
We intend to leverage what we believe is a competitive advantage in sourcing potential targets that will materially benefit from our unique expertise and where we are best situated to augment the value of the business following the completion of the initial business combination.

8



​

We believe our management team is well positioned to identify unique opportunities across the technology private company landscape. Our selection process will leverage our relationships with leading technology company founders, executives of private and public companies, venture capitalists and growth equity funds, in addition to the extensive industry and geographical reach of our management team, which we believe should provide us with a key competitive advantage in sourcing potential business combination targets.
We also believe that our management team’s reputation, experience and track record of making investments in the technology industry will make us a preferred partner for these potential targets. Given our profile and thematic approach, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, in particular founders of, and investors in, other private and public technology companies in our networks.
We intend to focus our target sourcing efforts on assessing companies that we believe would benefit significantly from being publicly traded. Further, we believe that we are providing an interesting alternative investment opportunity that capitalizes on key trends impacting the capital markets for technology companies.
Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We expect to conduct a comprehensive due diligence review which will include, among other things, management and employee meetings, review of financial information, facility inspection, and an extensive review of all other material target company information. We intend to use these criteria as guidelines in evaluating potential acquisition opportunities, but an acquisition may be executed even if it does not meet our guidelines.
Acquisition Criteria
We have developed the following, non-exclusive criteria that we use to screen for and evaluate potential initial business combinations.

● | Size: We target entities whose enterprise value is in excess of $1 billion, with a focus on founder-led, late stage growth equity opportunities in the high-growth technology and direct-to-consumer ecosystems with defensible market positions. We believe these companies offer long term risk-adjusted return potential.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Founder-Led Businesses Where We Have Strong Relationships: Strong, experienced management team that could benefit from our extensive networks and insights with a track record of driving growth and profitability. Founders that have a long-term vision for the future of their business and want to build a lasting company. Companies where we have a unique relationship and can engage directly with the founder(s), potentially without participating in an auction.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Large Addressable Markets Being Disrupted by Technology: We identify high quality businesses run by exceptional teams pursuing large market opportunities. Target companies positioned in industries that are ripe for disruption and technological advancements. Sectors at an inflection point, where technology and disruptors will be uniquely advantaged to capture market share and future growth. Scalable platform in a market ripe for horizontal and / or vertical consolidation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Growth And Attractive Margin Profile: Consistent organic revenue growth with scalable unit economics. Potential for future top line and margin expansion. Ability to generate attractive returns on capital and has a compelling use for capital to achieve their growth strategy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunities Where Our Team Can Add Value: Sectors where management can benefit from our extensive networks and insights. Taking advantage of our connections in both the public and private markets in order to generate firm value and future growth. Leverage industry experience, financial acumen and network of management team to identify additional operational and marketing improvement opportunities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target 

9



​

business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.
Our Acquisition Process
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Members of our management team directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants following our initial public offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including Tailwind Acquisition Corp., pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duties. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to such officer’s and director’s fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. In addition, affiliates of our sponsor currently sponsor other blank check companies:

● | Tailwind Acquisition Corp., where Mr. Krim serves as Chairman of the board of directors, Mr. Hollod and Mr. Eby serve as directors and executive officers, and Ms. Lu serves as director; therefore, Tailwind Acquisition Corp. may present an additional conflict of interest in pursuing an acquisition target; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tailwind International Acquisition Corp., where Mr. Krim serves as Chairman of the board of directors, Mr. Hollod and Mr. Eby serve as directors and executive officers and Tommy Stadlen serves as director;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.
Initial Business Combination
So long as our securities are then listed on the NYSE, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair 

10



​

market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. If our securities are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net asset test.
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
Financial Position
As of December 31, 2021, we had $345,089,823 held in the trust account, before payment of $12,075,000 of deferred underwriting fees. We offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholder upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a 

11



​

public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
Limitations on Redemptions
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with the NYSE rules.
If we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, our sponsor and each member of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares and public shares in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 12,937,500, or 37.5%, or 2,156,250, or 6.25%, of the 34,500,000 public shares sold in our initial public 

12



​

offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition, our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Shareholder Approval
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.

​

Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian (“DWAC”) System, at the holder’s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed that we will have only 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering to consummate an initial business combination. If we have not consummated an initial business combination within such 24 month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate 

14



​

amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within the 24 month period.
Our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. However, if our initial shareholders acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame).
Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $1,552,520 held outside the trust account as of December 31, 2021, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are 

15



​

believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Jefferies LLC (the “underwriter”) will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $4,200,000 following our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $1,500,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $1,500,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.
If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to

claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.

We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (As Revised ) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, or the Exchange Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements, and, if their revenues are less than $100 million, not providing an independent registered public accounting firm attestation on internal control over financial reporting. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
Legal Proceedings
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.
