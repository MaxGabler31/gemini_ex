Item 1.Business
Overview
Sun Country Airlines is a new breed of hybrid low-cost air carrier that dynamically deploys shared resources across our synergistic scheduled service, charter, and cargo businesses. By doing so, we believe we are able to generate high growth, high margins and strong cash flows with greater resilience than other passenger airlines. We focus on serving leisure and VFR passengers and charter customers and providing CMI service to Amazon, with flights throughout the United States and to destinations in Canada, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Based in Minnesota, we operate an agile network that includes our scheduled service business and our synergistic charter and cargo businesses. We share resources, such as flight crews, across our scheduled service, charter and cargo business lines with the objective of generating higher returns and margins and mitigating the seasonality of our route network. We optimize capacity allocation by market, time of year, day of week and line of business by shifting flying to markets during periods of peak demand and away from markets during periods of low demand with far greater frequency than nearly all other large U.S. passenger airlines. We believe our flexible business model generates higher returns and margins while also providing greater resiliency to economic and industry downturns than a traditional scheduled service carrier.
Our Unique Business Model
Scheduled Service. Our scheduled service business combines low costs with a high quality product to generate higher TRASM than ULCCs while maintaining lower Adjusted CASM than LCCs, resulting in best-in-class unit profitability. Our scheduled service business includes many cost characteristics of ultra low-cost carriers, or ULCCs (which include Allegiant Travel Company, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines), such as an unbundled product (which means we offer a base fare and allow customers to purchase ancillary products and services for an additional fee), and point-to-point service. We fly a single-family fleet of Boeing 737-NG aircraft, which allows us to maintain a cost base comparable to these ULCCs. However, we offer a high quality product that we believe is superior to ULCCs and consistent with that of low-cost carriers, or LCCs (which include Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways). Our product includes generous legroom, complimentary beverages, in-flight entertainment, and in-seat power. The combination of our agile peak demand network with our elevated consumer product allows us to generate higher TRASM than ULCCs while maintaining lower Adjusted CASM than LCCs. In addition, as a low cost, leisure focused carrier, rather than a business travel focused carrier, we believe we are one of the early beneficiaries of the industry rebound following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Charter. Our charter business, which is one of the largest narrow body charter operations in the United States, is a key component of our strategy both because it provides inherent diversification and downside demand protection (it is uncorrelated to our scheduled service, as evidenced by the fact that it recovered faster than our scheduled service business during the COVID-19 pandemic) as well as because it is synergistic with our other businesses (for example, we can dynamically deploy aircraft and pilots to their most profitable uses whether they are in charter or scheduled service). Our charter business has several favorable characteristics, including large repeat customers, more stable demand than scheduled service flying and the ability to pass through certain costs, including fuel. Our diverse charter customer base includes casino operators, the U.S. Department of Defense, college sports teams and professional sports teams. In October 2021, we signed a five-year agreement to provide charter service to all Major League Soccer (MLS) teams. Major League Soccer features 28 clubs throughout the United States and Canada, in addition to a future expansion team in St. Louis, MO. We are the leading charter airline for college sports including the National Collegiate Athletic Association (“NCAA”) Championships (notably “March Madness”) as well as individual team travel. Additionally, we signed a new five-year agreement, effective March 2022 to provide charter service to Caesars Entertainment, Inc. This agreement restarts a relationship between the two organizations that ended in late 2020. The agreement calls for two aircraft to provide charter service for Caesars Entertainment guests to Atlantic City, New Jersey, Reno, Nevada, Laughlin, Nevada and Gulfport, Mississippi. Our charter business includes ad hoc, repeat, short-term and long-term service contracts with pass-through fuel arrangements and annual rate escalations. Most of our business is non-cyclical because the U.S. Department of Defense and sports teams still fly during normal economic downturns, and our casino contracts are long-term in nature.
Our charter business has proven to be more resilient than our scheduled service business during the COVID-19 induced downturn. Additionally, our charter business complements our seasonal and day-of-week focused scheduled passenger service by allowing us to optimally schedule our aircraft and crews to the most profitable flying opportunities. In general, charter ASMs are highest in fall months when scheduled service operations are less favorable. In addition, certain costs may be passed directly to the customer. Fuel expense is typically incurred by us; however, revenue rates under our charter contracts are often adjusted for final fuel prices incurred, effectively shifting fuel price risk away from us.
Cargo. On December 13, 2019, we signed the ATSA with Amazon to provide air cargo services. Flying under the ATSA began in May 2020 and, as of December 31, 2021, we are flying 12 Boeing 737-800 cargo aircraft for Amazon (having been awarded two additional aircraft in October and November 2020 after the initial contract for 10 aircraft). Our CMI service is asset-light from a Sun Country perspective, as Amazon supplies the aircraft and covers many of the operating expenses, including fuel, and provides all cargo loading and unloading services. We are responsible for flying the aircraft under our air carrier certificate, crew, aircraft line maintenance and insurance, all of which allow us to leverage our existing operational expertise from our scheduled service and charter businesses. The ATSA has generated consistent, positive cash flows through the COVID-19 induced downturn. The ATSA offers potential future growth opportunities by establishing a long-term partnership with Amazon. Our cargo business also enables us to leverage certain assets, capabilities and fixed costs to enhance profitability and promote growth across our company. For example, we believe that by deploying pilots across each of our business lines, we increase the efficiency of our operations.
The ATSA is a six-year contract and includes two, two-year extensions exercisable at Amazon’s option, providing for a total term of ten years if both extension options are exercised. The option to renew the ATSA for two additional two-year terms is at Amazon’s sole discretion, subject to Amazon providing Sun Country with at least 180 days’ prior written notice before the expiration of the then-current term. The ATSA has annual rate escalations, so rate increases occurred on December 13, 2021 and 2020.
Our Transformation
In April 2018, Sun Country Airlines was acquired by the Apollo Funds. Since the acquisition, our business has been transformed under a new management team of seasoned professionals who have a strong combination of low-cost and legacy network airline experience.

● | We redesigned our network to focus on flying leisure customers during peak demand opportunities by concentrating scheduled service trips during the highest yielding months of the year and days of the week and allocating aircraft to our charter service when it is more profitable to do so.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We invested in capital projects that included modernizing the cabin experience with new seats, in-seat power and in-flight entertainment. Our investments also facilitated a transition to owning our fleet, rather than leasing, to reduce costs. We implemented a new booking engine, Navitaire, rebranded our product along with our website and invested in improving the customer support experience. We consolidated our corporate headquarters into an on-airport hangar in 2019.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We greatly expanded our ancillary products and services, which consist of baggage fees, seat assignment fees and other fees.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We launched and grew our asset light cargo business and fully integrated our pilot labor group across our scheduled service, charter, and cargo businesses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We reduced unit costs with several initiatives, including: renegotiating certain key contracts and agreements; increasing the portion of bookings made directly through our website; reducing the cost of our fleet through more efficient aircraft sourcing and financing; staffing efficiencies; and other cost-saving initiatives.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the COVID-19 induced industry downturn impeded our growth in 2020 and 2021, we believe that these investments have positioned us to profitably grow our business in the long term.
Initial Public Offering
On March 19, 2021, we completed our initial public offering, in which we issued and sold 10,454,545 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $24.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $225,329 from sales of shares in the initial public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and other offering expenses. We used $46,260 of the net proceeds from the initial public offering to repay all amounts outstanding under the CARES Act Loan. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including to acquire additional aircraft.
COVID-19 Induced Downturn
All major U.S. passenger airlines were negatively impacted by the declining demand environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also experienced a significant decline in demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused a material decline in our revenues and negatively impacted our financial condition and operating results, which is likely to continue for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our business operations were adjusted in response to the pandemic as described below. However, we believe that our diversified and flexible business model allowed us to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business in 2020 and 2021 better than any other mainline U.S. passenger airline (which we consider to be the 11 largest U.S. mainline passenger carriers based on ASMs) based on adjusted pre-tax and adjusted operating income margins. We believe this result was due to our flexible business model, allowing us to shift resources to our charter and cargo businesses and away from our scheduled service business during periods of low leisure passenger demand. Other airlines have different business models than ours, and a comparison of pre-tax and operating income margins among airlines during normal industry conditions may have a different result.

14



Actions we took during 2020 to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 induced downturn preserved more than $152,074 in liquidity and included: capacity reductions; a company-wide hiring freeze; headcount reductions; voluntary leave programs; reduced advertising expenditures; reduced capital expenditures; and deferred vendor payments. In February 2021, we executed a five-year credit agreement with a group of lenders that provides for a $25,000 Revolving Credit Facility and a $90,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility (collectively, the “Credit Facilities”). Further, we have received grants from Treasury through the Payroll Support Program and accepted the CARES Act Loan from the Treasury through the CARES Act Loan Program, which was repaid in full on March 24, 2021, without issuing any warrants, unlike nearly all other carriers with whom we compete that received government assistance. We have also maintained our pre-COVID-19 corporate credit ratings throughout this downturn. COVID-19 vaccines have become widely available in the United States and a majority of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated according to the CDC. As vaccines became more widely distributed in 2021, the airline industry continued to rebound in 2021 and we believe will normalize in 2022. Given our focus on low-cost domestic leisure travel, we believe we are rebounding faster than most other U.S. airlines.
Our financial and operating results and business operations for our scheduled service and charter businesses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 were materially and adversely impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which impact is likely to continue during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our financial and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 are more useful indicators of our scheduled service and charter service operating performance during normal industry conditions. See “Risk Factors.”
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following key strengths allow us to compete successfully within the U.S. airline industry.
Diversified and Resilient Business Model. Our diversified business model, which includes a focus on leisure and VFR passengers, charter and e-commerce related cargo service, is unique in the airline sector and mitigates the impact of economic and industry downturns on our business when compared with other large U.S. passenger airlines. Our charter business has rebounded quicker than our scheduled service business as customers such as the DoD and large university sports teams continued to fly in 2020 and 2021, while our casino customers are subject to long-term contracts and began flying again in June 2020. Our cargo business exhibited steady growth in 2020 and 2021 as flying ramped up and demand remained strong, driven by underlying secular growth in e-commerce.

15



Agile Peak Demand Scheduling Strategy. We flex our capacity by day of the week, month of the year and line of business to capture what we believe are the most profitable flying opportunities available from both our MSP home market and our network of non-MSP markets. As a result, our route network varies widely throughout the year. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the most recent normalized full year before the COVID-19 pandemic, we flew approximately 38% of our ASMs during our top 100 peak demand days of the year as compared to 15% of our ASMs during our bottom 100 demand days of the year. For 2019, our average fare was approximately 29% higher on our top 100 peak demand days as compared to the remaining days of the year. In 2019, only 3% of our routes were daily year-round, compared to 67% for Southwest Airlines, 42% for Spirit Airlines, 8% for Frontier Airlines and 2% for Allegiant Travel Company. Our agile peak demand strategy allows us to generate higher TRASM by focusing on days with stronger demand. Our flexible network has also benefitted us in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 induced industry downturn where we have been able to quickly shift capacity from low demand markets to high demand markets within the United States as COVID-19 infection rates shifted across regions of the country. Our flying continued to be more seasonal in 2021 with our scheduled service from July 2021 through April 2022 containing only 1% daily year-round routes. The following charts demonstrate that our schedule is highly variable by day of the week and month of the year.

​
In addition to shifting aircraft across our network by season and day of week, we also shift aircraft between our scheduled service and charter businesses to maximize the return on our assets. We regularly schedule our fleet using what we refer to as “Power Patterns,” which involves scheduling aircraft and crew on trips that combine scheduled service and charter legs, dynamically replacing what would be lower margin scheduled service flights with charter opportunities. Our agility is supported by our variable cost structure and the cross utilization of our people and assets between our lines of business. Our synergies from cross utilization have increased since we began providing CMI services because our pilots are interchangeably deployed between scheduled service, charter and cargo flights. For example, when demand in our scheduled service business declined in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 induced industry downturn, we allocated more pilot flying hours to our charter and cargo businesses.

16



Tactical Mid-Life Fleet with Flexible Operations. We maintain low aircraft ownership costs by acquiring mid-life Boeing 737-800 aircraft, which have lower acquisition costs when compared to new Boeing 737 aircraft, that more than offsets their higher ongoing maintenance and repair costs. Lower ownership costs allow us to maintain lower unit costs at lower levels of utilization. This allows us to concentrate our flying during periods of peak demand, which generates higher TRASM and also allows us to park aircraft during periods of low demand, at a lower cost than other airlines. In 2019, we flew our aircraft an average of 9.6 hours per day, which is the lowest among major U.S. airlines, other than Allegiant Travel Company, which operates a similar low utilization model but serves smaller markets. In addition to the benefits of lower all-in ownership costs, we do not have an aircraft order book because we only purchase mid-life aircraft. As a result, unlike many other airlines, we are not locked into large future capital expenditures. Rather, we have the ability to opportunistically take advantage of aircraft prices with purchases at the time of our choosing. Our single family aircraft fleet also has operational and cost advantages, such as allowing for optimization of crew scheduling and training and lower maintenance costs. Our fleet is highly reliable, and we have a demonstrated ability to maintain our high completion factor during harsh weather conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had a completion factor of 99.8% across our system. We improved this already leading completion factor to 99.9% in both 2020 and 2021.
Superior Low-Cost Product and Brand. We have invested in numerous projects to create a well-regarded product and brand that we believe is superior to ULCCs while maintaining lower fares than LCCs and larger full service carriers. Some of the reasons that we believe we have a superior brand to ULCCs include:

● | Our Cabin Experience. All of our 737-800 aircraft have new state-of-the-art seats that comfortably recline and have full size tray tables. Our seats have an average pitch of approximately 31 inches, giving our customers comparable legroom to Southwest Airlines and greater legroom than all ULCCs in the United States. We also provide seat-back power, complimentary in-flight entertainment and free beverages to improve the overall flying experience for our customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our Digital Experience. We have significantly improved the buying experience for our customers. We overhauled our passenger service system in 2019 and transitioned to Navitaire, the premier passenger service system in the United States. Navitaire has decreased our overall website session length, decreased the percentage of failures to complete a transaction after accessing our website on a mobile device and increased the percentage of visits to our website that result in an airfare purchase. The transition to Navitaire has been one of the most important initiatives in improving the Sun Country customer experience, making our website booking for flights more seamless, allowing us to create a large customer database and supporting ancillary revenue growth. Beyond Navitaire, we have improved the check-in experience for customers by providing access to web-check in across the system and access to kiosks in our main hub location of MSP. In 2021, 78% of our Minneapolis originating scheduled service passengers have checked in either online or at a kiosk compared to 73% in 2020. System wide over 77% of our scheduled service passengers in 2021 have checked in electronically compared to 68% in 2020. These tools increase the chances that the passenger can skip the check-in counter, which we believe improves our customers’ experience while also reducing costs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Low Cost Structure. Our CASM declined from 10.09 cents for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 8.82 cents for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Adjusted CASM declined from 7.80 cents for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 6.31 cents for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our completed and ongoing cost savings efforts include conversion to a focus on owning (versus leasing) aircraft, renegotiation of our component maintenance agreement, fuel savings initiatives, catering cost reductions, renegotiation of distribution contracts, consolidation of staff at headquarters on airport property and various other initiatives. Our CASM and Adjusted CASM for the year ended December 31, 2020 of 8.91 cents and 7.57 cents and for the year ended December 31, 2021 of 8.86 cents and 6.44 cents, respectively, were adversely impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While Adjusted CASM for all U.S. airlines increased in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 induced downturn, we believe that our business model and strategy positions us well to maintain and improve our Adjusted CASM in the future, while maintaining lower utilization rates than many other U.S. passenger airlines.

17



Strong Position in Our Profitable MSP Home Market. We have been based in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area since our founding over 35 years ago, where our brand is well-known and well-liked. We are the largest low-cost carrier operating at MSP, which is our largest base, and the second largest airline at MSP after Delta Air Lines. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic we have been focused on developing our network at MSP and have grown our nonstop destinations from MSP by over 40% since 2019. Moreover, we have seen our share of MSP-origin customers improving through the COVID pandemic. We fly out of Terminal 2, which we believe is preferred by many flyers because of its smaller layout, shorter security wait times, close parking relative to check-in and full suite of retail shops. As of December 31, 2021, we utilized 8 of the 14 gates in Terminal 2. As a result of our focus on flying during seasonal peak periods, our well regarded brand and product and our strong position in Minneapolis, we have historically enjoyed a TRASM premium to other leisure airlines at MSP.
Seasoned Management Team. Our Chief Executive Officer, Jude Bricker, joined Sun Country Airlines in July 2017 and has over 17 years of experience in the aviation industry, including serving as the Chief Operating Officer of Allegiant Travel Company from 2016 to 2017. Our President and Chief Financial Officer, Dave Davis, joined Sun Country in April 2018 and has over 23 years of experience in the aviation industry, including previously serving as the Chief Financial Officer at Northwest Airlines and US Airways. Other members of our management team have worked at airlines such as Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, United Airlines and US Airways.
Our Growth Strategy
Since 2018, we have established the infrastructure to support our significant long-term profitable growth strategy.

● | Network. We launched 64 new markets from 2018 through 2019 and developed a repeatable network growth strategy. During 2021, we announced 34 new markets. Our network strategy is expected to support passenger fleet growth to approximately 50 aircraft by the end of 2023.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fleet. We restructured our fleet with a focus on ownership of Boeing 737-800s, allowing us to focus on growth with low capital commitments. We believe the current dislocation in the aircraft market will enable us to access aircraft at an attractive cost relative to our peers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customer. We rebranded the airline around a leisure product with a significant ancillary revenue component which we believe allowed us to stimulate demand during the rebound from COVID-19 earlier than airlines focused on business travelers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Culture. We installed a new management team with a cost-conscious ethos, which included moving our headquarters into a hangar at MSP.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Operations. We maintained high standards of operational performance, including a 99.8% completion factor for the year ended December 31, 2019. We improved this already leading completion factor to 99.9% in both 2020 and 2021.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe our initiatives have provided us with a platform to profitably grow our business. Key elements of our growth strategy include:
Leverage the Expected Rebound in Our Passenger Business. The number of domestic LCC and ULCC passenger enplanements grew at a compound annual growth rate of 7% from 2014 to 2019 due to long-term increasing demand for air travel in the United States. Following the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, passenger levels declined. Our scheduled service business is rebounding as the COVID-19 pandemic matures, particularly with the uptake of vaccines. We believe we are among the early beneficiaries of this rebound given our peak demand strategy and focus on leisure and VFR travelers, who are gradually returning to pre-COVID-19 levels. In previous economic downturns, leisure and VFR travelers have also been the first to return to flying at normalized levels.

18



Grow Our Cargo Business. In December 2019, we signed the ATSA with Amazon to provide air cargo transportation services flying 10 aircraft with agreed upon pricing. Since that time, Amazon requested, and we agreed to fly, two additional aircraft to bring the total number of aircraft we are flying for Amazon to 12 as of December 31, 2021. We believe we are well-positioned to continue growing our cargo business over time, while continuing to operate for Amazon and potentially new customers.
Expand our Peak Demand Flying in Minneapolis and Beyond. Following a rebound in U.S. air travel, we intend to continue growing our network profitably both from MSP and on new routes outside of MSP by focusing on seasonal markets and day-of-the-week flying during periods of peak demand. We expanded our network from 46 routes in 2017 to 98 as of the end of 2019, including expanding our routes that neither originate nor terminate in MSP from 5 routes in 2017 to 42 as of the end of 2019. At the end of 2020 and 2021, we flew 114 and 127 network routes, respectively. These 2020 and 2021 network routes included 31 and 30 routes, respectively, that neither originated nor terminated in MSP. We have identified a significant number of additional new market opportunities, both in MSP and outside of MSP, that we expect to be profitable and allow us to grow our agile, peak-demand focused scheduled service network strategy. We have a successful history of opening and closing stations quickly to meet seasonal demand, which we believe will benefit us in re-opening markets we closed during the COVID-19 downturn and in pursuing new market growth opportunities quickly. Our future network plans include growing our network at our hub in Minneapolis to full potential, including adding frequencies on routes we already serve and adding new routes to leverage our large, loyal customer base in the area. Our long-term strategic plans have identified growth opportunities at MSP that we believe represent significant scheduled service capacity growth opportunities.
We had also been rapidly growing outside of MSP prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to do so again once the air travel market rebounds. Our customer-friendly low fares have been well received in the upper Midwest and in large, fragmented markets elsewhere that we can profitably serve on a seasonal and/or day-of-week basis. Our upper Midwest growth is focused on cold to warm weather leisure routes from markets similar to Minneapolis, such as Madison, Wisconsin. Additionally, we have added capacity on large leisure trunk routes on a seasonal basis during periods when demand is high. Examples of such routes include Los Angeles to Honolulu and Texas to Mexican beach destinations during the summer months. Our business model is ideally suited to seasonally serve these routes, which are highly profitable in normal environments because fares are elevated during the months in which we fly them. Our long-term strategic plans have identified non-MSP growth opportunities that we believe represent approximately 60% of our scheduled service capacity growth opportunities.
Continue to Increase Our Margins and Free Cash Flow. From December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019, we reduced our CASM from 10.09 cents to 8.82 cents and our Adjusted CASM from 7.80 cents to 6.31 cents, a level comparable to ULCCs. For 2020, our CASM was 8.91 cents, compared to 8.86 cents in 2021 and Adjusted CASM was 7.57 cents for 2020 and 6.44 cents for 2021, respectively. When combined with our TRASM, which remains comparable to LCCs and higher than ULCCs, we generate highly competitive margins. Our period of investment in fleet renewal and transformative capital expenditures is largely behind us, and our focus has been on growth. We intend to continue to improve our leading margin and free cash flow profile through a variety of initiatives and measures. Key initiatives include further conversion to an owned (versus leased) model for aircraft ownership, leveraging our fixed cost base as we continue to grow our passenger aircraft fleet to achieve economies of scale, continuous optimization of our maintenance operations and completion of other ongoing strategic initiatives. As a result, we expect improvements in profit margins and free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow minus non-aircraft capital expenditures, following a rebound in the U.S. air travel market to support growth in the years ahead.

Our Scheduled Service Business
We provide low-fare passenger airline service primarily to leisure and VFR travelers. Our low fares are designed to stimulate demand from price-sensitive travelers seeking a superior product to ULCCs. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our number of scheduled service passengers were approximately 2.7 million, 1.7 million and 3.6 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our average base fare was approximately $102.21, $114.96 and $111.08, respectively. Passengers and fares were both impacted dramatically by the COVID-19 pandemic in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We believe that the year ended December 31, 2019 is a more useful indicator of our average base fare and passenger statistics during normal industry conditions.
In addition to base fares, passengers can choose from a number of ancillary products for an additional cost. Sources of our ancillary revenue include baggage fees, seat selection fees, priority check-in and boarding fees, itinerary service fees, on-board sales and sales of trip insurance. Part of our strategy has been to reduce base fares to stimulate demand while increasing ancillary revenue per passenger, which we believe offers passengers more choice and correspondingly, more ancillary revenue. Our on-board sales are also designed to enhance the customer experience, including local passenger favorite brands of beer, wine and spirits. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our average ancillary revenue per passenger was approximately $42.89, $40.53, and $33.14, respectively. Overall ancillary revenues in 2021 and 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove a decline in the number of passengers, and during which we ceased on-board sales, among other actions to reduce the spread of the virus.
We also earn revenue from our Sun Country Vacations products, including commissions from the sale of third-party hotel rooms and rental cars. Our SCV products facilitate booking a flight and land package at a discounted price for our customers. We offer vacation products to promote “one stop shopping.” In 2019, our bookings for SCV were temporarily reduced in connection with a delay in the functionality for these services during the transition to our new booking system. Our other revenue also includes revenue from the transportation of mail and our co-branded credit card. During 2020, revenue from these other items decreased substantially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we saw some recovery in 2021. Despite this, we continued to enhance functionality in our booking system and we believe that we are well-positioned to capture SCV and other revenue opportunities when the COVID-19 pandemic recedes.
We also offer interline connectivity with international and domestic airlines. In mid-2019, prior to our transition to Navitaire, we offered interline connectivity with seven carriers. We have reestablished interline connectivity in our Navitaire booking system and have identified additional opportunities to grow our interline connectivity.
Route Network
Our network strategy is optimized between four key segments: MSP, non-MSP, charter services and cargo services. As Minnesota’s hometown airline, a substantial portion of our business is serving markets originating or ending in MSP. Our MSP network served approximately 52 markets in 2019. In 2020 and 2021, we served 83 and 97 markets from MSP, respectively, in spite of the COVID-19 downturn. We believe that our TRASM in our MSP network for the year ended December 31, 2019 was higher than any ULCC in its hub. We have a leading position at Terminal 2 in MSP, which is preferred by many flyers because of its smaller layout, shorter security wait times, close parking relative to check-in and full suite of retail shops. We are the largest low-cost airline at MSP, with significant opportunity to continue to grow both seat share and destinations.

20



Non-MSP service is an increasingly significant portion of our business, having grown from eight non-MSP markets in 2017 to 30 in 2021. During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-MSP growth plans were slowed. We expect to continue to identify large demand markets where other airlines have been unable to respond to market needs during periods of seasonal demand. We have a successful history of opening and closing stations to meet seasonal demand. Since the start of 2019, we have launched 83 new markets, 31 of which we have subsequently closed. As part of the on-going assessment of market opportunities, we continue to identify future growth opportunities, primarily from Midwest locations to warm weather leisure destinations and large markets with fragmented and seasonal demand peaks.
Landline offers convenient airport shuttle service for Sun Country passengers to the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport from five locations throughout Minnesota and two locations in Wisconsin.

Our charter business is a core and integral piece of our network strategy that leverages our highly flexible operating certificate and flexible labor force to serve markets worldwide. In the future, we expect to continue to grow our charter service capacity. Our charter and scheduled service businesses complement each other as our integrated scheduling allows the most profitable use of the aircraft, either scheduled or charter, to be selected on a segment by segment basis. Aircraft and crew utilization can be maximized by filling in charter flying in periods when scheduled service flying is less profitable.

22



Our air carrier operating certificate, labor agreements and operating capabilities allow us to fly to numerous destinations worldwide, which we believe is a benefit to our charter service. We have identified several growth opportunities across potential sports teams and leagues, third party charter brokers, VIP individuals, government, and leisure contracts. For example, we started regularly scheduled VIP charter service between LAX and KOA (Hawaii) with an all first-class configuration. Additionally, we have longstanding relationships with our charter customers who continue to rely on us as their trusted charter provider.
Our cargo service performed under the ATSA serves destinations on Amazon’s network. To the extent we can optimize flight crew on freighters with overlapping scheduled or charter service, we attempt to capture those synergies as well, though they are not core to that line of business. However, like the charter and scheduled service business, aircraft and crew utilization can be maximized by filling in cargo service in periods when scheduled service flying is less profitable.
Competition
The airline industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the airline industry are ticket prices, flight schedules, aircraft type, passenger amenities, customer service, reputation and frequent flyer programs. We have different competitive sets in our scheduled service business, charter business and cargo business.
Our competitors and potential competitors in the scheduled service business include both legacy network airlines and low-cost airlines. Our key competitors on domestic routes include Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Travel Company, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines and United Airlines. Our charter business competitors include charter-only operators Swift/iAero Airways, as well as other scheduled passenger carriers who also operate charter flying, such as Delta Air Lines.
The principal competitors for our cargo business include ATSG and Southern Air. Our on-time arrival performance for our cargo business since starting operations in May 2020, together with our operational capabilities, give us a stable position with our customer, Amazon.
Our principal competitive advantages are our diversified and resilient business model, our agile peak demand scheduling strategy, our tactical mid-life fleet with flexible operations, our superior low-cost product and brand, our competitive low-cost structure, our strong position in our profitable MSP home market and our seasoned management team. We also believe the association of our brand with a high level of operational performance differentiates us from our competitors and enables us to generate greater customer loyalty. Our completion factor of 99.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019, the last normalized year before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, was higher than any ULCC. We improved this already leading completion factor to 99.9% in both 2020 and 2021.
Our cost initiatives have yielded significant improvements in CASM. As a result of these improvements and our flexibility to serve seasonal and year-round markets, we believe we are better positioned to offer a schedule tailored to properly serve periods of peak demand than our peers. The majority of our competitors maintain higher utilization to keep their unit costs low, which makes it difficult for them to serve markets on a highly seasonal or day-of-week basis. As such, we believe our low Adjusted CASM coupled with relatively low utilization is a competitive advantage.
Our ability to maintain low unit costs at low utilization provides us with a competitive advantage to execute our agile peak demand network planning structure. Our peak demand strategy allows us to move into new markets quickly during periods when demand is maximized and there is less competitive pricing pressure.
See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry—The airline industry is exceedingly competitive, and we compete against LCCS, ULCCs and legacy network airlines; if we are not able to compete successfully in our markets, our business will be materially adversely affected.”

23



Seasonality
The airline industry has significant seasonal fluctuation in demand. Our network strategy is designed to take advantage of the seasonal nature of the leisure customer by concentrating our flying in seasons when demand is strongest and flying significantly less in seasons when demand is lower. As a result, our passenger business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations, especially our scheduled service. While our passenger business will remain highly seasonal, our cargo operations will have the effect of mitigating seasonal troughs. For example, when our scheduled flying demand is lower during the fall and early December, our cargo service remains consistent and grows until Christmas.
Traditionally, our business is geared towards north to south travel from MSP and the upper Midwest in the winter months, our strongest travel season. During the summer months, we focus on VFR traffic from MSP and leisure travelers originating in non-MSP markets. Although our actual results vary by season, we pride ourselves on the ability to adjust our route network and charter service to accommodate seasonality.
Distribution
We sell our scheduled service flights through direct and indirect distribution channels with the goal of selling in the most efficient way across our customer base. Our direct distribution channels include our website and our call center and our indirect distribution channels include third parties, such as travel agents and OTAs (e.g., Priceline and websites owned by Expedia, including Orbitz and Travelocity).
Our direct distribution channels are our lowest cost methods of distributing our product. In addition, they provide more opportunities to sell ancillary products and services, such as baggage services, priority check-in and boarding, and seat selections. With the introduction of our Navitaire-based reservation system and website in June 2019, we have experienced a significant increase in the proportion of our bookings that are sold through direct channels. Sales through direct channels for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were 75%, 71% and 62%, respectively.
Indirect distribution channels remain important outlets to sell our flights. Our movement in and out of markets where we may not have an established brand presence, is facilitated by the availability of our inventory through GDS companies (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport). We also generate sales through OTAs, which also broadens our ability to sell in highly seasonal markets. Sales through these relatively higher cost indirect channels for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were 25%, 29% and 38%, respectively.
We sell our charter services through an internal, dedicated sales team that is focused on long-term relationships with key customers, brokers, organizations, and college and professional sports teams. While our CMI service is presently dedicated to Amazon and governed by the ATSA, we may expand our cargo business by marketing to new potential customers.
Marketing
We are focused on direct-to-consumer marketing targeted at our core leisure and VFR travelers who pay for their own travel costs. Our marketing message is designed to convey our affordable and convenient flight options to leisure destinations. We often include our low base fares in marketing materials in order to stimulate demand.
Our marketing tools are our proprietary email distribution list consisting of over one million email addresses, our Sun Country Rewards program, as well as advertisements online, on television, radio, digital billboards and other channels. Our objective is to use our low prices, quality customer service, and differentiated in-flight product to stimulate demand and drive customer loyalty.

24



We have a team of business development professionals who utilize business-to-business methods to identify opportunities and develop and maintain relationships with potential charter customers. We do not presently market our cargo business.
Loyalty Program
Our Sun Country Rewards frequent flyer program rewards and encourages scheduled service customer loyalty and we believe it is well tailored to serving the leisure passenger. Points earned are treated like currency and can be applied towards the purchase of all or a portion of our air travel tickets. This makes our program more valuable to leisure customers who travel less frequently and would have difficultly accumulating enough points to get discounted travel on other airlines. The Sun Country Airlines Visa Signature Card is the primary vehicle whereby customers earn points and our frequent flyer program is geared specifically towards supporting adoption and continued use of the credit card. Sun Country Rewards offers award travel on every flight without blackout dates. Points expire 36 months after the date they were earned, except those points held by Sun Country Visa cardholders do not expire so long as the holder maintains the card as active. Rewards are not available to charter or cargo customers.
Customers
We believe our customers are primarily leisure and VFR travelers who are paying for their own ticket and who make their purchase decision based largely on price. These customers respond well to demand stimulation based on low base fares. Our network is agile and is adjusted for seasonal demand shifts. In the winter months, we largely focus on taking customers to warm weather destinations in the southern United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. In the other times of the year, we focus on VFR travelers to major markets and also provide service in markets where leisure or price sensitive customer demand is strong.
We believe our product appeals to price-sensitive customers because we give them the choice to pay only for the products and services they want. Overall, our business model is designed to deliver what we believe our customers want: low fares and a high quality flight experience.
We also complement our core business with charter operations. A significant portion of our charter business consists of repeat customers with whom we have long-term relationships, including several large casinos, college and professional sports teams. We have the ability to tailor our schedule to the specific needs of our charter customers, providing reliable operations, high completion factor and reasonable pricing for these customers.
Our cargo business is dedicated to our customer, Amazon. We believe we are well-positioned to continue growing our cargo business over time with Amazon, while continuing to leverage ourselves to Amazon and potentially new customers.

25



Operational Performance
We are committed to delivering excellent operational performance, even in extreme weather conditions, which we believe supports our “peak demand,” leisure-focused business model and will strengthen customer loyalty and attract new customers. This focus also strengthens our relationship with our cargo customer, Amazon, who has incentives and disincentives for performance in the ATSA. Our operational performance is enabled by our capable and dedicated workforce in maintenance, ground, flight crew and system operations, as well as our highly capable fleet of 737-NG aircraft, which are equipped to operate in adverse weather conditions worldwide. Our primary operational metrics are completion factor and on-time arrival performance because most of our markets are operated less than daily. Our completion factor of 99.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019 was industry leading. We continued this leading completion factor into 2020 and 2021, where our completion factors were 99.9% in each year. Our on-time arrival performance was 79.9%, 80.7%, and 69.9% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These figures are inclusive of weather-driven cancelations, which our competitors often experience during extreme weather events in our home base of MSP. Our completion factor compares favorably to our competitors, with Sun Country leading among key competitor airlines as indicated below for the year ended December 31, 2019, the last normalized year before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Aircraft Fuel
Aircraft fuel is generally our largest individual expense representing approximately 25.0%, 21.7% and 26.6% of our total operating costs for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The price and 

26



availability of jet fuel are volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors as well as domestic and local supply factors. Our historical fuel consumption and costs were as follows:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
-------------------------------------+---+-------------------------+--------+------+---+--------+---+---+-------
​ | ​ | Year Ended December 31,
​ | | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019 
Fuel Gallons Consumed (in thousands) | | ​ | 60,739 | | ​ | 43,844 | | ​ | 78,042
Average Price per Gallon | ​ | $ | 2.19 | ​ | $ | 1.58 | ​ | $ | 2.26 

​
Gallons consumed includes scheduled service and charter operations, but does not include cargo. Average price per gallon includes related fuel fees and taxes but excludes fuel-hedging gains and losses.
From time to time, we may enter into fuel derivative contracts in order to mitigate the risk to our business from future volatility in fuel prices, but such contracts may not fully protect us from all related risks. The intention of our fuel hedging program is not to manage earnings, but rather to protect our liquidity. As of December 31, 2021, we had no fuel hedges in place, since the last of them matured in September 2021. Generally speaking, our charter operations and the ATSA have pass-through provisions for fuel costs, and as such we do not hedge our fuel requirements for that portion of our business. Our hedges in place at the end of 2020 consisted of collars and call options, and the underlying commodities consisted of both Gulf Coast Jet Fuel contracts as well as West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil contracts. As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding fuel derivative contracts and, at this time, we have no plans to hedge fuel going forward.
Technical Operations: Maintenance, Repairs and Overhaul
We have an FAA mandated and approved maintenance program, which is administered by an experienced group of Technical Operations leaders. All of our technicians are two-licensed Airframe and Powerplant and undergo extensive initial and recurrent training. Aircraft maintenance and repair consists of routine and non-routine maintenance, and work performed is divided into three general categories: line maintenance, heavy maintenance, and component maintenance.
Line maintenance work is handled by our employees and maintenance contractors and consists of work performed between flights or overnight. Performing effective line maintenance is critical in maintaining a reliable operation and represents the majority of and most extensive maintenance we perform. Line maintenance consists of routine daily and weekly scheduled maintenance checks and unplanned maintenance on our aircraft. We maintain Sun Country technicians in Minneapolis, with limited line maintenance capabilities in Gulfport, Mississippi, Dallas-Fort Worth/Alliance Fort Worth, Texas, Lakeland Linder Airport, Florida, and Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport, Arizona. All other line maintenance is provided by third-party maintenance contractors as needed.
Heavy maintenance consists of engine, auxiliary power units, landing gear, and airframe overhauls, which some are quite extensive and can take several months to complete. We maintain an inventory of spare engines to provide for continued operations during engine maintenance events. Airframe heavy maintenance visits consist of a series of complex tasks that generally take from one to six weeks to accomplish and are performed on a set schedule with varying repeat intervals. Due to our relatively small fleet size and projected fleet growth, we believe outsourcing all of our heavy maintenance, engine restoration and major part repair is more economical. On our cargo aircraft, heavy maintenance is a pass-through expense to our customer, Amazon.
We also outsource component maintenance. Component maintenance consists of the ongoing and routine maintenance of aircraft components that are line replaceable units. These contracts cover the majority of our aircraft component inventory acquisition, replacement and repairs, thereby reducing the need to carry extensive spare parts inventory.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had 2,181 and 1,699 employees, respectively.

27



FAA regulations require pilots to have commercial licenses with specific ratings for the aircraft to be flown and to be medically certified as physically fit to fly. FAA and medical certifications are subject to periodic renewal requirements including recurrent training and recent flying experience. Mechanics, quality-control inspectors and flight dispatchers must be certificated and qualified for specific aircraft. Flight attendants must have initial and periodic competency training and qualification. Training programs are subject to approval and monitoring by the FAA. Management personnel directly involved in the supervision of flight operations, training, maintenance and aircraft inspection must also meet experience standards prescribed by FAA regulations.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 46% of our employees were represented by labor unions under collective-bargaining agreements as set forth in the table below. Our pilots are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, our flight attendants are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and our dispatchers are represented by the Transport Workers Union. Our dispatchers approved a new contract in December 2019, which is amendable on November 14, 2024. Our collective bargaining agreement with our flight attendants became amendable on December 31, 2019. We entered into negotiations in November 2019. Negotiations were paused by mutual consent in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We restarted negotiations with our flight attendants in October of 2021 and negotiations are ongoing. Our collective bargaining agreement with our pilots was ratified on December 21, 2021 and is amendable on December 31, 2026.
As of December 31, 2021, the status of the collective-bargaining agreements for our employees was as follows:
​

Employee Group | | Number of Employees | | Representative | | Status of Agreement/Amendable Date | 
Pilots | ​ | 456 | ​ | Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) | ​ | Amendable in December 2026 | ​
Flight Attendants | ​ | 527 | ​ | International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) | ​ | Currently amendable (commenced as of December 2019) | ​
Dispatchers | ​ | 27 | ​ | Transport Workers Union (TWU) | ​ | Amendable in November 2024 | ​

​
The United States Railway Labor Act (“RLA”) governs our relations with labor organizations. Under the RLA, the collective bargaining agreements generally do not expire, but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, they must notify the other party in the manner agreed to by the parties. Under the RLA, after receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) to appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no set timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation process. It is not unusual for those processes to last for many months, and even for a few years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During that period (or after), a Presidential Emergency Board (“PEB”) may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another “cooling off” period of 30 days. At the end of a “cooling off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to “self-help,” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent “self-help” by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties.
Safety and Security
Safety is the most important thing we do and we are committed to the safety and security of our passengers and employees. In addition to complying with federally regulated safety and security standards, we strive to create a culture of safety and security that achieves the highest possible industry standard.

28



We have invested in a safety management system platform (ProSafeT), which allows for anonymous reporting of safety concerns by employees and business partners and promotes active participation in the identification, reduction and elimination of hazards. We also use ProSafeT as a central repository for tracking all Safety Assurance information, as well as Safety Risk Mitigation activities, creating awareness and transparency for the leadership teams to actively monitor the health of our Safety Management System (SMS) and Security Management System (SeMS). Our ongoing focus on safety relies on training our employees to proper standards and providing them with the tools and equipment they require so they can perform their job functions in a safe and efficient manner. Safety in the workplace targets several areas of our operation including: flight operations, maintenance, in-flight, dispatch and station operations.
We participate in ASIAS (FAA Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing System), which is a central conduit for the exchange of safety information among its stakeholders, and FOQA (Flight Operations Quality Assurance), a structured program to gather and aggregate electronically recorded flight operations data for the purpose of identifying areas where safety, efficiency and training can be improved. We invested in CEFA animation software which creates 3D flight video simulations using our data to enhance pilot training. Furthermore, we voluntarily completed the International Air Transport Association or IATA Operational Safety Audit in June 2021, which is the benchmark for global safety. We also implemented a LOSA (Line Operations Safety Audit) program to proactively monitor and diagnose our operation’s safety performance and a SeMS to protect the Company’s assets and operations. Some of the other safety and security measures we have taken include: aircraft security and surveillance, positive bag matching procedures, enhanced passenger and baggage screening and search procedures and securing of cockpit doors.
Our ongoing focus on safety relies on transparency with our regulators, training our employees to proper standards and providing them with the tools and equipment they require so they can perform their job functions in a safe and efficient manner, and learning from industry best practices through a collaborative, inter-airline safety sharing program. Safety in the workplace targets several areas of our operation, including: flight operations, maintenance, in-flight, dispatch and station operations. In addition, we recently conducted a safety culture survey, the results of which we have used to create action plans for areas of opportunity.
Insurance
We maintain insurance policies we believe are of types customary in the airline industry and as required by the DOT, lessors and other financing parties. The policies principally provide liability coverage for public and passenger injury; damage to property; loss of or damage to flight equipment; fire; auto; directors’ and officers’ liability; advertiser and media liability; cyber risk liability; fiduciary; workers’ compensation and employer’s liability; and war risk (terrorism).
Foreign Ownership
Under federal law and DOT policy, we must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens. The restrictions imposed by federal law and DOT policy currently require that at least 75% of our voting stock must be owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by persons or entities who are citizens of the United States (“U.S. citizens”), as that term is defined in 49 U.S.C. §40102(a)(15), that our president and at least two-thirds of the members of our Board of Directors and other managing officers be U.S. citizens, and that we be under the actual control of U.S. citizens. In addition, at least 51% of our total outstanding stock must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens and no more than 49% of our stock may be owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by persons or entities who are not U.S. citizens and are from countries that have entered into “open skies” air transport agreements with the United States which allow unrestricted access between the United States and the applicable foreign country and to points beyond the foreign country on flights serving the foreign country. We are currently in compliance with these ownership provisions. For a discussion of the procedures we instituted to ensure compliance with these foreign ownership rules, please see “RISK FACTORS - Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock - Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions limiting ownership and voting by non-U.S. citizens.”

29



Government Regulation
Aviation Regulation
The airline industry is heavily regulated, especially by the federal government. Two of the primary regulatory authorities overseeing air transportation in the United States are the DOT and the FAA. The DOT has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity, exemptions and other economic authority required for airlines to provide domestic and foreign air transportation. International routes and international code-sharing arrangements are regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved. A U.S. airline’s ability to operate flights to and from international destinations is subject to the air transport agreements between the United States and the foreign country and the carrier’s ability to obtain the necessary authority from the DOT and the applicable foreign government.
The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted access between the United States and the applicable foreign country and to points beyond the foreign country on flights serving the foreign country. With certain other countries, however, the United States has a restricted air transportation agreement. Our international flights to Mexico are governed by a liberalized bilateral air transport agreement which the DOT has determined has all of the attributes of an “open skies” agreement. Changes in the aviation policies of the United States, Mexico or other countries in which we operate could result in the alteration or termination of the corresponding air transport agreement, diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our operations to/from these countries.
The FAA is responsible for regulating and overseeing matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including the control of navigable air space, the qualification of flight personnel, flight training practices, compliance with FAA airline operating certificate requirements, aircraft certification and maintenance requirements and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA requires each commercial airline to obtain and hold an FAA air carrier certificate. We currently hold an FAA air carrier certificate.
Airport Access
In the United States, the FAA currently regulates the allocation of take-off and landing authority, slots, slot exemptions, operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms, which limit take-offs and landings, at certain airports. Level 1 is assigned where the capacity of airport infrastructure is generally adequate to meet the demands of airport users at all times and therefore there is no extensive pattern of delays. Level 2 is assigned where there is potential for congestion during some periods of the day, week or season, which can be resolved by schedule adjustments mutually agreed between the airlines and schedule facilitator. Level 3 is assigned where (i) demand for airport infrastructure significantly exceeds the airport’s capacity during the relevant period; (ii) expansion of airport infrastructure to meet demand is not possible in the short term; (iii) attempts to resolve the problem through voluntary schedule adjustments have failed or are ineffective; and (iv) as a result, a process of slot allocation is required whereby it is necessary for all airlines and other aircraft operators to have a slot allocated by a coordinator in order to arrive or depart at the airport during the periods when slot allocation occurs. We do not currently operate in or out of any Level 3 airports. We currently operate, or plan to operate, in and out of San Francisco International Airport (SFO), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and Newark International Airport (EWR), which are Level 2 airports.
In addition, we have arranged for service to Vancouver, Canada, with flights starting in the second quarter of 2022. Terminal access for Vancouver is controlled by Vancouver Airport Authority due to facility constraints. We have obtained the access we need to accommodate our planned service.

30



Consumer Protection Regulation
The DOT also has jurisdiction over certain economic issues affecting air transportation and consumer protection matters, including unfair or deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition, lengthy tarmac delays, airline advertising, denied boarding compensation, ticket refunds, baggage liability, contracts of carriage, customer service commitments, consumer notices and disclosures, customer complaints and transportation of passengers with disabilities. The DOT frequently adopts new consumer protection regulations, such as rules to protect passengers addressing lengthy tarmac delays, chronically delayed flights, codeshare disclosure and undisclosed display bias. They also have adopted, and do adopt, new rules on airline advertising and marketing practices. The DOT also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements, marketing agreements, code-sharing agreements (where an airline places its designator code on a flight operated by another airline) and wet-leasing agreements (where one airline provides aircraft and crew to another airline) between carriers and regulates other economic matters such as slot transactions.
Security Regulation
The TSA and the CBP, each a division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports, and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the United States. International flights are subject to customs, border, immigration and similar requirements of equivalent foreign governmental agencies. We are currently in compliance with all directives issued by such agencies.
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and affecting matters such as air emissions (including GHG emissions), noise emissions, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the use, management, release, discharge and disposal of, and exposure to, materials and chemicals.
We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that require us to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under certain laws, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of wastes directly attributable to us.

31



GHG Emissions
Concern about climate change and greenhouse gases has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in additional regulation or taxation of aircraft emissions in the United States and abroad. In particular, on March 6, 2017, the ICAO or International Civil Aviation Organization, an agency of the United Nations established to manage the administration and governance of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, adopted new carbon dioxide, or CO2 certification standards for new aircraft beginning in 2020. The new CO2 standards will apply to new aircraft type designs from 2020, and to aircraft type designs already in production as of 2023. In-production aircraft that do not meet the standard by 2028 will no longer be able to be produced unless their designs are modified to meet the new standards. In August 2016, the EPA made a final endangerment finding that GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, which obligates the EPA under the Clean Air Act to set GHG emissions standards for aircraft. On January 11, 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule regulating GHG emissions from aircraft that largely conforms to the March 2017 ICAO standards. However, President Biden, who is expected to promote more aggressive policies with respect to climate change and carbon emissions, including in the aviation sector, issued an executive order calling for a review of regulatory actions of the prior administration for their consistency with the Biden administration’s policies, including with respect to climate change. Accordingly, there may be future rulemaking that may result in stricter GHG emissions standards than those contained in the proposed rule.
In addition, in October 2016, the ICAO adopted the CORSIA, which is a global, market-based emissions offset program designed to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. The CORSIA will increase operating costs for us and other U.S. airlines that operate internationally. The CORSIA is being implemented in phases, with information sharing that began in 2019 and a pilot phase that began in 2021. Certain details are still being developed and the impact cannot be fully predicted.
Noise
Federal law recognizes the right of airport operators with special noise problems to implement local noise abatement procedures so long as those procedures do not interfere unreasonably with interstate and foreign commerce and the national air transportation system, subject to FAA review under the Airport Noise and Control Act of 1990. These restrictions can include limiting nighttime operations, directing specific aircraft operational procedures during take-off and initial climb and limiting the overall number of flights at an airport. While we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past, our operations could be adversely impacted if ICAO or locally imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.
Other Regulations
Airlines are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters. The privacy and security of passenger and employee data is regulated by various domestic and foreign laws and regulations.
