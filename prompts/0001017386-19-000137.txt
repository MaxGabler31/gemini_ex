Our management team has over 30 years of combined experience in the food and beverage industry. In July 2016, we acquired the company’s first Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”) in an all cash purchase. Since then, we have also acquired the Victoria’s Kitchen brand and The Giant Beverage Company, giving LFER bi-coastal distribution coverage. LFER has now engaged with a management advisor that is providing direct hands on, management advice, strategic planning, exploring the build out of a Digital Marketing Platform to address the explosion in Online, Social and Mobile marketing and other assistance similar to services seen in more advanced companies.
 
Corporate Overview
 
Life On Earth, Inc. (formerly Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc.) was incorporated in April 2013.
 
In October 2013, we signed a distribution agreement with Gran Nevada Beverage, Inc. (“Gran Nevada”), an entity related through common management and ownership. The agreement provides us with the right to sell and distribute Gran Nevada's beverages in the United States with purchase prices at the then applicable wholesale prices charged to Gran Nevada's distributors. The agreement is for an initial term of five years with automatic renewals of successive five year terms unless terminated. We initiated sales and distribution operations in March 2014.
 
In July, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Energy Sources Distributors, Inc. (“ESD”) from its three founding shareholders. ESD provides wholesale distribution of specialty beverage products from its headquarters in Gilroy, California. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $450,000 in cash. We retained one of the selling founders as General Manager for a term of twelve (12) months pursuant to an employment agreement to manage operations at the ESD facility in Gilroy, California. ESD is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The acquisition of ESD in July 2016 allowed LFER to expand distribution on the West Coast.
 
In October 2017, LFER acquired Victoria’s Kitchen, LLC ("VK"). On April 30th, 2018, LFER acquired The Giant Beverage Company Inc. (“Giant” or “GBC”). Giant is a Direct Store Delivery (DSD) business that covers the five boroughs of New York City under an eight route distribution system. The company services over 600 accounts in the five boroughs. Giant services mainly independent retailers but is expanding to service authorized chain accounts. The acquisitions of Giant in April 2018, VK in October 2017, and ESD in July 2016 has allowed us to expand distribution.

Sales and Distribution 
 
The Company currently markets and sells mainstream functional beverage products through its Direct Store Delivery (DSD) platforms of ESD and Giant subsidiaries as well as through other distributors including KeHe and UNFI as well as independent distributors. The Company also sells it Victoria’s Kitchen brands direct to consumers via Amazon online. Brands sought by LFER primarily engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling unique, premium, all natural nonalcoholic functional beverages that are targeted towards LFER active lifestyle consumers.
Production 
 
The Company Life On Earth, Inc. uses third party vendors to outsource and purchase raw materials as well as contract manufactures (co-packers) its products. These co-packers are independently owned and operated and function as a third party manufacturing partner in order fulfill the inventory needs of LFER’s brands. These co-packers are located in different geographic locations throughout the United States and currently the Company uses two co-packers.
Competition

LFER is functional beverage company. What sets us apart in the industry, is our consolidated corporate structure that handles all aspects of sales, marketing and proprietary distribution from a centralized location. The LFER platform is built for accelerating emerging growth brands in the United States by leveraging sales, supply chain, and distribution relationships. At LFER, we are forward-thinking. We have identified ways to build out distribution channels that are more flexible and responsive to today’s needs. Our innovations have given rise to distribution channels, which provide robust capabilities embedded in an extended enterprise.
 
We realize that by sharing resources and capabilities in novel ways with new products in new situations, we can take advantage of profit-making opportunities that individual companies could not exploit alone. Our creation of a more flexible and responsive distribution system is not only a concept; we have applied the practice through implementation with our own functional beverage brands.
 
The Consumers Packaged Goods market is highly competitive especially in the beverage category. Competitors in our market compete for brand recognition, ingredient sourcing, qualified personnel, distribution and product shelf space. As a developing company, a majority of our competitors are more established and better capitalized. The packaged beverage market is generally dominated by the largest beverage providers. Many of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition and consumer confidence and can readily secure shelf space and media attention for their products. Many of our competitors also have existing relationships with the same distribution channels and retailers through which we sell our products. We intend to compete in the market by offering consumers affordable products that taste better and possess a longer shelf life than most products in the market.

Government Regulation
 
Packaged beverage and juice products are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As such, it is necessary for the Company to ensure its products distributed establish, maintain and make available for inspection, records and labels with nutrition information that meet legal food labeling requirements. The Company’s products are manufactured by contracted production facilities that are subject to many regulations, including Food Facility Registration, recordkeeping, Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements, reporting, preventive controls and inspections.
 
The Company has not incurred research and development expenses for new product development.
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has 20 full-time employees. Certain positions are being filled with paid independent contractors or insider owners who do not receive cash compensation but may receive stock compensation. In certain regions of the United States, we utilize the services of direct sales and distribution companies, which sell our products through their distribution channels. This can mitigate the need for a large sales and merchandising force. The Company also outsources its logistics to third-parties, which can reduce the need for employees in these roles.
Going Concern Qualification
 
Several conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred net losses of $3,003,761 and $2,980,031 for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, has limited revenues and requires additional financing in order to finance its business activities on an ongoing basis. The Company’s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors including, but not limited to, continued progress in finding business opportunities. At May 31, 2018, we had cash on hand of $189,317 and an accumulated deficit of ($6,798,340). See “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 
Intellectual Property Protection
 
The Company has secured a registered trademark for its name and logo. LFER does have its trademark registered for Life On Earth Inc. As of the date of this annual report, we have the trademarks for our intellectual property.
Emerging Growth Company
 
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Stamps Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

The Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
 
We will remain an “emerging growth company: until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion non-convertible debt in a three year period, (3) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (4) when the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.
 
To the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirements to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years.
