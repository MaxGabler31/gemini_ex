Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are leaders in discovering and developing RNA-targeted therapeutics. We have created an efficient and broadly applicable drug discovery platform leveraging our expertise in antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics. Using this platform, we have developed a large, diverse and advanced pipeline of potentially first-in-class and/or best-in-class drugs that we believe can provide high value for patients with significant unmet medical needs. In this way, we believe we are fundamentally changing medicine with the goal to transform the lives of those suffering from severe, often life-threatening, diseases.
 
We made significant progress toward this goal with the commercial launch of SPINRAZA (nusinersen) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, in pediatric and adult patients. SMA is a leading genetic cause of death in infants marked by progressive, debilitating muscle weakness. SPINRAZA became the first and only approved drug to treat people with SMA and is now the standard of care for this debilitating disease. Our partner, Biogen, is responsible for global commercial activities. In January 2018, Biogen reported that SPINRAZA was available in over 30 global markets. Additionally, Biogen is continuing to purse regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA in countries around the world. In 2017, we earned $113 million in commercial revenue from SPINRAZA royalties. We also earned a $50 million milestone payment for the EU approval of SPINRAZA and a $40 million milestone payment for SPINRAZA pricing approval in Japan.
 
Our pipeline also contains two near-term, potentially transformative medicines for two different severe and rare diseases, each with significant commercial potential, inotersen and volanesorsen. We believe inotersen has the potential to become the preferred treatment option for many people with hereditary TTR amyloidosis, or hATTR. Our goal is to free these people from the burden of their disease. hATTR is a debilitating, progressive, fatal disease in which patients experience a progressive buildup of amyloid plaque deposits in tissues throughout the body. In May 2017, we reported positive top-line data from our Phase 3 study of inotersen, NEURO-TTR, in patients with hATTR with polyneuropathy. More than half of these patients also have cardiomyopathy. We are advancing inotersen to the market based on the positive data from our NEURO-TTR study. In November 2017, we filed for marketing authorization for inotersen to treat people with hATTR in the U.S. and EU. The Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, accepted the inotersen New Drug Application, or NDA, for Priority Review and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date of July 6, 2018. The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, also granted accelerated assessment to inotersen, which may reduce standard review time. We are on track in our pre-commercial preparations for a potential launch in mid-2018, if inotersen is approved. Our goals for inotersen are to maximize the commercial potential of the drug, maximize our commercial participation and continue to build our TTR franchise by moving IONIS-TTR-LRx forward rapidly. We plan to commercialize inotersen in North America ourselves and to seek a commercial partner in other geographic regions.
 
Akcea Therapeutics, Inc., or Akcea, our affiliate focused on developing and commercializing drugs for serious cardiometabolic diseases caused by lipid disorders, is working closely with us to develop volanesorsen to treat two severe and rare, genetically defined diseases, familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, and familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL. FCS and FPL are orphan diseases characterized by severely high triglyceride levels that result in severe, daily symptoms and a high risk of life-threatening pancreatitis. We estimate that FCS and FPL each affect 3,000 to 5,000 people globally. The clinical development program for volanesorsen consists of three Phase 3 studies called APPROACH, BROADEN and COMPASS. In the first quarter of 2017, we and Akcea reported positive Phase 3 data from the APPROACH study in patients with FCS. In December 2016, we and Akcea reported positive results from the Phase 3 COMPASS study in patients with triglycerides above 500 mg/dL. Based on the positive data from our Phase 3 studies, Akcea filed for marketing authorization for volanesorsen in the U.S., EU and Canada in the third quarter of 2017. The FDA set a PDUFA date of August 30, 2018 for volanesorsen and an advisory committee meeting is scheduled for May 10, 2018. Volanesorsen was granted Priority Review in Canada. Akcea is on track in its pre-commercial preparations for a potential launch in mid-2018, if volanesorsen is approved.
 
In addition to preparing to commercialize volanesorsen, Akcea is focused on developing and commercializing three other clinical-stage drugs for serious cardiometabolic diseases caused by lipid disorders: AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, each of which could potentially treat multiple patient populations. Moving these drugs into Akcea allows us to retain substantial value from them and ensures our core focus remains on innovation. Akcea completed its initial public offering, or IPO, and a concurrent private placement with Novartis in July 2017, raising over $180 million in net proceeds. As a result of Akcea’s IPO and as of February 2018, we owned approximately 68 percent of Akcea.
 
We are addressing a broad spectrum of diseases that affect millions of people, such as cardiovascular disease, clotting disorders, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. We also are addressing rare diseases, such as acromegaly, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, beta-thalassemia and Huntington’s disease. We are continuing to advance our mid-stage drugs in development, which have the potential to enter late-stage clinical development and progress toward the market over the next several years, like IONIS-HTTRx. IONIS-HTTRx is the first drug in clinical development to target the cause of Huntington’s disease, or HD, by reducing the production of toxic mutant huntingtin, or mHTT, protein. In December 2017, following successful completion of the Phase 1/2 study in which IONIS-HTTRx demonstrated dose-dependent reductions of the mHTT protein in patients with HD, Roche licensed IONIS-HTTRx for $45 million. We plan to report data from this Phase 1/2 study in early 2018. We have also initiated an open-label extension, or OLE, study for people who participated in the Phase 1/2 study. Roche is now responsible for all IONIS-HTTRx development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs.

The depth of our knowledge and expertise with antisense technology, together with our strong financial position, provides us with the flexibility to determine the optimal development and commercialization strategy to maximize the near and longer-term value of our drugs. We have distinct partnering strategies that we employ based on the specific drug, therapeutic area and expertise and resources our potential partners may bring to the collaboration. For some drugs, we may choose to develop and commercialize them through wholly owned subsidiaries or majority owned affiliates like Akcea. In general, these are drugs, like volanesorsen, that we have the internal expertise to advance, that have a clear development path with manageable costs and that have the potential for initial rare disease indications. For other drugs, we may form partnerships that enable us to leverage our partner’s global expertise and resources needed to support large commercial opportunities, as we did with Bayer and Novartis.
 
We have established alliances with a cadre of leading global pharmaceutical companies that are working alongside us in developing our drugs, advancing our technology and preparing to commercialize our products. Our partners bring substantial resources and expertise that augment and build upon our internal capabilities. We have strategic partnerships with Biogen and AstraZeneca through which we can broadly expand our drug discovery efforts to new disease targets in specific therapeutic areas. We also have partnerships with Bayer, GSK, Janssen, Novartis and Roche. Each of these companies brings significant expertise and global resources to develop and potentially commercialize the drugs under these partnerships. In January 2017, we and Akcea initiated a collaboration with Novartis to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. As a leader in the cardiovascular disease space, Novartis brings significant resources and expertise that should support the development and commercialization of these two drugs for significant high-risk patient populations. The collaboration with Novartis should enable us to accelerate the development of these drugs for broader patient populations as Novartis plans to conduct a cardiovascular outcomes study for each of these drugs following successful completion of Phase 2 dose-ranging studies. In addition, Akcea has the right to co-commercialize these drugs using its specialized sales force focused on lipid specialists in select markets. We also form early stage research and development partnerships that allow us to expand the application of our technology to new therapeutic areas. For example, under our collaboration with Janssen, we have licensed IONIS-JBI1-2.5Rx and IONIS-JBI2-2.5Rx, two antisense drugs we discovered to treat autoimmune disorders in the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract. Our collaboration with Janssen combines our RNA-targeted technology platform and Janssen’s expertise in autoimmune disorders and therapeutic formulation. Lastly, we also work with a group of companies that can develop our drugs and utilize our technologies outside our primary areas of focus. We refer to these companies as satellite companies.
 
Through our partnerships, we have created a broad and sustaining base of research and development, or R&D, revenue in the form of license fees, upfront payments and milestone payments while spending prudently to advance our pipeline and technology. Our R&D revenue has consistently grown year over year since 2011. In 2017, we earned $386 million in R&D revenue. Moreover, we have the potential to earn over $13 billion in future milestone payments and licensing fees from our current partnerships. We also have the potential to share in the future commercial success of our inventions and drugs resulting from our partnerships through royalty arrangements. In late 2016, we began adding commercial revenue from SPINRAZA royalties to our existing R&D revenue base. Looking forward, we have the potential to increase our commercial revenue from SPINRAZA royalties from the continued growth we expect in the U.S., EU and in other markets globally. We also have the potential to further increase our commercial revenue with volanesorsen and inotersen. We believe we have the key elements in place to achieve sustained, long-term financial growth, with multiple drivers of revenue; a mature, broad and rapidly-advancing clinical pipeline; a partnership strategy that leverages our partner resources; and an innovative drug discovery technology platform that we continue to deploy across a range of therapeutic areas to address both rare and large patient populations.

Drug Discovery and Development
 
Introduction to Drug Discovery
 
Proteins are essential working molecules in a cell. Almost all human diseases result from inappropriate protein production, improper protein activity or loss of a protein. Scientists use traditional drug discovery methods to design drugs to interact with the proteins in the body that are supporting or causing a disease. Antisense drugs are different from traditional small molecule or antibody drugs because antisense drugs can modify the production of proteins by targeting RNAs. In this way, antisense drugs can reduce the production of a disease-causing protein, modify the protein produced or increase the production of a protein that, when absent, causes disease. Antisense drugs also can treat disease by targeting and reducing RNAs that may be causing disease (so called “toxic RNAs”). RNAs are naturally occurring molecules in the body that primarily act as messengers that carry the information the cell needs to produce proteins from the DNA/genes to the protein making complex in the cell. When our antisense drugs bind to the specific RNAs of a particular gene, they will ultimately alter the production of the protein encoded in the target gene or, in the case of disease-causing RNAs, degrade the toxic RNA.
Our Development Projects
 
We are the leader in the discovery and development of an exciting class of RNA-targeted drugs called antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, drugs, or just antisense drugs. With our proprietary drug discovery platform, we can rapidly identify drugs from a wealth of potential targets to treat a broad range of diseases. We focus our efforts in therapeutic areas in which our drugs will work best, efficiently screening many targets in parallel and carefully selecting the best drug candidates. By combining this efficiency with our rational approach to selecting disease targets, we have built a large and diverse portfolio of drugs we designed to treat a variety of health conditions, with an emphasis on severe and rare diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiometabolic diseases, and cancer. We are developing antisense drugs for systemic and local delivery (e.g., intrathecal for CNS diseases, intraocular for ophthalmic diseases, oral local for gastrointestinal diseases and aerosol for diseases of the lung). We expect to continue to add new drugs to our pipeline, building a broad proprietary portfolio of drugs to treat many diseases and creating opportunities to generate substantial revenue. We also continue to improve our scientific understanding of our drugs, including how our drugs impact the biological processes of the diseases we target.
 
With our expertise in discovering and characterizing novel antisense drugs, our scientists can optimize the properties of our antisense drugs for use with particular targets. Our scientists have made significant advances in chemical modifications we use in our antisense drugs, such as with our Generation 2+ antisense drugs, which have increased potency and an improved side effect profile over our earlier generation drugs. Our scientists have further improved upon our second-generation chemistry with our Generation 2.5 chemistry, an advancement that further increases the potency of our drugs, which broadens the tissues in which our drugs can work. We currently have nine Generation 2.5 drugs in development, and we expect that more of our future drugs will incorporate our Generation 2.5 chemistry. In addition to improving the chemical foundation of our drugs, we have also created LIgand-Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology, which we design to enhance the effective uptake of our drugs in particular tissues.
 
With our LICA technology we attached specific chemical structures or molecules to our antisense drugs. With our first LICA conjugate, a complex sugar-like molecule called N-acetylgalactosamine, or GalNac, we have shown an increase in drug potency from 20 to over 30-fold for liver targets, compared to non-conjugated antisense drugs. We currently have 12 LICA drugs in development, including IONIS-AZ4-2.5-LRx, a drug that combines our Generation 2.5 and LICA technology.
 
We have utilized our chemistry advancements, such as Generation 2.5 and LICA, to expand the therapeutic and commercial opportunities of our pipeline. These advancements, along with the manufacturing and analytical processes that are the same for all of our drugs, shorten our timeline from initial concept to the first human dose, when compared to early development timelines for other drug modalities like small molecule and antibody drugs.

The above table lists the drugs in our pipeline that are in clinical trials, in registration for marketing authorization, or commercialized. The table includes the disease indication, a partner (if the drug is partnered), and the development status of each drug. Typically, the names of our drugs incorporate the target of the drug. For example, with IONIS-HTTRx, the RNA produced from the huntingtin gene, represented by the acronym HTT, is the target of the drug. Unless indicated otherwise, the majority of the drugs in our pipeline are Generation 2+ antisense drugs. We differentiate drugs that Akcea is developing by using “AKCEA”, instead of “IONIS” at the beginning of the drug name, such as AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. We differentiate our Generation 2.5 drugs by adding a “2.5” notation at the end of the drug name, such as IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx. We differentiate our LICA drugs by adding an “L” at the end of the drug name, such as IONIS-PKK-LRx. In 2016, we added IONIS-AZ4-2.5-LRx, a drug that combines our Generation 2.5 chemistry and LICA technology, to our preclinical pipeline. As the drugs in our pipeline advance in clinical development, we will adopt nonproprietary names given to each drug from the United States Adopted Names Council. For example, volanesorsen is a nonproprietary name that we obtained for IONIS-APOCIIIRx. Once we or our partners establish a brand name, we will adopt the brand name. For example, SPINRAZA is the brand name for nusinersen.
 
With a pipeline as large and advanced as ours, we have a number of clinical events each year as we initiate new clinical studies, complete and report data from clinical studies, and add numerous new drugs to our pipeline. In 2018, we plan to initiate five Phase 2 studies, report data on six Phase 2 studies and multiple proof-of-concept initial clinical trials and add three to five new drugs into development.
 
Our Marketed Drug
 
SPINRAZA – SPINRAZA (nusinersen) injection, for intrathecal use is a survival motor neuron-2 (SMN2)-directed antisense oligonucleotide indicated for the treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult patients. In July 2016, Biogen licensed SPINRAZA from us. We have transitioned all SPINRAZA development activities to Biogen as they are now responsible for all global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs. In January 2018, Biogen reported that SPINRAZA was available in over 30 global markets.
 
SMA is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. Ultimately, individuals with the most severe type of SMA, infantile-onset SMA, can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing. Due to a loss of, or defect in, the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron, or SMN, protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein a patient can produce on his/her own. Patients with infantile-onset, or Type 1, SMA, the most severe life-threatening form of the disease, produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support or live beyond two years without respiratory support. Patients with later-onset, or Type 2 or Type 3 SMA, produce greater amounts of SMN protein and have less severe, but still life-altering, forms of SMA.

SPINRAZA is administered via intrathecal injection, which delivers therapies directly to the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, around the spinal cord, where motor neurons degenerate in people with SMA due to insufficient levels of SMN protein.
 
The safety and efficacy of SPINRAZA has been evaluated from multiple clinical studies in more than 270 patients, including two Phase 3 studies: ENDEAR, a randomized controlled study evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with infantile-onset SMA, and CHERISH, a randomized controlled study evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with later-onset SMA; as well as open-label studies in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients with, or likely to develop, Types 1, 2 and 3 SMA. 
 
In the ENDEAR end of study analysis, or EOS, a statistically significant greater percentage of children with infant-onset SMA achieved improvement in motor milestones compared to untreated patients, with some infants in the SPINRAZA group achieving full head control, the ability to roll, sitting, and standing. Additionally, infants treated with SPINRAZA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in event-free survival compared to untreated patients. In November 2017, results from EOS analysis, from the ENDEAR study, including the pre-specified primary endpoint, time to death or permanent ventilation, were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. SPINRAZA met the pre-specified primary endpoint at the ENDEAR EOS, demonstrating a statistically significant 47 percent reduction in the risk of death or permanent ventilation (p<0.01). In October 2017, Biogen presented a new analysis from the Phase 3 ENDEAR study that showed infants with SMA who initiated treatment earlier in the disease demonstrated greater benefit and improvement in motor function outcomes.
 
In the CHERISH pre-specified interim analysis, there was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in motor function in children with later-onset SMA treated with SPINRAZA compared to untreated children. In an EOS analysis, children receiving SPINRAZA experienced a highly statistically significant improvement in motor function compared to those who did not receive treatment. The New England Journal of Medicine published these results in February 2018.
 
Additionally, Biogen conducted NURTURE, a Phase 2 open-label study in pre-symptomatic infants. In an interim analysis, SPINRAZA-treated pre-symptomatic infants with SMA achieved motor milestones in timelines more consistent with normal development than what is observed in the natural history of patients with Type 1 SMA. At the time of the interim analysis, all patients were alive and did not require respiratory intervention. Three infants experienced AEs considered possibly related to SPINRAZA, all of which were resolved.
 
Further, in open-label studies, some patients achieved milestones that they would not be expected to achieve, such as the ability to sit unassisted, stand or walk, and maintained milestones at ages that they would expect to lose. The overall findings in the combined clinical studies to date support the effectiveness of SPINRAZA across the range of patients with SMA, and appear to support the early initiation of treatment.
 
In all clinical studies, SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The most common side effects of SPINRAZA included lower and upper respiratory infections, constipation, headache, back pain, and post-lumbar puncture syndrome.

Our Drugs Under Regulatory Review for Marketing Authorization


We have two drugs for which we successfully completed pivotal Phase 3 studies and are now under regulatory review for marketing authorization: inotersen and volanesorsen. These drugs are potentially transformative medicines for two different severe and rare diseases, each with significant commercial potential.
 Inotersen – Inotersen is a Generation 2+ antisense drug we designed to treat people with hereditary TTR amyloidosis, or hATTR, a rare, progressive, fatal disease.
 
In people with hATTR, both the mutant and wild type, or wt, TTR protein builds up as fibrils in the tissues, such as peripheral nerves, heart, gastrointestinal system, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow. The presence of TTR fibrils interferes with the normal function of these tissues. As the TTR protein fibrils enlarge, more tissue damage occurs and the disease worsens, resulting in poor quality of life and eventually death. We designed inotersen to reduce the production of the TTR protein, the underlying cause of ATTR. Inotersen is administered as a once weekly, self-administered, at-home, subcutaneous injection.
 
TTR amyloidosis that is the result of inherited mutations in the TTR gene is referred to as hATTR. There are an estimated 50,000 people worldwide with hATTR. There are two primary manifestations of hATTR: polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Many people with hATTR often experience both manifestations, but often one symptom or the other is diagnosed first and is more pronounced. Polyneuropathy due to hATTR is caused by the accumulation of misfolded mutated TTR protein in the peripheral nerves. People with polyneuropathy due to hATTR experience ongoing debilitating nerve damage throughout their body resulting in the progressive loss of sensation in the extremities that progresses centrally, and progressive loss of motor functions, such as walking. These people also accumulate TTR in other major organs, which progressively compromise their function and eventually leads to death within five to fifteen years of disease onset. ATTR cardiomyopathy is caused by the accumulation of misfolded TTR protein in the cardiac muscle. ATTR can also result from normal, non-mutant, TTR protein forming fibrils, primarily in the heart. This form of the disease is referred to as wt-ATTR. It is estimated that more than 200,000 people worldwide have wt-ATTR. People with hATTR cardiomyopathy and wt-ATTR experience ongoing debilitating heart damage resulting in progressive heart failure, which results in death within 3 to 5 years from disease onset.

In May 2017, we completed the NEURO-TTR study, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, international Phase 3 study in patients with polyneuropathy due to hATTR. Results from the study demonstrated benefit compared to placebo across both primary endpoints of the study: the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy, or Norfolk QoL-DN, and the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7, or mNIS+7, at both eight and 15 months of treatment. In addition, consistent and significant benefit was observed in both the Norfolk-QoL-DN and mNIS+7, independent of disease stage, types of mutation, previous treatment with TTR protein stabilizers or presence of cardiomyopathy. Inotersen-treated patients benefited significantly in the quality of life primary endpoint with 50 percent demonstrating improvement from baseline. Inotersen-treated patients achieved a mean 11.68 point benefit in the Norfolk QoL-DN score at 15 months of treatment compared to placebo-treated patients (mean change from baseline of 0.99 vs. 12.67, p=0.0006). In addition, clinically meaningful benefit compared to placebo was observed in the SF-36 physical component score, a measure of general health and quality of life. Inotersen-treated patients also benefited significantly in the co-primary endpoint of disease control, mNIS+7, with a mean 19.73-point benefit observed after 15 months of treatment, compared to placebo-treated patients (p = 0.00000004).
 
Two key safety issues were identified during the study: thrombocytopenia and safety signals related to renal function. Enhanced monitoring was implemented during the study to support early detection and management of these issues. Serious platelet and renal events were infrequent and manageable with routine monitoring, which has proven effective since implementation. Other serious adverse events were observed in 24.1 percent of inotersen-treated patients and 21.7 percent of placebo-treated patients. No cumulative toxicities have been identified with long-term exposure. 
 
Adverse events occurring in ≥ 10 percent of patients and twice as frequently in inotersen-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients, included thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreases, nausea, pyrexia, chills, vomiting, and anemia. Injection site reactions accounted for less than 1 percent of all injections and were mild or moderate in severity. There were no discontinuations due to injection site reactions.
 
The overall mortality rate in the NEURO-TTR study was 2.9 percent and was lower than mortality rates reported in other studies in patients with hATTR. There was a total of five deaths in the study, five (4.7 percent) in the inotersen arm and zero in the placebo arm. Four deaths in the inotersen arm were associated with disease progression and considered unrelated to treatment. As previously reported, there was one fatal intracranial hemorrhage in conjunction with serious thrombocytopenia. No serious thrombocytopenia was observed following implementation of more frequent monitoring.
 
Inotersen is currently under regulatory review for marketing authorization in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of hATTR. Inotersen has been granted Priority Review by the FDA and has a PDUFA date of July 6, 2018. The EMA also granted accelerated assessment to inotersen, which may reduce standard review time. In addition, an open-label extension study, or OLE, is ongoing for patients who have completed the NEURO-TTR study, in which all patients are treated with inotersen. We have also opened an expanded access program, or EAP, for eligible patients, beginning with sites in the U.S.
 
We plan to commercialize inotersen in North America ourselves and to seek a commercial partner in other geographic regions.
 
Volanesorsen – Volanesorsen is a Generation 2+ antisense drug Akcea and we are developing to treat people with FCS and FPL, which are severe, rare, genetically defined diseases characterized by extremely elevated triglyceride levels and a high risk of life-threatening pancreatitis.
 
Due to the high levels of triglycerides in their blood, people with FCS may suffer from many chronic health issues including severe, recurrent abdominal pain, fatigue, high risk of life-threatening pancreatitis and abnormal enlargement of the liver or spleen. In addition, people with FCS have to adhere to a very strict, low-fat diet. As a result of these factors, people with FCS and FPL are often unable to work, adding to the burden of the disease. While all the complications of FCS or FPL cause patients to have a lower quality of life, pancreatitis is the most serious consequence of the disease. In severe cases, patients can have bleeding into the pancreas, serious tissue damage, infection and cyst formation, as well as damage to other vital organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. We estimate there are 3,000 to 5,000 people with FCS in treatable markets and an additional 3,000 to 5,000 people with FPL globally.
 
Volanesorsen acts to reduce triglyceride levels by inhibiting the production of apolipoprotein C-III, or apoC-III, a protein that is a key regulator of triglyceride clearance. People who have low levels of apoC-III or reduced apoC-III function have lower levels of triglycerides and a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease, or CVD. By inhibiting the production of apoC-III, volanesorsen is able to increase triglyceride clearance in people with FCS, reducing their triglyceride levels.
 
The marketing application for volanesorsen for the treatment of FCS is based on data from the Phase 3 APPROACH and COMPASS studies. The pivotal APPROACH study, a one-year, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 66 patients with FCS (average baseline triglycerides of 2,209 mg/dL, or 25.0 mmol/L), achieved its primary endpoint of reduction in triglycerides at three months, with a 77 percent mean reduction in triglycerides, which translated into a 1,712 mg/dL (19.3 mmol/L) mean absolute triglyceride reduction in volanesorsen-treated patients. Akcea observed 50 percent of treated patients achieved triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL, a commonly accepted threshold for pancreatitis risk. In addition, in the APPROACH study, treatment with volanesorsen was associated with a statistically significant reduced rate of pancreatitis attacks in the group of patients who had the highest incidence of pre-study pancreatitis, and reduced abdominal pain in patients reporting pain before treatment in the study. The COMPASS study, a six-month randomized placebo-controlled study in 113 patients with very high triglycerides (>500 mg/dL), also achieved its primary endpoint of reduction in triglycerides at three months, with a 71 percent mean reduction in triglycerides. In the COMPASS study, treatment with volanesorsen was associated with a statistically significant reduction in on-study pancreatitis attacks. 
 
The most common adverse event in the studies was injection site reactions, which were mostly mild. In addition, declines in platelet counts were observed in many patients and some patients discontinued the study because of platelet declines. These platelet declines were not clinically significant in most patients and were generally well managed with monitoring and dose adjustment. Some patients discontinued participation in the APPROACH study due to other non-serious adverse events, including sweating and chills, severe fatigue, rash and injection site reaction. In the APPROACH study and the open label extension study,  the potentially treatment-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, observed were serious platelet events (grade 4 thrombocytopenia), which resolved without complication after cessation of dosing. Enhanced monitoring was implemented during the study to support early detection and management of these issues. Since implementation of the enhanced monitoring, serious platelet events have been infrequent. In the COMPASS study, the most common adverse event in the volanesorsen-treated group of patients was injection site reactions, which were mostly mild, and a potentially treatment-related SAE of serum sickness reaction, from which the patient fully recovered. There have been no deaths and no treatment-related bleeding or cardiovascular events in any volanesorsen clinical study.

Akcea and we continue to conduct the BROADEN study, a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with FPL, which continues to enroll, with data expected in 2019.
 
An open-label extension study is ongoing for patients with FCS who have completed or meet the study criteria for the APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Patients in the BROADEN study are also eligible to roll over into an open-label extension study upon completing dosing in the pivotal study.
 
Volanesorsen for the treatment of FCS is currently under regulatory review for marketing authorization in the U.S., EU and Canada. Volanesorsen has a PDUFA date of August 30, 2018 and an advisory committee meeting is scheduled for May 10, 2018. Volanesorsen has been granted priority review in Canada and a Promising Innovative Medicine, or PIM, designation by the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA. The U.S. and European regulatory agencies have granted Orphan Drug Designation to volanesorsen for the treatment of people with FCS. The European regulatory agency has also granted Orphan Drug Designation to volanesorsen for the treatment of FPL. In addition, Akcea and we have an ongoing OLE study of volanesorsen in people with FCS, in which all patients are treated with volanesorsen. Akcea and we also opened an EAP for eligible patients. Our EAP program is being initiated on a country-by-country basis globally and is currently available in select countries in Europe.
 
Akcea plans to globally commercialize volanesorsen for both FCS and FPL, if approved.

Neurological Disease Franchise
 
We are discovering and developing antisense drugs to treat people with inadequate treatment options for both rare and common neurological diseases. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, or NINDS, at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, a third of the 7,000 known rare diseases are neurological disorders or thought to include a neurological component.

Inotersen – See the drug description under “Our Drugs Under Regulatory Review for Marketing Authorization” section above.
 
IONIS-HTTRx – IONIS-HTTRx is a Generation 2+ antisense drug we designed to target the underlying cause of HD by reducing the production of the toxic mHTT protein. We and Roche entered into a collaboration to develop and commercialize antisense drugs to treat HD in April 2013. Roche licensed IONIS-HTTRx from us in December 2017. Roche is now responsible for all IONIS-HTTRx development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs, including managing the ongoing OLE and all future studies.
 
HD is a rare, inherited, genetic brain disorder that results in the progressive deterioration of mental abilities and physical control. In the U.S., there are approximately 30,000 individuals with symptomatic HD and more than 200,000 people at risk of inheriting HD. HD is a triplet repeat disorder and is one of a large family of genetic diseases in which the body mistakenly repeats certain gene sequences. The resulting mHTT protein is toxic and gradually damages neurons in the brain. Symptoms of HD usually appear between the ages of 30 to 50 years and continually worsen over a 10 to 25-year period. Ultimately, the weakened individual succumbs to pneumonia, heart failure or other complications. Presently, there is no effective disease-modifying treatment, and current approaches only focus on managing the severity of some disease symptoms.
 
In December 2017, we announced that we had completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation, Phase 1/2a clinical study of IONIS-HTTRx in patients with early stage HD. Dose-dependent reductions of mHTT were observed among patients treated with IONIS-HTTRx, with a safety and tolerability profile supporting continued development.
 
The FDA and EMA have granted Orphan Drug Designation for IONIS-HTTRx to treat people with HD.

IONIS-SOD1Rx – IONIS-SOD1Rx is a Generation 2+ antisense drug we designed to reduce the production of superoxide dismutase 1, or SOD1, which is the best understood genetic cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. We are collaborating with Biogen to develop IONIS-SOD1Rx to treat people with an inherited form of ALS, SOD1-ALS.
 
ALS is a rare, fatal, neurodegenerative disorder. People with ALS suffer progressive degeneration of the motor neurons, which results in a declining quality of life and ultimately death. The second most common familial form of ALS is SOD1-ALS, in which people have a mutation in the SOD1 gene that causes a progressive loss of motor neurons. As a result, people with SOD1-ALS experience muscle weakness, loss of movement, difficulty in breathing and swallowing and eventually succumb to their disease. Currently, treatment options for people with ALS are extremely limited with no drugs that significantly slow disease progression.
 
Biogen is evaluating IONIS-SOD1Rx in a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation, Phase 1/2 clinical study in patients with ALS, including patients with SOD1-ALS.
 
IONIS-MAPTRx – IONIS-MAPTRx is a Generation 2+ antisense drug designed to selectively reduce production of the tau protein in the brain. We are collaborating with Biogen to develop IONIS-MAPTRx to treat people with Alzheimer's disease, or AD, and frontotemporal dementia, or FTD.
 
Microtubule-associated protein tau, or MAPT, or tau, is thought to be a contributor or cause of certain neurodegenerative diseases, known as tauopathies, that are characterized by the deposition of abnormal tau protein in neurons and glia in the brain. These disorders include AD, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, or PSP, and some forms of FTD.
 
We and Biogen are evaluating IONIS-MAPTRx in a Phase 1/2a, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and activity of once-monthly intrathecal injections in patients with mild AD.
 
Severe and Rare Disease Franchise
 
Our severe and rare disease franchise is the largest franchise in our pipeline. We are discovering and developing antisense drugs to treat people with severe and rare diseases who need new treatment options. We believe our antisense technology could offer effective therapies for these people. According to the NIH there are approximately 5,000 to 8,000 rare diseases, many life-threatening or fatal. Unfortunately, people with many of these severe and rare diseases have few effective therapies available. Since most of these diseases are genetic or have a genetic component, parents often pass the disease to their children, creating a legacy of the disease resulting in profound effects on the family.
 
Due to the severe nature of these diseases and the lack of available treatments, there is an opportunity for more flexible and efficient development paths to the market. This means that, in some cases, the studies necessary for us to demonstrate proof-of-concept with a particular drug may also be the studies that complete our marketing registration package, thereby providing us with a relatively rapid path to market for potential new treatments for these devastating and often fatal diseases. For example, SPINRAZA was approved five years after we began the Phase 1 study for it.

Kynamro – Kynamro (mipomersen sodium) injection is an oligonucleotide inhibitor of apolipoprotein B-100 synthesis indicated as an adjunct to lipid-lowering medications and diet, to reduce low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, or LDL-C, apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, and non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH. Kynamro is approved for use in people with HoFH in the U.S. and several other countries. In 2016 Kastle acquired the global rights to develop and commercialize Kynamro and also began marketing and selling Kynamro.

IONIS-GHR-LRx – IONIS-GHR-LRx is a LICA drug we designed to reduce the production of the growth hormone receptor, or GHr, to decrease the circulating level of insulin-like growth factor-1, or IGF-1. IGF-1 is a hormone primarily produced in the liver that plays an important role in childhood growth and has anabolic effects in adults. Several different diseases result from abnormally low or high levels of IGF-1, or an inappropriate response to this hormone. When produced in excess, IGF-1 results in acromegaly, a chronic, slowly progressing and life-threatening disease.
 
We have completed a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of IONIS-GHR-LRx in healthy volunteers. Results from the Phase 1 study demonstrated an acceptable safety profile supportive of continued development.
 
IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx – IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx is a LICA drug we designed to reduce the production of transmembrane protease, serine 6, or TMPRSS6, to treat anemia and iron toxicity in people with β-thalassemia; a disease caused by mutations in the beta globin gene. TMPRSS6 is a protein produced in the liver that plays an important role in the regulation of the body's iron homeostasis through the control of the iron regulatory protein hepcidin. Inhibition of TMPRSS6 leads to increased production of hepcidin, which results in more effective red blood cell production in the bone marrow and reduced iron toxicity in the liver as a result of improved control of iron availability. Results from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that reducing levels of TMPRSS6 may be an effective strategy to control iron availability, improve liver iron toxicity and increase red blood cell production under conditions of β-thalassemia.
 
We are currently evaluating IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers.
 
IONIS-PKKRx and IONIS-PKK-LRx – IONIS-PKKRx and IONIS-PKK-LRx are antisense drugs we designed to reduce the production of prekallikrein, or PKK, to treat people with hereditary angioedema, or HAE. HAE is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by rapid and painful attacks of inflammation in the hands, feet, limbs, face, abdomen, larynx and trachea and can be fatal if swelling occurs in the larynx. PKK plays an important role in the activation of inflammatory mediators associated with acute attacks of HAE. By inhibiting the production of PKK, IONIS-PKKRx and IONIS-PKK-LRx could be effective prophylactic approaches to preventing HAE attacks. In patients with frequent or severe attacks, doctors may use prophylactic treatment approaches to prevent or reduce the severity of HAE attacks. However, current prophylactic treatment approaches are very limited and have major tolerability issues due to challenging administration requirements leaving patients with few therapeutic options.
 
We have completed a Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-PKKRx in healthy volunteers and we are exploring potential development options. We are currently evaluating IONIS-PKK-LRx in a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers. The Phase 1 study is evaluating single and multiple doses of IONIS-PKK-LRx administered subcutaneously.
 
Cardiometabolic and Renal Disease Franchise
 
Cardiovascular disease, or CVD, is an important area of focus for us. According to the World Health Organization, or WHO, cardiovascular disease was the number 1 cause of death globally. An estimated 17.7 million people died from CVDs in 2015, representing 31 percent of all global deaths. The drugs in our cardiovascular franchise target the key components of cardiovascular disease, including various atherogenic lipids, inflammation and thrombosis. Metabolic disorders are chronic diseases that affect millions of people. There is a significant need for new therapies for these people. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, diabetes affects more than 29 million people in the U.S., or nine percent of the population, with type 2 diabetes constituting 90 to 95 percent of those cases.

IONIS-FXIRx – IONIS-FXIRx is a Generation 2+ antisense drug we designed to reduce the production of Factor XI. Factor XI is a clotting factor produced in the liver that is important in the growth of blood clots. High levels of Factor XI increase the risk of thrombosis, which is the formation of a blood clot inside blood vessels. Thrombosis can cause heart attacks and strokes. People who are deficient in Factor XI have a lower incidence of thromboembolic events with minimal increase in bleeding risk. Although currently available anticoagulants reduce the risk of thrombosis, physicians associate these anticoagulants with increased bleeding, which can be fatal. Given the mechanism of Factor XI inhibition, we believe that our drug has the potential to be used broadly as an anti-thrombotic in many different therapeutic settings for which additional safe and well tolerated anti-thrombotic drugs are needed.
 
We completed a Phase 2 open-label, comparator-controlled global study evaluating IONIS-FXIRx in people undergoing total knee replacement surgery. The study compared the safety and activity of IONIS-FXIRx to enoxaparin. In this study patients treated with 300 mg of IONIS-FXIRx experienced a seven-fold lower rate of venous thromboembolic events, such as blood clots in a deep vein or in a lung, compared to those patients treated with enoxaparin. The data from this study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in December 2014. In May 2015, we exclusively licensed IONIS-FXIRx to Bayer.
 
In November 2016, we completed a Phase 2 double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study of IONIS-FXIRx in people with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. In this Phase 2 study, patients treated with IONIS-FXIRx achieved statistically significant, dose-dependent reductions in Factor XI activity. There were no clinically meaningful reductions in platelets and no treatment-related major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events.
 
We are currently evaluating IONIS-FXIRx in a Phase 2b study in approximately 200 people with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis to finalize dose selection.
 
IONIS-GCGRRx – IONIS-GCGRRx is a Generation 2+ antisense drug we designed to reduce the production of glucagon receptors, or GCGR, to treat people with type 2 diabetes. GCGR is a receptor for the hormone glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that opposes the action of insulin and stimulates the liver to produce glucose, particularly in type 2 diabetes. We are developing IONIS-GCGRRx to provide better glucose control for people with type 2 diabetes. In people with advanced diabetes, uncontrolled glucagon action can lead to significant increases in blood glucose level. In addition, reducing GCGR produces more active glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, a hormone that preserves pancreatic function and enhances insulin secretion. We are developing IONIS-GCGRRx with Suzhou Ribo Life Sciences Co., for the treatment of diabetes in China.
 
In January 2017, we reported results from a Phase 2 dose optimization study in which patients treated with IONIS-GCGRRx achieved robust and sustained, statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c, and other measures of glucose control after 26 weeks of treatment. Additionally, IONIS-GCGRRx-treated patients experienced a mean increase in total GLP-1 from baseline compared to a decline in placebo-treated patients. The safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-GCGRRx in the Phase 2 program supports continued development.
 
In March 2017, we licensed IONIS-GCGRRx to Ribo to develop and commercialize the drug in China.
 
IONIS-DGAT2Rx – IONIS-DGAT2Rx is a Generation 2+ antisense drug we designed to reduce the production of DGAT2, or diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, to treat people with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. NASH is a common liver disease characterized by excessive triglycerides in the liver with concurrent inflammation and cellular damage. As NASH progresses, scarring, or fibrosis, begins to accumulate in the liver. Ultimately, cirrhosis of the liver develops and the liver can no longer function normally. Currently, it is estimated that two to three percent of the general population have NASH. However, with the growing obesity epidemic, the number of people with NASH should also continue to rise. About 20 percent of people with NASH are reported to have a liver that does not function properly due to long-term damage, known as cirrhosis. Of those with NASH-related cirrhosis, 30 to 40 percent experience liver-related death. Currently, liver transplantation is the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis and liver failure. Because of the high prevalence of NASH, it has recently become the third most common indication for liver transplantation in the U.S.
 
DGAT2 is an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in triglyceride synthesis in the liver. Reducing the production of DGAT2 should therefore decrease triglyceride synthesis in the liver. In animal models of obesity and fatty liver disease, antisense inhibition of DGAT2 significantly improved non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, lowered blood lipid levels and reversed diet-induced insulin resistance. NASH is a more severe form of NAFLD.
 
We are evaluating IONIS-DGAT2Rx in a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD.
 
IONIS-AGT-LRx – IONIS-AGT-LRx is a LICA drug we designed to reduce the production of angiotensinogen to decrease blood pressure in people with treatment resistant hypertension, or TRH. Despite availability of generic antihypertensive agents, TRH is a major contributor to cardiovascular and renal disease.
 
We are evaluating IONIS-AGT-LRx in a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1/2a study in healthy volunteers.

Cancer Franchise and Other Drugs in Development
 
Cancer is an area of significant unmet medical need. Cancer is an extremely complex disease that involves a large number of targets. Using our antisense technology, we can validate multiple potential cancer targets from a variety of different cancers, and rapidly identify anti-cancer drugs, which in many cases are the same or similar sequences to those used to validate the target. We preferentially select anti-cancer targets that provide a multi-faceted approach to treating cancer.
 
Our cancer franchise consists of anti-cancer antisense drugs that act upon biological targets associated with cancer progression and/or treatment resistance. We have a strategic alliance with AstraZeneca, which includes an anti-cancer collaboration that expands our anti-cancer efforts and supports a robust clinical development plan for IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx and IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx. AstraZeneca brings significant experience that enables the identification of novel genetic and epigenetic targets for cancer. Combining AstraZeneca’s expertise with our drug discovery technology, we plan to expand our cancer franchise with a number of promising new anti-cancer targets. We also have a collaboration agreement with University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to identify cancer targets and create novel antisense drugs to treat cancer together.
 
Our Generation 2.5 chemistry enhances the potency and effectiveness of our antisense drugs, and potentially allows us to extend the applicability of our technology to cancers that are difficult to treat. For instance, STAT3 is a protein known to be important in carcinogenesis, however, it has been difficult to approach with traditional drug modalities. Data from a Phase 1b/2 clinical study of IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx in combination with Imfinzi (durvalumab), AstraZeneca’s programmed death ligand (PD-L1) blocking antibody showed evidence of antitumor activity in people with advanced solid tumors and recurrent metastatic head and neck cancer.
 
In addition to cancer programs, we continue to advance other drugs in development that are outside of our core therapeutic areas, such as IONIS-FB-LRx for compliment-mediated diseases, and the antiviral drugs we and GSK are developing.
 
IONIS’ Oncology/Other Pipeline


IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx – IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx, also referred to as AZD9150, is a Generation 2.5 antisense drug we designed to reduce the production of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, or STAT3, to treat people with cancer. STAT3 is a protein involved in the translation of key factors critical for tumor cell growth and survival. STAT3 is over-active in a variety of cancers, including brain, lung, breast, bone, liver and multiple myeloma. Physicians believe that overactivity in STAT3 prevents cancer cell death and promotes tumor cell growth. IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx is a part of our collaboration with AstraZeneca to discover and develop anti-cancer drugs. We believe the significant potency we observed in our preclinical studies with IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx broadens the therapeutic opportunities for IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx into many different types of cancer in which STAT3 is implicated.
 
In September 2017, we and AstraZeneca announced data from a Phase 1b/2 study of IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx in combination with Imfinzi (durvalumab), AstraZeneca’s PD-L1 blocking antibody, in people with advanced solid tumors and recurrent metastatic head and neck cancer. The treatment combination demonstrated a 29 percent (8/28) objective response rate with four partial responses, or PR, and four complete responses, or CR, of which one was a CR in target lesions only. An additional eight people on the treatment combination had stable disease, or SD, at 12 weeks, resulting in an overall disease control rate of 57 percent (16/28). A complete response was seen in a person with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck that was refractory to previous PD-L1 treatment. IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx in combination with Imfinzi demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile supporting continued development.
 
IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx - IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx, also referred to as AZD4785, is a Generation 2.5 antisense drug designed to selectively inhibit KRAS, one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer. KRAS mutations are thought to underlie the pathogenesis of up to 30 percent of human tumors. The KRAS protein is involved in regulating cell division and tumor cell survival. IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx is a part of our collaboration with AstraZeneca to discover and develop anti-cancer drugs.
 
AstraZeneca is evaluating IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx in a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study in people with advanced solid tumors for whom KRAS may be an important driver of tumor survival.
 
IONIS-HBVRx and IONIS-HBV-LRx – IONIS-HBVRx and IONIS-HBV-LRx are antisense drugs we designed to reduce the production of viral proteins associated with hepatitis B virus, or HBV. These include proteins associated with infection and replication, including the hepatitis B surface antigen, which is present in both acute and chronic infections and is associated with a poor prognosis in people with chronic HBV infection. IONIS-HBV-LRx is our first anti-infective drug in development that incorporates our LICA technology. Together with GSK, we are evaluating IONIS-HBVRx and IONIS-HBV-LRx to treat HBV infection.
 
 14
 

HBV infection is a serious health problem that can lead to significant and potentially fatal health conditions, including cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection is one of the most common persistent viral infections in the world. Currently available therapies, although effective in reducing circulating HBV in the blood, do not effectively inhibit HBV antigen production and secretion, which are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of liver cancer.
 
We and GSK are evaluating both IONIS-HBVRx and IONIS-HBV-LRx in Phase 2 studies in people with HBV infection.
 
IONIS-AR-2.5Rx – IONIS-AR-2.5Rx is a Generation 2.5 antisense drug we designed to treat people with prostate cancer by reducing the production of all known forms of androgen receptor, or AR, including variants of the AR gene. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. Prostate cancer growth, proliferation and progression are all androgen-dependent and AR function is involved in disease progression at all stages of prostate cancer. For people diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, current treatments largely involve opposing the action of androgens by blocking the AR or removing circulating androgens. Although androgen deprivation therapy approaches are initially effective in delaying disease progression, people with metastatic prostate cancer will progress in their disease. Resistance to current therapies is frequent and can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including the activation of AR signaling in tumor cells through the amplification, over expression and mutation of the AR gene. Because IONIS-AR-2.5Rx can inhibit the production of all known forms of AR, we believe that this drug has the potential to be useful in treating people with all stages of prostate cancer, including those who are resistant to current therapies.
 
AstraZeneca completed an open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 1/2 clinical study of IONIS-AR-2.5Rx in people with advanced tumors for which the androgen receptor pathway is potentially a contributing factor. The drug exhibited a good safety and tolerability profile supportive of continued development. In March 2017, we licensed IONIS-AR-2.5Rx to Ribo to develop and commercialize the drug in China.
 
IONIS-FB-LRx - IONIS-FB-LRx is a LICA drug we designed to reduce the production of complement factor B, or FB. FB is produced predominantly in the liver and circulates at high levels throughout the vascular system where it plays a pivotal role in an innate immunogenic cascade. Genetic association studies have shown that overaction of this cascade has been associated with the development of several complement-mediated diseases, including dry age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. FB, which plays a pivotal role in this cascade, is produced predominately in the liver and circulates at high levels throughout the vascular system, including in capillaries in the eye.
 
In May 2017, we reported data from a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1 study evaluating IONIS-FB-LRx in 54 healthy volunteers. Subjects treated with a single dose of IONIS-FB-LRx achieved dose-dependent reductions in plasma FB of up to 50 percent. Treatment with multiple doses of IONIS-FB-LRx during a six-week period resulted in greater reductions in circulating FB levels. The safety and tolerability profile of IONIS-FB-LRx supports further clinical development.
 
We are currently evaluating IONIS-FB-LRx in a Phase 2 study in people with dry AMD.
 
Preclinical Drugs in Development
 
The efficiency and broad applicability of our technology provides us with nearly unlimited targets against which to develop drugs. On average, it takes 12 to 18 months to complete the preclinical studies necessary to support clinical development. Over the last year we added eight new drugs to our preclinical pipeline.

Akcea Therapeutics: Our Affiliate Focused on Developing and Commercializing Drugs to Treat People with Serious Cardiometabolic Diseases Caused by Lipid Disorders
 
 Akcea Therapeutics is our development and commercialization affiliate that we formed in late 2014 to focus on developing and commercializing drugs to treat people with serious cardiometabolic diseases caused by lipid disorders. As part of its formation, we granted Akcea exclusive rights to develop and commercialize volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. These four novel drugs are based on our antisense technology and have the potential to treat multiple indications. We describe each of these drugs in more detail below.
 
Akcea is assembling the global infrastructure to develop the drugs in its pipeline, to commercialize them with a focus on lipid specialists as the primary call point and to create the specialized support required to address rare disease patient populations. Akcea and we entered into a collaboration, option and license agreement with Novartis, in which Akcea granted Novartis an exclusive option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. Both these drugs have the potential to treat people who are at high cardiovascular risk due to inadequately treated lipid disorders. After Akcea completes the Phase 2 development of each of these drugs, Novartis has the option to license each drug. If Novartis licenses one or both drugs, it plans to, for each licensed drug, use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct, at its expense, a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in a high-risk patient population and will be responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization activities. Novartis brings significant resources and expertise that should support the development and commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx for significant high-risk patient populations. Akcea also plans to co-commercialize any such drug through its specialized sales force focused on lipid specialists in selected markets.
 
This report includes financial information for this separate business segment in Note 7, Segment Information and Concentration of Business Risk, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Volanesorsen – Volanesorsen is a Generation 2+ antisense drug under regulatory review for marketing authorization in the U.S., EU and Canada for the treatment of people with FCS. Akcea and we are also developing volanesorsen to treat people with FPL. For more information on the regulatory and development plan for volanesorsen, see the drug description under “Our Drugs under Regulatory Review for Marketing Authorization” section above.
 
AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx – AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is a LICA drug we designed to reduce the production of apolipoprotein(a), or Apo(a), protein in the liver to offer a direct approach for reducing lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for CVD that is composed of an apolipoprotein(a) protein bound to an LDL-cholesterol particle. Akcea initiated a collaboration with Novartis in January 2017 to advance AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx.
 
Akcea is developing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx for people who are at significant risk of CVD because of their elevated levels of Lp(a). AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx inhibits the production of the Apo(a) protein, thereby reducing Lp(a). Lp(a) is a very atherogenic and thrombogenic form of LDL. Elevated Lp(a) is recognized as an independent, genetic cause of coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke and peripheral arterial disease. Inhibiting the production of Apo(a) in the liver reduces the level of Lp(a) in blood, potentially slowing down or reversing cardiovascular disease in people with hyperlipoproteinemia(a), a condition in which individuals have levels of Lp(a) greater than 60 mg/dL.
 
Lp(a) is difficult to inhibit using other technologies, such as small molecules and antibodies; there are multiple genetically-determined forms of the Apo(a) molecule and creating a small molecule or antibody that can interact with multiple targets is difficult. We believe antisense technology is particularly well suited to address hyperlipoproteinemia(a) because it specifically targets the RNA that codes for all forms of the Apo(a) molecule. As a result, it can stop the production of all the forms of the protein. Furthermore, we believe addressing elevated Lp(a) is the next important horizon in lipid-focused treatment and, through Akcea’s collaboration with Novartis, it plans to develop AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx to treat people with established cardiovascular disease in whom hyperlipoproteinemia(a) likely plays a causal role.
 
Akcea and we completed a Phase 1/2a study with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a) and reported results at the American Heart Association, or AHA, annual meeting in November 2015. In this clinical study, we observed significant and sustained reductions in Lp(a) of up to 97 percent with a mean reduction of 79 percent after only a single, small volume dose of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. With multiple doses of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we observed even greater reductions of Lp(a) of up to 99 percent with a mean reduction of 92 percent. Based on these results, Akcea started a Phase 2b dose-ranging study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a) and established CVD. Akcea completed enrollment in this study in January 2018 and expects to report data from this study in the second half of 2018.
 
AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx – AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is a LICA drug we designed to reduce the production of the angiopoietin-like 3, or ANGPTL3, protein. Akcea and we are developing AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx to treat multiple lipid disorders.
 
People with elevated levels of the angiopoietin-like 3, or ANGPTL3, protein have high LDL-C and triglyceride levels. Studies show this elevation is associated with an increased risk of premature heart attacks, increased arterial wall thickness, increased liver fat and multiple metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance. In contrast, people with lower levels of ANGPTL3 have lower LDL-C and triglyceride levels, and thus lower risk of heart attacks, lower prevalence of fatty liver and lower incidence of metabolic disorders. In preclinical studies, an analog of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx inhibited the production of the ANGPTL3 protein in the liver, resulting in lower liver fat accumulation and lower blood levels of LDL-C, triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or VLDL-C. In addition, our preclinical data and initial Phase 1 data suggest that inhibiting the production of ANGPTL3 could improve other lipid parameters, including triglyceride levels and total cholesterol, as well as metabolic parameters, such as insulin sensitivity.

We and Akcea have completed a Phase 1/2 program for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with elevated triglycerides. We and Akcea reported results for the initial cohort from this study at the AHA meeting in November 2016 and published the data in the New England Journal of Medicine. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we and Akcea initiated a study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, with metabolic complications, which include hypertriglyceridemia, type 2 diabetes or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. We expect data from this study in 2019. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we and Akcea initiated a study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with rare hyperlipidemias, including patients with FCS. If we and Akcea find that AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx can effectively lower triglyceride levels in patients with rare hyperlipidemias, including patients with FCS, through a different mechanism of action from volanesorsen, it may represent an opportunity to expand our FCS franchise. As part of our exploratory rare hyperlipidemia clinical program, we and Akcea are also studying AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with FPL and in patients with HoFH. Additional potential indications for which we may consider developing AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx include other rare hyperlipidemias and lipodystrophies.
 
AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx – is a LICA drug we designed to inhibit the production of apoC-III, the same protein inhibited by volanesorsen, for the broad population of people who are at risk for cardiometabolic disease due to their elevated triglyceride levels. Akcea and we initiated a collaboration with Novartis in January 2017 to advance AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx.
 
ApoC-III impacts triglyceride levels and may also increase inflammatory processes. This combination of effects makes apoC-III a promising target for people with LDL-C already controlled on statin therapy, but for whom triglycerides remain poorly controlled. We believe that the enhancements offered by our LICA technology can provide greater patient convenience by allowing for significantly lower doses and less frequent administration, compared to volanesorsen. We and Akcea conducted a Phase 1/2 study of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in people with elevated triglycerides and reported results from this study in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
Under our and Akcea’s collaboration with Novartis, we intend to complete the Phase 2 program required to define the appropriate dose and regimen to support a planned cardiovascular outcome study. We and Akcea initiated a Phase 2b dose-ranging study of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and established CVD in the first quarter of 2018 and plan to report data from this study in 2019.
 
Satellite Company Drugs in Development
 
We have successfully developed novel drugs we designed to treat many different diseases. In therapeutic areas that are outside of our core areas of development, we have licensed our drugs to highly focused satellite companies that have the specific expertise and resources to continue developing the drugs. For our satellite company drugs, we refer to the drug by the partner’s name or compound number, such as plazomicin or ATL1103. We have listed these drugs below in our Satellite Company pipeline.
IONIS’ Satellite Company Pipeline

* Named Patient Supply (see below).
 
Plazomicin – Plazomicin is an aminoglycoside drug that Achaogen is developing for the treatment of multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacterial infections. Aminoglycosides are a group of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis used to treat serious bacterial infections. In 2006, we licensed our proprietary aminoglycoside program to Achaogen. Achaogen discovered plazomicin based on technology licensed from us. Achaogen conducted two Phase 3 studies for plazomicin, CARE and EPIC. In December 2016, Achaogen announced that it completed two Phase 3 studies of plazomicin. The EPIC trial met its primary endpoint in patients with complicated urinary tract infections. The CARE trial demonstrated reduction in mortality in patients with serious multi-drug resistant infection due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE compared with colistin, one of the few remaining antibiotics for treatment of infections due to CRE. Plazomicin was well tolerated in both Phase 3 studies.
 
 17
 

Achaogen submitted an NDA to the FDA for plazomicin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including kidney infections and bloodstream infections due to certain Enterobacteriaceae in people who have limited to no alternative treatment options. FDA granted the NDA Priority Review and set a target action date under the PDUFA date of June 25, 2018. Achaogen plans to submit a MAA to the EMA in 2018.
 
The FDA has granted Fast Track Status for the development and regulatory review of plazomicin to treat serious and life-threatening CRE infections. In addition, plazomicin has received Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, designation from the FDA. The QIDP designation provides certain incentives for the development of new antibiotics, including priority review and an additional five years of market exclusivity.
 
Alicaforsen – Alicaforsen is an antisense drug we designed to reduce the production of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, or ICAM-1. Ulcerative colitis, or UC, is an inflammatory bowel disease of the colon, a part of the large intestine, and pouchitis is an inflammation of the surgically constructed internal pouch created in people with UC who have had their diseased colons removed. In 2007, we licensed alicaforsen to Atlantic Pharmaceuticals for pouchitis, UC and other inflammatory diseases. Atlantic Pharmaceuticals is developing alicaforsen for the treatment of UC and currently supplies alicaforsen in response to physicians' requests under international Named Patient Supply regulations for people with inflammatory bowel disease. In 2017, under a rolling submission agreement with the FDA, Atlantic Pharmaceuticals filed the nonclinical data package of its NDA for alicaforsen to treat pouchitis. Alicaforsen has also been granted FDA Fast-Track designation, plus U.S. and European Orphan Drug designations for this indication.
 
ATL1103 – ATL1103 is an antisense drug we designed to reduce the production of the growth hormone receptor, or GHr, to treat people with acromegaly. Acromegaly is a serious, chronic, life-threatening disease triggered by excess secretion of GHr by benign pituitary tumors. In 2001, we licensed ATL1103 to Antisense Therapeutics Limited, or ATL. ATL conducted a successful Phase II trial of ATL1103 with the trial having met its primary efficacy endpoint by showing a statistically significant average reduction in sIGF-1 levels. ATL has also completed a high dose study of ATL1103 in adults with acromegaly in Australia.
 
RG-012 – RG-012 is an anti-miR, or an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of microRNA, targeting microRNA-21, or miR-21, to treat people with Alport syndrome, a life-threatening genetic kidney disease with no approved therapy. While there is little known information on the progression of this disease, researchers believe that miR-21 plays a critical role due to the observed increased miR-21 levels in animal models of Alport syndrome and in people with chronic kidney disease. Regulus is developing RG-012 in a strategic alliance with Genzyme, a Sanofi company, to treat Alport syndrome. In September 2017, Regulus initiated HERA, the Phase 2 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of RG-012 in people with Alport syndrome.
 
RGLS4326 – RGLS4326 is an anti-miR, or an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of microRNA, designed to inhibit miR-17 to treat people with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, or ADPKD, using a unique chemistry design to preferentially target the kidney. ADPKD, caused by the mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes, is among the most common human monogenetic disorders and a leading genetic cause of end-stage renal disease. Approximately 1 in 1,000 people bear a mutation in either PKD1 or PKD2 genes worldwide. Preclinical studies with RGLS4326 have demonstrated a reduction in kidney cyst formation, improved kidney weight/body weight ratio, decreased cyst cell proliferation, and preserved kidney function in mouse models of ADPKD.
 
RGLS4326 is being studied in a Phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RGLS4326 administered subcutaneously in healthy volunteers.
 
ATL1102 – ATL1102 is an antisense drug we designed to reduce the production of CD49d, a sub-unit of Very Late Antigen-4, or VLA-4, for the treatment of people with multiple sclerosis, or MS. Results from preclinical studies demonstrated that inhibition of VLA-4 could positively affect a number of inflammatory diseases, including MS. In 2001, we licensed ATL1102 to ATL. ATL completed a chronic toxicology study in primates and a Phase 2a efficacy and safety trial. ATL1102 was shown by ATL to reduce MS lesions in the Phase 2a clinical trial and has also completed toxicology studies to support a potential future Phase 2b study in people with MS.
 
IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx – IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx is a Generation 2.5 antisense drug targeting dynamin 2 for the treatment of centronuclear myopathy, or CNM. CNM is a term for a group of rare, genetic, muscle disorders affecting children and young adults. These disorders are characterized by muscle weakness that can range from mild to profound. CNM, caused by mutations in the DNM2 gene, is highly variable in presentation and severity, presenting at birth, during childhood or in adulthood. When DNM2-related CNM occurs during infancy or early childhood, common symptoms include reduced muscle strength, generalized weakness, facial and eye muscle weakness and paralysis of muscles surrounding the eye. Affected children may exhibit delays in attaining motor milestones, such as holding their head up. Facial weakness can cause infants to have a weak sucking ability and/or experience difficulties swallowing, potentially resulting in feeding difficulties. Eventually, affected individuals can develop breathing complications, and sometimes infection of the lungs causes death in early infancy.
 
IONIS-DNM2-2.5Rx is currently in IND-enabling preclinical studies.
 
Antisense Technology
 
Our antisense technology is an innovative platform for discovering first-in-class or best-in-class drugs for treating disease. We believe this technology represents an important advance in the way we treat disease. Unlike most other drug technologies that work by affecting existing proteins in the body, antisense drugs target RNA, the intermediary that conveys genetic information from a gene to the protein synthesis machinery in the cell. By targeting RNA instead of proteins, we can use antisense technology to increase, decrease or alter the production of specific proteins. The unique properties of antisense technology provide several advantages over traditional drug discovery technologies.
 
 18
 

These advantages include:
 
 
● | Direct intervention in the disease process at the genetic level by targeting RNA: antisense technology represents a direct route from gene to drug. The explosion in genomic information and RNA biology has led to the discovery of many new disease-causing proteins and RNAs, and has created new opportunities that are only accessible to antisense technology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Precise specificity: we design antisense drugs to target a single RNA, which minimizes or eliminates the possibility our drugs will bind to unintended targets which can cause unwanted side effects.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Good drug properties: antisense drugs distribute well throughout the body without the need for special formulations or vehicles. They also have a relatively long half-life of approximately two to four weeks in most tissues outside of the brain and spinal cord and three to four months in brain and spinal cord, which means patients and/or healthcare providers can dose our drugs weekly, monthly or even less frequently depending on the drug and target tissue.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability to combine with other drugs: because antisense drugs do not interact with the enzymes that metabolize or break down other drugs, physicians can use our drugs in combination with other drugs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broad applications to multiple disease targets, multiple tissues and multiple mechanisms: there are virtually no “undruggable” targets with antisense technology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Efficient discovery and early development: because of the efficiency of our antisense technology, our drug discovery and early development costs and success rates compare favorably to small molecule or antibody drug discovery and development.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We develop antisense drugs to potentially treat a wide range of diseases in a number of different therapeutic areas from severe and rare diseases to diseases that affect large patient populations. We focus our efforts on diseases in which there is a large unmet medical need with limited or no current treatments or in diseases for which we believe our drugs have a competitive advantage over existing therapies.
 
Technology Overview
 
We use our core technology platform to discover and develop drugs that affect targets in the body at the genetic level. Genes contain the information necessary to produce proteins. A gene is made up of nucleotides containing the nucleoside bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, commonly known as A, T, G and C, which are linked together to form a two-stranded structure that resembles a twisted ladder, known as deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. The nucleotides on one side of the ladder bind weakly to complementary nucleotides on the other strand according to specific rules; for example, A pairs with T and G pairs with C, creating the ladder’s rungs (Figure 1). Scientists call this highly specific nucleotide pairing hybridization. The sequence or order of these nucleotides establishes the cell’s recipes for making proteins. Each protein’s instructions reside in a corresponding segment of DNA known as a gene.
 
Figure 1: Illustration of DNA.
  19
 

The instructions for making a protein are transcribed from a gene, or DNA into a different genetic molecule called messenger RNA. This process starts with the partial uncoiling of the two complementary strands of the DNA. One strand acts as a template and information stored in the DNA template strand is copied into a complementary RNA (Figure 2) by an enzyme called RNA polymerase, or RNAP. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, are mature, fully processed RNA that code for proteins.
 
Figure 2: Transcription of information contained in a gene, or DNA, to mRNA.
 
Ribosomes, the cell’s factories for manufacturing proteins, translate mRNA into proteins. The ribosome reads the encoded information, the mRNA’s nucleotide sequence, and in doing so, strings together amino acids to form a specific protein (Figure 3).
 
Figure 3: Translation of the protein-coding information contained in mRNA to protein.
 
We primarily use our antisense technology to interrupt the cell’s protein production process by preventing the mRNA instructions from reaching the ribosome, thus inhibiting the production of the protein. We can also design antisense drugs to increase protein production for diseases caused by the lack of a particular protein or modify the processing (or splicing) of the mRNA, which can alter the composition of the protein. The mRNA sequence of nucleotides that carries the information for protein production is called the ‘sense’ strand. Scientists call the complementary nucleotide chain that binds specifically to the sense strand the “antisense” strand. We use the information contained in mRNA to design chemical structures, that we call antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs, or antisense drugs, which resemble DNA and RNA and are the complement of RNA. Our antisense drugs bind with high selectivity to the mRNA they were designed to target. Since each mRNA codes for a specific protein, this selectivity provides a level of specificity that is better than traditional drugs. As a result, we can design antisense drugs that selectively inhibit the disease-causing member of a protein family without interfering with other members of the protein family that might be necessary for normal cellular or bodily functions. This unique specificity means that antisense drugs may be less toxic than traditional drugs because we can design them to minimize the impact on unintended targets.

We have developed the majority of the drugs in our pipeline using our advanced screens to produce drugs with what we believe have the best possible safety and tolerability profiles. We refer to our drugs that have passed these advanced screens as Generation 2+ drugs. We continue to advance our antisense technology to create even more potent drugs that we can use in more tissues and against more targets. These advances allow us to expand the mechanisms through which we can use our drugs. These advancements provide us with greater opportunities to use our antisense drugs to treat a greater number of diseases and reach more patient populations. Today several of our early stage drugs and those entering our pipeline use our most advanced antisense technology, including our next generation chemistries, Generation 2.5, and our LICA technology.
 
Generation 2.5 chemistry is an Ionis advancement that we have demonstrated increases the potency of our drugs by up to ten-fold over our Generation 2+ drugs. This increase in potency enables our drugs to engage targets in a broader array of tissues. We have published data demonstrating that our Generation 2.5 drugs generally have enhanced potency over our Generation 2+ drugs and are broadly distributed throughout the body to multiple tissues including liver, kidney, lung, muscle, adipose, adrenal gland, peripheral nerves and tumor tissues. Our Generation 2.5 drugs constitute some of our recently added new drugs to our pipeline.
 
LICA (LIgand-Conjugated Antisense) is a chemical technology we developed at Ionis that involves the attachment of a molecule called a ligand that binds with receptors on the surfaces of cells in a highly specific manner. Because these receptors are often found only on certain cell types, LICA allows us to increase effective delivery of our antisense drugs with higher specificity to certain cell types that express these receptors relative to non-conjugated antisense drugs. We have demonstrated with multiple Generation 2+ LICA drugs that our LICA technology for liver targets can increase potency by up to more than thirty-fold over our non-LICA Generation 2+ drugs. We have also combined our LICA technology with our Generation 2.5 chemistry drugs to further increase potency. Although we designed our first LICA drugs to inhibit targets in the liver, we are also developing LICA conjugation technology that we can use to target other tissues and initial results are promising.
Antisense Targets and Mechanisms
 
There are more than a dozen different antisense mechanisms that we can exploit with our antisense technology. The majority of the drugs in our pipeline bind to mRNAs and inhibit the production of disease-causing proteins. However, our antisense technology is broadly applicable to many different antisense mechanisms, including modulation of RNA splicing, RNA interference, or RNAi, and enhancing protein translation to increase protein production. We have also recently published research showing that we can use our proprietary oligonucleotide technology with CRISPR/Cas9, a gene editing system that uses RNA to activate, target and edit specific sites on DNA. Our work in this area provides an important step toward development of potential therapeutic applications for CRISPR technology.
 
 When using antisense technology to inhibit the production of disease-causing proteins or reduce levels of harmful RNAs, our antisense drugs bind to the target RNA via highly specific nucleotide pairing, or hybridization, and recruit a cellular enzyme called ribonuclease H1, or RNase H1, to degrade the target RNA. The antisense drug itself remains intact during this process, so it can remain active against additional target RNA molecules and repeatedly trigger their degradation (Figure 4). Examples of our clinical development stage antisense drugs that use the RNase H1 mechanism to reduce disease protein production include, volanesorsen, inotersen, IONIS-FXIRx, IONIS-FXI-LRx, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, IONIS-HTTRx, and others.
 
Figure 4: Antisense drug using the RNase H mechanism of action.

SPINRAZA is an example of an antisense drug that modulates RNA splicing to increase protein production of the SMN protein (Figure 5), which is critical to the health and survival of nerve cells in the spinal cord that are responsible for neuro-muscular function. The SMN protein is deficient in people with SMA. There are a number of other diseases, including cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which may be treated by modulating splicing using antisense technology.
 
Figure 5: Antisense drug altering splicing of the SMN2 mRNA.
 
Another class of RNA targets for our antisense technology are microRNAs. To date, scientists have identified more than 700 microRNAs in the human genome, and have shown that the absence or presence of specific microRNAs in various cells is associated with specific human diseases, including cancer, viral infection, metabolic disorders and inflammatory disease. To fully exploit the therapeutic opportunities of targeting microRNAs, we co-founded Regulus Therapeutics as a company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of microRNA-based therapeutics.
 
We are also making progress in designing antisense drugs to target long, non-coding RNAs, or lncRNAs and RNAs that possess a toxic function in human diseases. Many of these RNAs, such as lncRNAs, do not make proteins but often cause disease by regulating the function of other genes or proteins. In 2014, we published a paper in Nature in which we were the first to show that targeted reduction of an lncRNA with an antisense compound can ameliorate certain cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome, or AS. Moreover, these studies demonstrate the potential therapeutic benefits of an antisense drugs for the treatment of AS.
 
Because the efficiency of our core technology platform can support multiple target-based antisense research programs without significantly increasing costs, we can develop antisense drugs to target a broad range of diseases, efficiently producing a large and broad proprietary portfolio of drugs. We are currently pursuing antisense drug discovery programs focused on various severe and rare diseases, cardiometabolic diseases, neurologic diseases, cancer and other diseases.
 
Collaborative Arrangements and Licensing Agreements
  
Partnering Strategy

 
We have established alliances with a cadre of leading global pharmaceutical companies that are working alongside us in developing our drugs, advancing our technology, preparing to commercialize our drugs and selling our drugs. Our partners include the following companies, among others: AstraZeneca, Biogen, Bayer, GSK, Janssen, Novartis and Roche. Our partners bring resources and expertise that augment and build upon our internal capabilities. The depth of our knowledge and expertise with antisense technology together with our strong financial position provides us the flexibility to partner our drugs at what we believe is the optimal time to maximize the near- and long-term value of our drugs. We have distinct partnering strategies that we employ based on the specific program, therapeutic area and the expertise and resources our potential partners may bring to the collaboration.

● | We have strategic partnerships through which we can broadly expand our drug discovery efforts to new disease targets in specific therapeutic areas. Our partners provide expertise, tools and resources to complement our drug discovery efforts. For instance, we established a broad strategic alliance with Biogen that pairs Biogen’s extensive resources and expertise in neurodegenerative diseases with our antisense technology. Together we are creating a franchise of novel drugs for neurodegenerative diseases that has the potential to expand both our pipeline and Biogen’s pipeline with promising new drugs. Most recently, we entered into a new collaboration agreement with Biogen to identify new antisense drugs for the treatment of SMA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have partnerships with companies that bring significant expertise and global resources to develop and potentially commercialize drugs for a particular therapeutic area. For example, in January 2017, we and Akcea initiated a collaboration with Novartis to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. As a leader in the cardiovascular disease space, Novartis brings significant resources and expertise that should support the development and commercialization of these two drugs for significant high-risk patient populations. The collaboration with Novartis should enable us to accelerate the development of these drugs for broader patient populations as Novartis plans to conduct a cardiovascular outcome study for each of these drugs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | We also form early stage research and development partnerships that allow us to expand the application of our technology to new therapeutic areas. For example, we established a collaboration with Janssen in December 2014, which brings together our RNA-targeted technology platform and Janssen’s expertise in autoimmune disorders and therapeutic formulation to discover and develop antisense drugs to treat autoimmune disorders in the GI tract. Thus far, Janssen has licensed two drugs under our collaboration.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We also work with a consortium of companies that can exploit our drugs and technologies outside our primary areas of focus. We refer to these companies as satellite companies. Through our satellite company collaborations, we expand the reach and potential of RNA-targeting therapeutics into disease areas that are outside of our core focus. For example, in October 2017, Achaogen submitted an NDA to the FDA for plazomicin. Plazomicin is an aminoglycoside Achaogen discovered based on the technology we licensed to Achaogen and we are eligible to earn milestone payments and royalties under our licensing agreement.

Financial Impact of Our Partnerships
 
Through our partnerships, we have created a broad and sustaining base of R&D revenue in the form of license fees, upfront payments and milestone payments while spending prudently to advance our pipeline and technology. Since 2007, we have received more than $2.4 billion in cash from upfront and licensing fees, equity purchase payments, milestone payments and research and development funding from our partnerships. We have the potential to earn over $13 billion in future milestone payments, licensing fees and other payments from our current partnerships. We also have the potential to share in the future commercial success of our inventions and drugs resulting from our partnerships through royalty arrangements. For example, during 2017 we earned $112.5 million in commercial revenue from SPINRAZA sales, adding a significant revenue stream to our broad base of R&D revenue.
Strategic Partnerships
 
AstraZeneca
 
Cardiometabolic and Renal Diseases Collaboration
 
 In July 2015, we and AstraZeneca formed a strategic collaboration to discover and develop antisense therapies for treating cardiovascular and metabolic diseases primarily focused on targets in the kidney, and renal diseases. As part of the agreement, we granted AstraZeneca an exclusive license to IONIS-AZ4-2.5-LRx, a drug we designed to treat cardiovascular disease and our first drug that combines our Generation 2.5 and LICA technology. We also granted AstraZeneca the option to license a drug for each additional target advanced under this research collaboration. In February 2018, AstraZeneca licensed a second drug under our collaboration, IONIS-AZ5-2.5Rx, a drug we designed to treat a genetically associated form of kidney disease. AstraZeneca is responsible for all further global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for IONIS-AZ4-2.5-LRx and IONIS-AZ5-2.5Rx and any other future drug development candidates AstraZeneca accepts.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, we received a $65 million upfront payment. We are eligible to receive license fees and milestone payments of up to more than $4 billion as drugs under this collaboration advance. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties up to the low teens on sales from any product that AstraZeneca successfully commercializes under this collaboration agreement. From inception through February 2018, we have generated over $120 million in payments under this collaboration, including $30 million when AstraZeneca licensed IONIS-AZ5-2.5Rx in February 2018.
 
Oncology Collaboration
 
In December 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to discover and develop antisense drugs to treat cancer. As part of the agreement, we granted AstraZeneca an exclusive license to develop and commercialize IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx for the treatment of cancer and an option to license up to three anti-cancer drugs under separate research programs. AstraZeneca is responsible for all global development, regulatory and commercialization activities for IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx. We and AstraZeneca have evaluated IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx in people with advanced metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced lymphoma. AstraZeneca is evaluating IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx in combination with Imfinzi (durvalumab), AstraZeneca’s anti-PD-L1 drug, in people with head and neck cancer and in people with diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Under the research program, we are responsible for identifying a development candidate for each of the three anti-cancer research programs. AstraZeneca has the option to license drugs resulting from each of the three anti-cancer research programs, and if AstraZeneca exercises its option for a drug, it will be responsible for all further global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for such drug. The first development candidate identified under the anti-cancer research program was IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx, which AstraZeneca licensed from us in December 2016. IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx is a Generation 2.5 antisense drug we designed to directly target KRAS, one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, we received $31 million in upfront payments. We are eligible to receive milestone payments and license fees from AstraZeneca as programs advance in development. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties up to the low to mid-teens on sales from any drugs resulting from these programs. If AstraZeneca successfully develops IONIS-STAT3-2.5Rx, IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx and two other drugs under the research program, we could receive license fees and milestone payments of up to more than $750 million. From inception through February 2018, we have generated more than $95 million in payments under this collaboration.
 
For additional details about our collaboration agreements with AstraZeneca, including other financial information and termination provisions, see Note 6, Collaborative Arrangements and Licensing Agreements, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Biogen
 
We have several strategic collaborations with Biogen focused on using antisense technology to advance the treatment of neurological disorders. These collaborations combine our expertise in creating antisense drugs with Biogen's expertise in developing therapies for neurological disorders. We developed and licensed to Biogen SPINRAZA, our approved drug to treat people with SMA. Additionally, we and Biogen are currently developing six other drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases under these collaborations, including IONIS-SOD1Rx for ALS, IONIS-MAPTRx (formerly IONIS-BIIB4Rx) for AD and IONIS-C9Rx (formerly IONIS-BIIB5Rx) for ALS, IONIS-BIIB6Rx, IONIS-BIIB7Rx and IONIS-BIIB8Rx to treat undisclosed neurodegenerative diseases. In addition to these drugs, we and Biogen are evaluating numerous additional targets to develop drugs to treat neurological diseases. Most recently, in December 2017 we entered into a collaboration with Biogen to identify new antisense drugs for the treatment of SMA. From inception through February 2018, we have generated over $810 million from our Biogen collaborations.
SPINRAZA
 
In January 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Biogen to develop and commercialize SPINRAZA, an RNA-targeted therapy for the treatment of SMA. In December 2016, the FDA approved SPINRAZA for the treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult patients. In January 2018, Biogen reported that SPINRAZA was available in over 30 markets. Through December 2017, we have earned $113.4 million in commercial revenue from SPINRAZA royalties. In addition to SPINRAZA royalties, from inception through February 2018, we have generated over $435 million in payments for SPINRAZA, including $90 million of milestone payments for the approval of SPINRAZA in the EU and Japan during 2017. We are receiving tiered royalties up to the mid-teens on any sales of SPINRAZA. We have exclusively in-licensed patents related to SPINRAZA from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the University of Massachusetts. We paid Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the University of Massachusetts nominal amounts for license fees and milestone payments we received in 2017. We also pay a low single digit royalty on sales of SPINRAZA. Additionally, we owe a low single digit royalty on future sales of SPINRAZA. Biogen is responsible for all further global development, regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for SPINRAZA.

We received additional equity and convertible notes in Dynacure for the license of IONIS-DMN2-2.5Rx in 2017. We recorded a full valuation allowance for all of the equity and convertible debt we received from Dynacure because realization of value from the equity is uncertain. If Dynacure advances a target under this collaboration, we could receive cash or equity up to more than $210 million in a license fee and milestone payments for specified development, regulatory and sales events. In addition, we are eligible to receive royalties on future product sales of the drug under this collaboration.


 Regulus Therapeutics Inc.
 
 In September 2007, we and Alnylam established Regulus as a company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of microRNA-targeting therapeutics. We and Alnylam retain rights to develop and commercialize, on pre-negotiated terms, microRNA therapeutic products that Regulus decides not to develop either by itself or with a partner. Regulus is addressing therapeutic opportunities that arise from alterations in microRNA expression. Since microRNAs may act as master regulators of the genome, affecting the expression of multiple genes in a disease pathway, microRNA therapeutics define a new platform for drug discovery and development. MicroRNAs may also prove to be an attractive new tool for characterizing diseases. Regulus’ focus is on drug discovery and development efforts for diseases with significant unmet medical need in organs to which we have been able to preferentially deliver oligonucleotide therapeutics effectively, such as the liver and kidney. Regulus currently has two drugs in clinical development. Regulus is studying RGLS4326 in a Phase 1 single ascending dose study designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RGLS4326 administered subcutaneously in healthy volunteers. We are eligible to receive royalties on any future product sales of these drugs.

For additional details about our external project funding collaborations, see Note 6, Collaborative Arrangements and Licensing Agreements, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Intellectual Property Sale and Licensing Agreements
  
We have a broad patent portfolio covering our products and technologies. We believe our patent estate represents the largest and most valuable nucleic acid therapeutics-oriented patent estate in the pharmaceutical industry. While the principal purpose of our intellectual property portfolio is to protect our products and those of our partners described above, our intellectual property is a strategic asset that we are exploiting to generate near-term revenues and that we expect will also provide us with revenue in the future. We have an active intellectual property sales and licensing program in which we sell or license aspects of our intellectual property to companies. Through this program, we also license our non-antisense patents. To date, we have generated more than $510 million from our intellectual property sale and licensing program that helps support our internal drug discovery and development programs.
 
 In-Licensing Arrangements

We paid Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory nominal amounts for license fees and milestone payments we received in 2017 and a low single digit royalty on sales of SPINRAZA. Additionally, we owe a low single digit royalty on future sales of SPINRAZA.


For additional details about our Intellectual Property Sale and Licensing arrangements, see Note 6, Collaborative Arrangements and Licensing Agreements, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Manufacturing
 
In the past, except for small quantities, it was generally expensive and difficult to produce chemically modified oligonucleotides like the antisense drugs we use in our research and development programs. As a result, we have dedicated significant resources to develop ways to improve manufacturing efficiency and capacity. Since we can use variants of the same nucleotide building blocks and the same type of equipment to produce our oligonucleotide drugs, we found that the same techniques we used to efficiently manufacture one oligonucleotide drug could help improve the manufacturing processes for many other oligonucleotide drugs. By developing several proprietary chemical processes to scale up our manufacturing capabilities, we have greatly reduced the cost of producing oligonucleotide drugs. For example, we have significantly reduced the cost of raw materials through improved yield efficiency, while at the same time increasing our capacity to make the drugs. Through both our internal research and development programs and collaborations with outside vendors we may achieve even greater efficiency and further cost reductions.
 
 28
 

Our drug substance manufacturing facility is located in a 28,700 square foot building in Carlsbad, California. We purchased this building in 2017. In addition, we have a 25,800 square foot building that houses support functions for our manufacturing activities. We lease this facility under a lease that has an initial term ending in June 2021 with an option to extend the lease for up to two additional five-year periods. Our manufacturing facility is subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to ensure that it is operating in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements.
 
As part of our collaborations we may agree to manufacture clinical trial materials and/or commercial supply for our partners. For example, in the past we have manufactured clinical supply materials for AstraZeneca, Bayer, Biogen, GSK and Novartis. We believe that with reasonably anticipated benefits from increases in scale and improvements in chemistry, we can manufacture antisense drugs at commercially competitive prices.
 
We believe we have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our current internal research, development and potential commercial needs, including the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial we have for volanesorsen, as well as our current and future obligations under existing agreements with our partners for research, development and commercial needs. Specifically, we have the following in place for our approved drug, SPINRAZA and our drugs currently under regulatory review, volanesorsen and inotersen:
 
SPINRAZA
 
 Pursuant to our collaboration with Biogen, Biogen is responsible for SPINRAZA drug supply. Biogen has contracted with us to manufacture API for SPINRAZA through September 2018.
 
Volanesorsen
 
We have supplied Akcea either through our manufacturing processes or through our outside vendors, including API and finished drug product to complete its ongoing clinical study for volanesorsen. We have also supplied the API and the finished drug product for volanesorsen’s launch. We believe the API and drug product is adequate for at least the first two years of volanesorsen’s launch. Akcea plans to leverage our relationships with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMO's, to procure its own long-term raw material and drug supplies at competitive prices in the future.
Inotersen
 
For inotersen’s commercial launch, we are using CMOs to produce custom raw materials, API and finished goods. Our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise and cGMP experience. We believe our current network of CMO partners are capable of providing sufficient quantities to meet anticipated commercial demands. Additionally, we continue to evaluate further relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity as well as reduce further risks. While we believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our commercial requirements, we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. We also cannot provide assurance that we will not experience a disruption in supply from our current CMO partners.
 
CMOs are subject to the FDA’s cGMP requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our CMO partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.
 
We have manufactured limited supplies of our LICA drugs for our preclinical and clinical studies. We have purchased additional supplies of our LICA drugs through a CMO. LICA enables lower doses than unconjugated oligonucleotides. With our expertise in optimizing manufacturing of oligonucleotides, we believe we can develop new processes to scale up manufacturing of our LICA drugs at commercially competitive prices.
 
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products in the United States and other countries. We own or have exclusively licensed a substantial patent estate with numerous issued patents worldwide protecting our products and, more generally, our platform for development and commercialization of oligonucleotide therapeutics. We focus our resources on patents and new patent applications that drive value for our company.
 
We own or control patents that provide exclusivity for products in our pipeline and patents that provide exclusivity for our core technology in the field of antisense more generally. Our core technology patents include claims to chemically modified nucleosides and oligonucleotides as well as antisense drug designs utilizing these chemically modified nucleosides. These core claims are each independent of specific therapeutic target, nucleic acid sequence, or clinical indication. We also own a large number of patents claiming antisense compounds having nucleic acid sequences complementary to therapeutic target nucleic acids, independent of the particular chemical modifications incorporated into the antisense compound. Most importantly, we seek and obtain issued patent claims to specifically protect each of our drugs. For example, we file and seek to obtain claims covering each drug’s nucleic acid sequence and precise drug design. In sum, we maintain our competitive advantage in the field of antisense technology by protecting our core platform technology, which applies to most of our drugs, and by creating multiple layers of patent protection for each of our specific drugs in development.

Chemically Modified Nucleosides and Oligonucleotides
 
The most broadly applicable of our patents are those that claim modified nucleosides and oligonucleotides comprising the modified nucleosides that we incorporate into our antisense drugs to increase their therapeutic efficacy. Nucleosides and chemically modified nucleosides are the basic building blocks of our antisense drugs, therefore claims that cover any oligonucleotide incorporating one of our proprietary modified nucleosides can apply to a wide array of antisense mechanisms of action as well as several therapeutic targets. Of particular note are our patents covering our proprietary 2’-O-(2-methoxy) ethyl, or “MOE,” modified nucleosides, incorporated into many of our second generation development compounds, as well as our constrained-ethyl nucleosides, or “cEt” nucleosides incorporated into our Generation 2.5 compounds. 
 
The following are some of our patents in this category in key jurisdictions (U.S., Europe and Japan):
 

Jurisdiction | Patent No. | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims 
--------------+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
United States | 7,101,993 | OLIGONUCLEOTIDES CONTAINING 2’O-MODIFIED PURINES | 2023 | Covers certain MOE nucleosides and oligonucleotides containing these nucleotides. 
United States | 7,399,845 | 6-MODIFIED BICYCLIC NUCLEIC ACID ANALOGS | 2027 | Covers our cEt nucleosides and oligonucleotides containing these nucleoside analogs.

Japan | JP5342881 | 6-MODIFIED BICYCLIC NUCLEIC ACID ANALOGS | 2027 | Covers our cEt nucleosides and oligonucleotides containing these nucleoside analogs.

Antisense Drug Design Motifs
 
Other of our patents claim oligonucleotides comprising antisense drug design motifs, or patterns of nucleoside modifications at specified positions in the oligonucleotide. Patent claims covering our antisense drug design motifs are independent of nucleic acid sequence, so they cover oligonucleotides having the recited motif, regardless of cellular target or clinical indication. The claimed motifs generally confer properties that optimize oligonucleotides for a particular antisense mechanism of action, such as ribonuclease H, or RNase H, RNAi, or splicing. We have designed oligonucleotides incorporating motifs, which we refer to as chimeric compounds or gapmers to exploit the RNase H mechanism to achieve target RNA reduction. Almost all of our drugs, including volanesorsen and inotersen, but excluding SPINRAZA, contain this gapmer antisense drug design motif. We own a U.S. patent that covers all of our second generation MOE gapmer antisense drugs until March of 2023.
 
In addition, we have pursued patent claims to antisense drug design motifs incorporating bicyclic nucleoside analogs, which include both locked nucleic acids, or “LNA” and cEt. In Europe, we have been granted claims drawn to certain short gapmer oligonucleotides with bicyclic nucleosides, which include locked nucleic acids, in the wings for the treatment of cardiovascular or metabolic disorders. We have also successfully obtained issued patent claims covering our Generation 2.5 gapmer antisense drug design motifs that incorporate our cEt modified nucleosides. Santaris opposed granted European patents EP2092065 and EP2410053. In April 2015, the claims of EP2092065 were successfully upheld in amended form and in January 2017, EP2410053 was upheld with only minor amendment. The following patents are some examples of our issued patents in this category in key jurisdictions:
 

Jurisdiction | Patent/ Application No. | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims

LIgand-Conjugated Antisense (LICA) Technology
 
We have also pursued patent claims to new chemistries created to enhance targeting of antisense drugs to specific tissues and cells in order to improve a drug’s properties. Our N-acetyl-galactosamine, or GalNAc, LICA drugs are designed to provide an increase in potency for targets in the liver. We have successfully obtained issued patent claims covering our LICA technology conjugated to any modified oligonucleotide, including gapmers, double-stranded siRNA compounds, and fully modified oligonucleotides. The following patents are some examples of our issued patents in this category:
 

Jurisdiction | Patent/ Application No. | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims 
--------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
United States | 9,127,276 | CONJUGATED ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE | 2034 | Covers our primary THA LICA conjugated to any group of nucleosides, including gapmers, double-stranded siRNA compounds, and fully modified oligonucleotides 
United States | 9,181,549 | CONJUGATED ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE | 2034 | Covers our primary THA conjugate having our preferred linker and cleavable moiety conjugated to any oligomeric compound or any nucleoside having a 2’-MOE modification or a cEt modification

Therapeutic Methods of Treatment and Antisense Drug Sequences
 
In addition to our broad core patents, we also own hundreds of patents, worldwide, with claims to antisense compounds having particular sequences and compounds directed to particular therapeutically important targets or methods of achieving clinical endpoints using these antisense compounds. These “Target” patents also include claims reciting the specific nucleic acid sequences utilized by our products, independent of chemical modifications and motifs. In addition, our product specific patents typically include claims combining specific nucleic acid sequences with nucleoside modifications and motifs. In this way, we seek patent claims narrowly tailored to protect our products specifically, in addition to the broader core antisense patents described above.
 
 Survival Motor Neuron and SPINRAZA
 
SPINRAZA is protected from generic competition in the United States until at least 2030 and in Europe until 2026 by a suite of patents. These issued patents include: (i) the Bennett patent related to methods of altering mRNA processing (e.g., splicing, the mechanism of action of SPINRAZA) with a fully modified 2’MOE oligonucleotide, (ii) a patent licensed from the University of Massachusetts drawn to antisense compounds having the sequence of SPINRAZA, independent of chemical modification and uses of such compounds for treating SMA, and (iii) joint patents with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory claiming fully modified 2’MOE compositions targeting SMN2, including the precise composition of matter of SPINRAZA and methods of using such compositions. Those patents protect SPINRAZA from generic and antisense innovator competition in the United States until at least 2030. We have filed for patent term extension, to potentially extend the term beyond 2030. With Biogen’s license of SPINRAZA, we assigned our interest in these patents to Biogen. The table below lists the key U.S. and European issued patents protecting SPINRAZA:

Apolipoprotein C-III and volanesorsen
 
We have obtained patent claims in the United States drawn to the use of antisense compounds complementary to a broad active region of human Apo C-III, including the site targeted by volanesorsen. We have secured similar claims to compounds complementary to any site on human Apo C-III in Australia. We have also obtained issued patent claims to the specific antisense sequence and chemical composition of volanesorsen in the United States, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and Europe. The issued U.S. claims protect volanesorsen from generic competition in the United States until at least 2023. In addition, upon approval of volanesorsen by the FDA, we will seek patent term extension to recapture a portion of the term lost during FDA regulatory review, extending the term of this patent beyond 2023. We are pursuing additional patent applications designed to protect volanesorsen worldwide. The table below lists the issued patents in key jurisdictions:
 

Jurisdiction | Patent No. | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims 
--------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
United States | 9,624,496 | MODULATION OF APOLIPOPROTEIN C-III EXPRESSION | 2023 | Antisense compound specifically hybridizable within the nucleotide region of apoCIII targeted by volanesorsen

Transthyretin and inotersen
 
We obtained issued claims covering inotersen in the United States. The issued U.S. claims protect inotersen from generic competition in the United States until at least 2031. We are also pursuing additional patent applications designed to protect inotersen in foreign jurisdictions. The table below lists the current issued patents protecting inotersen in key jurisdictions:
 

Jurisdiction | Patent No. | Title | Expiration | Description of Claims 
--------------+------------+----------------------------------------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
United States | 8,101,743 | MODULATION OF TRANSTHYRETIN EXPRESSION | 2025 | Antisense sequence and chemistry of inotersen 
United States | 8,697,860 | DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE | 2031 | Composition of inotersen

Europe | EP2563920 | MODULATION OF TRANSTHYRETIN EXPRESSION | 2031 | Composition of inotersen 

 
We seek patent protection in significant markets and/or countries for each drug in development. We also seek to maximize patent term. In some cases, the patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during FDA regulatory review. The patent exclusivity period for a drug will prevent generic drugs from entering the market. Patent exclusivity depends on a number of factors including initial patent term and available patent term extensions based upon delays caused by the regulatory approval process.
 
Manufacturing Patents
 
We also own patents claiming methods of manufacturing and purifying oligonucleotides. These patents claim methods for improving oligonucleotide drug manufacturing, including processes for large-scale oligonucleotide synthesis and purification. These methods allow us to manufacture oligonucleotides at lower cost by, for example, eliminating expensive manufacturing steps.
 
We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in antisense therapeutics.

Government Regulation
 
Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant component in the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and services. In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and relevant foreign regulatory authorities, we are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state and local regulations.
 
Extensive regulation by United States and foreign governmental authorities governs the development, manufacture and sale of our drugs. In particular, our drugs are subject to a number of approval requirements by the FDA in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other laws and by comparable agencies in those foreign countries in which we conduct business. The FDCA and other various federal, state and foreign statutes govern or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, quality, and import and export of our drugs. State, local, and other authorities also regulate pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities and procedures.
 
 Our manufacturing facility and our CMOs are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other foreign equivalents to ensure that they are operating in compliance with cGMP requirements. In addition, marketing authorization for each new drug may require a rigorous manufacturing pre-approval inspection by regulatory authorities. Post approval, there are strict regulations regarding changes to the manufacturing process, and, depending on the significance of the change, changes may require prior FDA approval. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use.
 
The FDA must approve any new unapproved drug before a manufacturer can market it in the United States. In order to obtain approval, we and our partners must complete clinical studies and prepare and submit an NDA to the FDA. If the FDA approves a drug, it will issue an approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the drug and may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. The requirements for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of our drugs. In foreign jurisdictions, the drug approval process is similarly demanding.
 
Numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and similar foreign, state and local government authorities, regulate sales, promotion and other activities following drug approval. Only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that the FDA has approved may be used in labeling. Promotional communications regarding a drug must be consistent with the information in the drug’s approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.
 
For any approved drug, domestic and foreign sales of the drug depend, in part, on the availability and amount of reimbursement by third party payors, including governments and private health plans. Private health plans may seek to manage cost and use of our drugs by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. Governments may also regulate or influence coverage, reimbursement and/or pricing of our drugs to control cost or affect use. Within the EU a variety of payors pay for drugs, with governments being the primary source of payment. Negotiating pricing with governmental authorities can delay commercialization. Such pricing and reimbursement factors could impact our ability and that of our commercial partners, including Akcea, to successfully commercialize approved drugs.
 
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels and by foreign governments that seek to reduce healthcare costs. There has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in efforts to bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
 
Other healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; analogous state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect; and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 
Our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, distributors, or other business partners, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. These laws may impact, among other things, our commercialization partners’ proposed sales, marketing and education programs.
 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits certain individuals and entities, including us, from promising, paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, directly or indirectly, to obtain or retain business or an improper advantage. If we violate the FCPA, it could result in large civil and criminal penalties as well as an adverse effect on our reputation, operations, and financial condition. We could also face collateral consequences such as debarment and the loss of export privileges.

Competition

Our Business in General
 
Some of our drugs may compete with existing therapies for market share. In addition, there are a number of companies pursuing the development of oligonucleotide-based technologies and the development of pharmaceuticals utilizing these technologies. These companies include specialized pharmaceutical firms and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together with biopharmaceutical companies. Our drugs are differentiated from traditional small molecule drugs by their chemistry, how they move in the body, how they act in the body, delivery technology, and formulations.
 
Our approved products and our products under development address numerous markets. The diseases our drugs target for which we have or may receive marketing authorization will determine our competition. For some of our products, an important factor in competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical trials and marketing authorization processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market are important competitive factors. We expect to compete among products approved for sale based on a variety of factors, including, among other things, product efficacy, safety, mechanism of action, dosing convenience, marketing and sales strategy and tactics, availability, price, and reimbursement.
 
The current key competition for SPINRAZA, our marketed drug for the treatment of people with SMA, and volanesorsen and inotersen, our drugs currently under regulatory review for the treatment of people with FCS and hATTR, respectively, is set forth below.
 
SPINRAZA
 
We believe that the following drugs could compete with SPINRAZA:
 

Drug | Company | Drug Description | Phase | Admin/Dosing | Efficacy(1) | Safety(1) 
---------+-----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+--------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AVXS-101 | AveXis | Gene therapy that corrects the SMN1 gene using the AAV9 Vector | Pivotal | Infusion | As of January 20, 2017, in the Phase 1 OLE, the 12 patients taking the proposed therapeutic dose of AVXS-101 were event free and were a median age of 20.2 months at their last follow up appointment. Additionally, 10 out of the 12 patients achieved the ability to sit unassisted for at least 5 seconds, including one patient whose achievement of this milestone was confirmed after January 20, 2017. | Generally well tolerated to date, no new treatment-related SAEs or AEs observed 
RG7916 | PTC Therapeutics/ Roche/ SMA Foundation | A small molecule drug that modulates splicing of the SMN2 gene | 2 | Oral | None reported | Safe and well tolerated at all doses and had no drug-related or safety-related study withdrawals. 
LMI070 | Novartis | A small molecule drug that modulates splicing of the SMN2 gene | 1/2 | Oral | None reported | Study was placed on clinical hold in May 2016 due to safety findings reported in animal studies. The clinical hold was removed in September 2017 and dosing resumed along with additional monitoring.


(1) | Taken from public documents including respective company press releases, company presentations, and scientific presentations.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We believe that SPINRAZA’s closest competitor is AVXS-101. AVXS-101 is currently in a pivotal study for infants with Type 1 SMA using natural history as a comparator. Avexis initiated this study in September 2017 and plans to enroll 15 patients. AveXis has incorporated EU specific Scientific Advice from the EMA into its European pivotal study. While the data released thus far on the AVXS-101 study is encouraging, it is still early in development, having just initiated its first of two pivotal studies. In addition, other gene therapies have had difficulty providing lasting therapeutic benefit. Also AveXis has stated it needs to scale its manufacturing capabilities to be able to manufacture larger quantities of AVXS-101 GMP drug for their pivotal studies in Type 1, ongoing Phase 1 studies in Type 2 patients, and future studies in patients with Type 3 SMA. Further, no company has yet to successfully commercialize a gene replacement therapy, which may create significant barriers for AVXS-101.
 
 34
 

Volanesorsen
 
We believe that the following drugs could compete with volanesorsen:
 

Drug | Company | Drug Description | Phase | Admin/Dosing | Efficacy(1) | Safety(1) 
------------+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+-------+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Metreleptin | Novelion Therapeutics | A synthetic form of the hormone leptin | 3 | Reconstituted subcutaneous injection | 44.4% mean reduction in triglycerides at four months in patients with abnormal triglyceride levels | Anti-metreleptin antibodies, hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity, risk of T-cell lymphoma 
Gemcabene | Gemphire Therapeutics | Monocalcium salt of a dialkyl ether dicarboxylic acid | 2 | Oral, once-daily | In a post hoc analysis (n=9) of patients with triglycerides >500 mg/dl, reductions of 59% and 60% from 150mg and 300mg doses, respectively, were observed | In a recent study, in the gemcabene-treatment group, the most frequently occurring adverse events were headache and infection


(1) | Taken from public documents including respective company press releases, company presentations, and scientific presentations.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Metreleptin is being tested in people with FPL who also have NASH. In December 2016, Novelion submitted a marketing authorization application to the EMA seeking approval for Metreleptin as replacement therapy to treat complications of leptin deficiency in a small subset of people with FPL and in people with generalized lipodystrophy, or GL. An investigator-sponsored study is currently ongoing with the support of Novelion to evaluate Metreleptin in people with FPL who also have NASH. Metreleptin does not affect apoC-III levels. ApoC-III levels have been shown to be elevated in people with FPL, and directly correlate to triglyceride levels.
 
Gemcabene is being studied in people with severe hypertriglyceridemia, defined as triglycerides above 500 mg/dL and Gemphire expects to report top-line results from its Phase 2 study in the second quarter of 2018.
 
Volanesorsen for the treatment of FCS is currently under regulatory review for marketing authorization in the U.S., EU and Canada. To date, volanesorsen has shown the highest percent of triglyceride reductions compared to existing treatments, such as fibrates, regardless of starting triglyceride levels prior to dosing with volanesorsen. Based on our broad Phase 2 data for the treatment of different patients including people with FCS, we believe that volanesorsen will work equally well as a single agent or in combination with other triglyceride-lowering drugs on the market. If regulatory authorities require us to implement platelet monitoring procedures in the commercial setting, which have yet to be determined, it could impact the future competitive profile of volanesorsen.
 
Inotersen
 
We believe that the following drugs could compete with inotersen:
 

Drug | Company | Drug Description | Phase | Admin/Dosing | Efficacy(1) | Safety(1) 
------------+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patisiran | Alnylam | An RNAi drug formulated with lipid nanoparticles to inhibit TTR mRNA | Registration | Infusion every 3 weeks with pre-treatment with steroids | 84.3% mean reduction in TTR at 18 months | Most common adverse events more frequently observed in patisiran arm vs. placebo were peripheral edema (29.7% vs. 22.1%) and infusion-related reactions (18.9% vs. 9.1%) 
Tafamidis | Pfizer | A small molecule drug to stabilize TTR Protein | 3 to support refiling in the U.S., Approved in the EU | Daily oral capsule | In 45% of people taking Tafamidis, nerve function either improved or stabilized, compared with 30% of patients taking placebo | Urinary tract infection, vaginal infection, upper abdominal pain and diarrhea 
Diflunisal | N/A Generic | A non-steroid anti-inflammatory agent | Approved (but not for ATTR) | Daily oral capsule/doses | Improved nerve function as shown by lower Neuropathy Impairment Score plus 7 nerve tests, or NIS+7. The NIS+7 score increased by 25.0 points in the placebo group versus 8.7 points in the diflunisal group | In two studies repurposing diflunisal for use in TTR amyloidosis, drug-related adverse events that led to discontinuation were: gastrointestinal bleeding, low platelets, deterioration of renal function, congestive heart failure, glaucoma and nausea.
Tolcapone | SOM Biotech | Small molecule repurposed generic drug | 2 | Daily oral dose | Shows binding and stabilization of TTR in humans | No drug related adverse events reported 
ALN-TTRsc02 | Alnylam | An RNAi drug conjugated with GalNAC to inhibit TTR mRNA in liver cells | 1 | Monthly or quarterly | In healthy volunteers, a single dose showed mean max TTR knockdown of 97% | Injection site reactions were reported 


(1) | Taken from public documents including respective company press releases, company presentations, and scientific presentations. Diflunisal efficacy and safety came from the published papers of two investigator sponsored studies, Berk JL, Suhr OB, Obici L, et al. Repurposing Diflunisal for Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy: A Randomized Clinical Trial. JAMA. 2013;310(24):2658-2667 and Sekijima YS, Toja K, Morita H, et al.

We believe that of the drugs that are in development or on the market, inotersen’s closest competitor is patisiran. Alnylam is developing patisiran for hATTR. Patisiran is an intravenously administered RNAi molecule that is formulated with lipid nanoparticles to enable delivery of the drug to the liver. It is administered via an infusion by a healthcare provider in a clinical setting every three weeks. People receiving patisiran are pretreated with steroids to prevent infusion related reactions. In October 2016, Alnylam discontinued development of revusiran, its drug for the cardiomyopathy form of TTR amyloidosis, due to a safety finding in its Phase 3 study. Revusiran was a subcutaneously administered RNAi molecule that was Alnylam’s first generation GalNAc drug and was dosed at 500 mg per week as two subcutaneous injections. Alnylam completed Phase 1 studies of its second generation GalNAC, ALN-TTRsc02. Because we have a PDUFA date of July 6, 2018 for inotersen and Alnylam’s PDUFA date for patisiran is August 11, 2018, we believe that inotersen could be the first RNA-targeted drug on the market for the treatment of people with hATTR. We also believe that the overall product profile of inotersen. as a once weekly, subcutaneous injection with no pretreatment has advantages to the drugs detailed above, however potential platelet and renal monitoring requirements in the commercial setting, which have yet to be determined, could impact the future competitive profile of inotersen.
 
Employees
 
As of February 20, 2018, we employed 547 people, including 100 Akcea employees. A significant number of our management and professional employees have had prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. Collective bargaining agreements do not cover any of our employees, and management considers relations with our employees to be good.
