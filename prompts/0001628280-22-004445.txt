ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Our Business
Gulfport is an independent natural gas-weighted exploration and production company with assets primarily located in the Appalachia and Anadarko basins. Our principal properties are located in Eastern Ohio, where we target development in what is commonly referred to as the Utica formation, and Central Oklahoma where we target development in the SCOOP Woodford and Springer formations. Gulfport's predecessor was incorporated in the State of Delaware in July 1997. Our corporate headquarters are located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and shares of Gulfport's common stock trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "GPOR". Our corporate strategy is focused on the economic development of our asset base in an effort to generate sustainable free cash flow. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 3.9 Tcfe of proved reserves with a Standardized Measure of $4.1 billion and a PV-10 of $4.3 billion. See "Definitions" above for our definition of PV-10 (a non-GAAP financial measure) and "Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Reserves" below for a reconciliation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) to PV-10.

Information contained on our website, or on other websites that may be linked to our website, is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this report or any other filing that we make with the SEC. 
Emergence From Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code 
On November 13, 2020, we and certain of our subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. The Chapter 11 Cases were administered jointly under the caption In re Gulfport Energy Corporation, et al., Case No. 20-35562 (DRJ). The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan and entered the confirmation order on April 28, 2021, and the Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases on the Emergence Date. On May 18, 2021, we began trading on the NYSE under the symbol "GPOR".
Although we are no longer a debtor-in-possession, we operated as debtors-in-possession through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. See Note 2 and Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the Chapter 11 Cases.
We believe we have emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases as a fundamentally stronger company, built to generate sustainable free cash flow, with a strengthened balance sheet. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we reduced our total indebtedness by $1.4 billion by issuing equity in a reorganized entity to the holders of our unsecured notes and allowed general unsecured claimants. In addition, Gulfport reassessed its organizational needs post emergence and significantly reduced its general and administrative expense to ensure its cost structure is competitive with industry peers. We continue to focus on optimizing development of our resource plays, reducing our operating costs, per well drilling costs, general and administrative costs, and managing our liquidity. We believe our plan to generate free cash flow on an annual basis will allow us to further strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders.
Business Strategy
Gulfport aims to create sustainable value through the economic development of our significant resource plays in the Utica and SCOOP operating areas. Our strategy is to develop our assets in an environmentally responsible manner, while generating sustainable cash flow, improving margins and operating efficiencies and returning capital to shareholders. To accomplish these goals, we allocate capital expenditures to projects we believe offer the highest rate of return and we deploy leading drilling and completion techniques and technologies in our development efforts.

2022 Outlook
Our 2022 capital expenditure program is expected to be in a range of $340 million to $380 million. We plan to operate on average approximately one operated rig in each of our Utica and SCOOP development areas. In the Utica, we intend to spud 15 gross (13.4 net) operated horizontal wells, complete drilling on 24 gross (21.7 net) operated horizontal wells and commence sales on 17 gross (15.6 net) horizontal wells. In the SCOOP, we intend to spud five gross (3.6 net) operated horizontal wells, complete drilling on 8 gross (5.5 net) operated horizontal wells and commence sales on 13 gross (10.3 net) operated horizontal wells. We expect to fund these expenditures with our operating cash flow and borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. 
We expect this drilling program to result in approximately 975 to 1,025 MMcfe per day of production in 2022.
Additionally, in 2022, we expect to focus on our strategy of returning capital to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter of 2021, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock and we paid our first cash dividend payment on our New Preferred Stock.
Operating Areas
Utica - The Utica covers hydrocarbon bearing rock formations located in the Appalachian Basin of the United States and Canada. We have approximately 187,000 net reservoir acres located primarily in Belmont, Harrison, Jefferson and Monroe Counties in Eastern Ohio where the Utica ranges in thickness from 600 to over 750 feet. During the Combined Period, we produced approximately 772 MMcfe per day net to our interests in this area and it accounts for approximately 77% of our total production.
SCOOP - The SCOOP is a defined area that encompasses many of the top hydrocarbon producing counties in Oklahoma within the Anadarko basin. The SCOOP play mainly targets the Devonian to Mississippian aged Woodford, Sycamore and Springer formations. We have approximately 74,000 net reservoir acres (comprised of approximately 41,000 in the Woodford formation and approximately 33,000 in the Springer formation) located primarily in Garvin, Grady and Stephens Counties. The Woodford Shale across our position ranges in thickness from 200 to over 400 feet and directly overlies the Hunton Limestone and underlies the Sycamore formation, both of which are also locally productive reservoirs. The Sycamore formation consists of hydrocarbon-bearing interbedded shales and siliceous limestones ranging in thickness from 150 to over 450 feet and is overlain by the Caney Shale. The Springer formation across our position is comprised of a series of lenticular sand and shale units. The primary targets are a series of porous, low clay and organic-rich packages within the Goddard Shale member ranging in thickness from 50 to over 250 feet. During the Combined Period, we produced approximately 231 MMcfe per day net to our interests in this area and it accounts for approximately 23% of our total production.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Reserves 
Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. As a result, the reserve estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, prices and future production rates and costs. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

(1)    Estimated future net revenue represents the estimated future revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs under existing economic conditions as of December 31, 2021, and assuming commodity prices as set forth below. For the purpose of determining prices used in our reserve reports, we used the unweighted arithmetic average of the prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period ended December 31, 2021. The prices used in our PV-10 measure were $66.55 per barrel and $3.60 per MMBtu, before basis differential adjustments. These prices should not be interpreted as a prediction of future prices, nor do they reflect the value of our commodity derivative instruments in place as of December 31, 2021. The amounts shown do not give effect to non-property-related expenses, such as corporate general and administrative expenses and debt service, or to depreciation, depletion and amortization. The present value of estimated future net revenue typically differs from the standardized measure because the former does not include the effects of estimated future income tax expense of $178 million as of December 31, 2021.
    Management uses PV-10, which is calculated without deducting estimated future income tax expenses, as a measure of the value of the Company's current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies. We also understand that securities analysts and rating agencies use this measure in similar ways. While estimated future net revenue and the present value thereof are based on prices, costs and discount factors which may be consistent from company to company, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows or any other measure of a company's financial or operating performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 
    A reconciliation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to PV-10 is presented above. Neither PV-10 nor the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows purport to represent the fair value of our proved oil and gas reserves.

Proved Reserves
Estimates of proved reserves and related information are presented in accordance with the requirements of the SEC's rules for the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting. These rules permit the use of reliable technologies to estimate and categorize reserves and require the use of the unweighted average of the first-of-the-month commodity prices, adjusted for location and quality differentials, for the prior 12 months (unless contractual arrangements designate the price) to calculate economic producibility of reserves and the discounted cash flows reported as the Standardized Measure of Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Reserves. Refer to Note 20 of our consolidated financial statements for more information pertaining to our proved reserves and the preparation of such estimates.
The following table summarizes the changes in our estimated proved reserves during 2021 (in Bcfe):

Proved Reserves, December 31, 2020 (Predecessor) | 2,588
Sales of oil and natural gas reserves in place | — 
Extensions and discoveries | 695 
Revisions of prior reserve estimates | 982 
Current production | (366)
Proved Reserves, December 31, 2021 (Successor) | 3,898
Total may not sum due to rounding. | 

Sales of oil and natural gas reserves in place. These are reductions to proved reserves resulting from the divestiture of minerals in place during a period. During 2021, we sold approximately 0.2 Bcfe of proved oil and natural gas reserves through various sales of our non-operated interests in our other non-core assets.
Extensions and discoveries. These are additions to our proved reserves that result from extension of the proved acreage of previously discovered reservoirs through additional drilling in periods subsequent to discovery. Extensions of approximately 694.6 Bcfe of proved reserves were primarily attributable to the continued development of our Utica and SCOOP acreage. We added 29 PUD locations in our Utica acreage for 352.2 Bcfe and 34 PUD locations in our SCOOP acreage for 342.2 Bcfe. The five-year development plan focused on generating sustainable cash flow limited our ability to add significant well locations.
Revisions of prior reserve estimates. Revisions represent changes in previous reserve estimates, either upward or downward, resulting from development plan changes, new information normally obtained from development drilling and production history or a change in economic factors, such as commodity prices, operating costs or development costs.
We experienced total upward revisions of 982.2 Bcfe in estimated proved reserves, of which 889.2 Bcfe was the result of commodity price changes. Commodity prices experienced volatility throughout 2021 and the 12-month average price for natural gas increased from $1.99 per MMBtu for 2020 to $3.60 per MMBtu for 2021, the 12-month average price for NGL increased from $15.40 per barrel for 2020 to $31.90 per barrel for 2021, and the 12-month average price for crude oil increased from $39.54 per barrel for 2020 to $66.55 per barrel for 2021. 
Upward revisions of 157.6 Bcfe were a result of a combination of well performance, operating and development cost improvements and working interest changes. A small downward revision of 64.6 Bcfe was also experienced as a result of the exclusion of 4 PUD locations in our Utica field when changes in our schedule moved development of these PUD locations beyond five years of initial booking. The development plan change reflects our commitment to capital discipline and funding future activities within cash flow and ongoing optimization of our development plan.
Additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and changes in proved reserves during the last three years are contained in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities, or Supplemental Information, in Note 20 of our consolidated financial statements.
Index to Financial Statements
Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUDs) 
As of December 31, 2021, our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 1,550 Bcf of natural gas, 8 MMBbl of oil and 22 MMBbl of NGL, for a total of 1,733 Bcfe. Approximately 65% and 35% of our PUD reserves at year-end 2021 were located in Utica and SCOOP, respectively. PUDs will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells commence production or there are no material incremental completion capital expenditures associated with such proved developed reserves. 
We record PUD reserves only after a development plan has been approved by our senior management and board of directors to complete the associated development drilling within five years from the time of initial booking. The PUD locations identified in our development plan are determined based on an analysis of the information that we have available at that time. After a development plan has been adopted, we may periodically make adjustments to the approved development plan due to events and circumstances that have occurred subsequent to the time the plan was approved. These circumstances may include changes in commodity price outlook and costs, delays in the availability of infrastructure, well permitting delays and new data from recently completed wells. 
The following table summarizes the changes in our estimated proved undeveloped reserves during 2021 (in Bcfe):

Proved Undeveloped Reserves, December 31, 2020 (Predecessor) | 1,061
Extensions and discoveries | 694 
Conversion to proved developed reserves | (362)
Revisions of prior reserve estimates | 341 
Proved Undeveloped Reserves, December 31, 2021 (Successor) | 1,733
Total may not sum due to rounding. | 

Extensions and discoveries. Our extensions of approximately 694.4 Bcfe were primarily attributed to the addition of 29 PUD drilling locations in the Utica field and 34 PUD drilling locations in the SCOOP field as a result of our current five-year development plan that is focused on generating sustainable cash flow.
Conversion to proved developed reserves. Our 2021 development activities resulted in the conversion of approximately 362.4 Bcfe into proved developed producing reserves, attributable to 12 PUD locations in the Utica field and 11 PUD locations in the SCOOP field. These 23 PUDs represent a conversion rate of 28% for 2021.
Revision of prior reserve estimates. We experienced total upward revisions of 340.8 Bcfe in estimated proved undeveloped reserves, of which 340.8 Bcfe was the result of improved commodity prices. The 12-month average price for natural gas increased from $1.99 per MMBtu for 2020 to $3.60 per MMBtu for 2021, the 12-month average price for NGL increased from $15.40 per barrel for 2020 to $31.90 per barrel for 2021, and the 12-month average price for crude oil increased from $39.54 per barrel for 2020 to $66.55 per barrel for 2021. 
We also experienced 67.6 Bcfe of downward revisions as a result of the exclusion of 4 PUD locations in our Utica field when changes in our schedule moved development of these PUD locations beyond five years of initial booking. These downward revisions were offset by upward revisions of 67.6 Bcfe in estimated proved reserves from a combination of working interest changes, well development design updates and operating and development cost improvements.
Costs incurred relating to the development of PUDs were approximately $268.1 million in 2021. 
All PUD drilling locations included in our 2021 reserve report are scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial booking. 
As of December 31, 2021, 0.01% of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed non-producing.
Reserves Estimation
Reserve estimates for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. ("NSAI") for all of our operating areas. 
Index to Financial Statements
NSAI is an independent petroleum engineering firm. A copy of the summary reserve reports is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Our independent third-party engineers do not own an interest in any of our properties and are not employed by us on a contingent basis. 
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with NSAI to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves. Our internal technical team members meet with NSAI periodically throughout the year to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process. We provide historical information to NSAI for our properties such as ownership interest, oil and gas production, well test data, commodity prices, operating and development costs and other considerations, including availability and costs of infrastructure and status of permits. Our Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates. He is a petroleum engineer with over 20 years of reservoir and operations experience. In addition, our geoscience staff has approximately 85 years combined industry experience and our reservoir staff has approximately 75 years combined experience. 
Internal Controls Over Proved Reserve Estimates
Our proved reserve estimates are prepared in accordance with our internal control procedures. These procedures, which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations, include the following: 
•review and verification of historical production, operating, marketing and capital data, which data is based on actual production as reported by us; 
•verification of property ownership by our land department;
•preparation of year-end reserve estimates by NSAI in coordination with our experienced reservoir engineers; 
•direct reporting responsibilities by our reservoir engineering department to our Chief Executive Officer; 
•review by our reservoir engineering department of all of our reported proved reserves at the close of each quarter, including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new proved undeveloped reserves additions; 
•provision of quarterly updates to our board of directors regarding operational data, including production, drilling and completion activity levels and any significant changes in our reserves;
•annual review by our board of directors of our year-end reserve report and year-over-year changes in our proved reserves, as well as any changes to our previously adopted development plans;
•annual review and approval by our senior management and our board of directors of a multi-year development plan; 
•annual review by our senior management of adjustments to our previously adopted development plan and considerations involved in making such adjustments; and
•annual review by our board of directors of changes in our previously approved development plan made by senior management and technical staff during the year, including the substitution, removal or deferral of PUD locations. 
PV-10 Sensitivities
As noted above, our December 31, 2021 proved reserves were calculated using prices based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the period January through December 2021 of $66.55 per barrel and $3.60 per MMBtu. Holding production and development costs constant, if SEC pricing were $73.21 per barrel and $3.96 per MMBtu, or a 10% increase, this would have resulted in an increase of 16.2 Bcfe of our total proved reserves and a $787 million increase in PV-10 value at December 31, 2021. Holding production and development costs constant, if SEC pricing were $59.90 per barrel and $3.24 per MMBtu, or a 10% decrease, this would have resulted in a decrease of 23.8 Bcfe of our total proved reserves and a $787 million decrease in PV-10 value at December 31, 2021. For each of these scenarios, the 139 PUDs that were economic at SEC pricing were included.

Of our leases that are not held by production, most have a five-year primary term, many of which include options to extend the primary term. We manage lease expirations to ensure that we do not experience unintended material expirations. Our leasehold management efforts include scheduling our operations to establish production in paying quantities in order to hold leases prior to the expiration dates, paying the prescribed lease extension payments, planning non-core divestitures or strategic acreage trades with other operators to high-grade our lease inventory and letting some leases expire that are no longer part of our development plans. The following table sets forth the potential expiration periods of gross and net undeveloped leasehold acres as of December 31, 2021:

Our Investments
Grizzly Oil Sands. We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Grizzly Holdings Inc., own a 24.5% interest in Grizzly. As of December 31, 2021, Grizzly had approximately 830,000 net acres under lease in the Athabasca, Peace River and Cold Lake oil sands regions of Alberta, Canada. Grizzly's operations have been suspended since 2016. Additionally, Grizzly had no proved reserves as of December 31, 2021. We elected to cease funding capital calls in 2019, and we have no obligation to fund any of the projects Grizzly is pursuing. Failure to fund capital calls may lead to continued dilution of our equity ownership interest in Grizzly. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we determined that we no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of Grizzly. As such, we discontinued equity method of accounting for our investment in Grizzly.
Index to Financial Statements
Mammoth Energy. As discussed in Note 15 of our consolidated financial statements, the Company's previously owned shares of the outstanding common stock of Mammoth Energy were used to settle Class 4A claims during 2021. The Company no longer owns any common stock of Mammoth Energy.
Marketing 
The principal function of our marketing operations is to provide natural gas, oil and NGL marketing services, including securing and negotiating commodity transactions, gathering, hauling, processing and transportation services, contract administration and nomination services for production from Gulfport-marketed wells. Generally, natural gas and NGL production is sold to purchasers under both spot and term transactions. Oil production is sold under both spot and term transactions with the majority of our sales contracts being shorter term in nature. 
We have entered into long-term gathering, processing and transportation contracts with various parties that reserve capacity for fixed, determinable quantities of production over specified periods of time. Some contracts require us to make payments for any shortfalls in delivering or transporting minimum volumes under these commitments. In addition, we periodically enter into a variety of oil, natural gas and NGL purchase and sale contracts with third parties for various commercial purposes, including risk mitigation and satisfaction of our firm transportation delivery commitments. These marketing activities often enhance the value of our production by aggregating volumes and allowing improved flexibility in relation to deal structure, size and counterparty exposure whether through intermediary markets or direct end markets. See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our commitments.
Major Customers
Our total natural gas, oil and NGL sales, before the effects of hedging, to major customers (purchasers in excess of 10% of total natural gas, oil and NGL sales) for the Successor Period, Predecessor Period, and years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:

Competition 
The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with many other companies that have greater resources than we have. Competition can negatively impact our ability to successfully source quality vendors and service providers, to secure optimal pipeline access and end markets in which to sell our production, to acquire new properties, and our search for, and the development of, reserves. Many of our competitors not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also have midstream and further downstream operations and market a variety of hydrocarbon products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. In addition, oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include renewable sources such as wind or solar energy in addition to coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas.
Index to Financial Statements
Seasonality
Gulfport drills and completes wells throughout the year, but adverse weather conditions can impact drilling, completion, and field operations, which can impact overall production volumes. Seasonal anomalies can minimize or exaggerate the impact on these operations, while extreme weather events can materially constrain our operations for short periods of time.
Title to Oil and Natural Gas Properties 
It is customary in the oil and natural gas industry to make only a preliminary review of title to undeveloped oil and natural gas leases at the time they are acquired and to obtain more extensive title examinations when acquiring producing properties. In future acquisitions, we will conduct title examinations on material portions of such properties in a manner generally consistent with industry practice. Certain of our oil and natural gas properties may be subject to certain imperfections in title, encumbrances, easements, servitudes or other restrictions, none of which, in management's opinion, will in the aggregate materially restrict our operations. 
Regulation - Environment, Health and Safety 
Exploration and Production, Environmental, Health and Safety, and Occupational Laws and Regulations
Our operations are subject to federal, tribal, state, and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate to matters that include, but are not limited to, the following:
•reporting of workplace injuries and illnesses;
•industrial hygiene monitoring;
•worker protection and workplace safety;
•approval or permits to drill and to conduct operations;
•provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations;
•calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and production taxes;
•seismic operations and data;
•location, drilling, cementing and casing of wells;
•well design and construction of pad and equipment;
•construction and operations activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas that contain endangered or threatened species, their habitats, or sites of cultural significance;
•method of completing wells;
•hydraulic fracturing;
•water withdrawal;
•well production and operations, including processing and gathering systems;
•emergency response, contingency plans and spill prevention plans;
•air emissions and fluid discharges;
•climate change;
•use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations;
•surface usage, maintenance, monitoring and the restoration of properties associated with well pads, pipelines, impoundments and access roads;
•plugging and abandoning of wells; and
•transportation of production.
Shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change and requiring agencies to review environmental actions taken by the Trump administration, as well as a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the Biden administration has reviewed and approved the rule. These executive orders in part led to the US again depositing an instrument of acceptance of the Paris Agreement, created in 2015 during the United Nations (“U.N.”) Climate Change Conference, which thereafter re-entered into force for the US on February 19, 2021. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. The terms of the Paris Agreement and the executive orders are expected to result in 
Index to Financial Statements
additional regulations or changes to existing regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business. The executive orders and international accord may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations. Failure to comply with laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of remedial liabilities, fines, or criminal penalties or to injunctions limiting our operations in affected areas. Moreover, multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits which allow environmental organizations to act in the place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law. We consider the costs of environmental protection and of safety and health compliance to be necessary, manageable parts of our business. We have been able to plan for and comply with environmental, safety and health laws and regulations without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures. However, based on policy and regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws, our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to compliance with the protection of the environment, safety and health have increased over the years and may continue to increase. We cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters. See the Risk Factors described in Item 1A. of this report for further discussion of governmental regulation and ongoing regulatory changes, including with respect to environmental matters.
Our operations are also subject to conservation regulations, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit, the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In the United States, some states allow the compulsory pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration and development. Other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, federal and state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and state conservation laws impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. These regulations often impose additional operational costs to us and can also limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.
Regulatory proposals in some states and local communities have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. Federal and state agencies have continued to assess the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, which could spur further action toward federal, state and/or local legislation and regulation. Further restrictions of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of natural gas, oil and NGL that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities from our properties.
Certain of our U.S. natural gas and oil leases are granted or approved by the federal government and administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) of the Department of the Interior. Such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government, tribes or tribal members. The federal government has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding, venting and flaring, oil and gas measurement and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands. In addition, on January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary for the Department of the Interior signed an order effectively suspending new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on federal lands for 60 days. Then on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order indefinitely suspending new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. To the extent that the review results in the development of additional restrictions on drilling, limitations on the availability of leases, or restrictions on the ability to obtain required permits, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
Permitting activities on federal lands are also subject to frequent delays.
Delays in obtaining permits or an inability to obtain new permits or permit renewals could inhibit our ability to execute our drilling and production plans. Failure to comply with applicable regulations or permit requirements could result in revocation of our permits, inability to obtain new permits and the imposition of fines and penalties.
Operating Hazards and Insurance 
The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. If any of these should occur, we could incur legal defense costs and could suffer substantial losses due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, and suspension of operations. Our horizontal and deep drilling activities involve greater risk of mechanical problems than vertical and shallow drilling operations.
Index to Financial Statements
We maintain a control of well insurance policy with a $25 million single well limit and a $35 million multiple wells limit that insures against certain sudden and accidental risks associated with drilling, completing and operating our wells. This insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or exposure to liability. We also carry a $51 million comprehensive general liability umbrella insurance policy. In addition, we maintain a $10 million pollution liability insurance policy providing coverage for gradual pollution related risks and in excess of the general liability policy for sudden and accidental pollution risks. We provide workers' compensation insurance coverage to employees in all states in which we operate. While we believe these policies are customary in the industry, they do not provide complete coverage against all operating risks, and policy limits scale to our working interest percentage in certain situations. In addition, our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover every claim made against us or may not be commercially available for purchase in the future.
We have prepared and have in place spill prevention control and countermeasure plans for each of our principal facilities in response to federal and state requirements. The plans go through a technical review every five years and are updated as necessary. As required by applicable regulations, our facilities are built with secondary containment systems to capture potential releases. We also own additional spill kits with oil booms and absorbent pads that are readily available, if needed. In addition, we have emergency response companies on retainer. These companies specialize in the clean-up of hydrocarbons as a result of spills, blow-outs and natural disasters, and are on call to us 24 hours a day, seven days a week when their services are needed. We pay these companies a retainer plus additional amounts when they provide us with clean up services. Our aggregate payments for the retainer and clean-up services during each of 2021 and 2020 were immaterial. While these companies have been able to meet our service needs when required from time to time in the past, it is possible that the ability of one or more of them to provide services to us in the future, if and when needed, could be hindered or delayed in the event of a widespread disaster. However, in light of the areas in which we operate and the nature of our production, we believe other companies would be available to us in the event our primary remediation companies are unable to perform.
Human Capital Management
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 212 employees, a reduction from 256 employees the previous year. The reduction was due to the rightsizing of our organization through a controlled hiring program and a small reduction in workforce in August of 2021. All of our employees are non-bargaining. Attraction and retention of people remains one of the highest strategic goals of the organization. We remain focused on the retention and development of existing employees, as their continued commitment is critical to our success. 
During 2021, we continued to adapt to the changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, by regularly assessing COVID-19 employee protocols, minimizing the numbers of people in our offices at times, conducting daily health screenings for all employees and visitors, and completing thorough contact tracing. These efforts helped protect the safety of employees, minimize the risk of transmission at Gulfport locations and keep our operations online with minimal disruption.
Inclusion & Diversity
During 2021, we continued to work on the diversity and inclusion projects that we announced in 2020 and held peer-led, small group discussions for all employees aimed at understanding how they view diversity and ways we could continue to focus on it in a meaningful way going forward. Based partly on feedback from those discussions, the Company delivered an unconscious bias training program for all employees to better help them understand themselves and how they view those around them. The results of these efforts have been overwhelmingly positive and have positioned us to further our diversity and inclusion initiatives in 2022 and beyond.
During 2021, our Board of Directors completely turned over as a result of the bankruptcy process and is now comprised of 40% of highly qualified diverse candidates as of the end of 2021. While 2021 was a year in which we again added very few new employees, approximately 29% of our newly hired employees were diverse hires. We are committed to evaluating our hiring and promotion practices to make sure that a diversity and inclusion mindset is considered and included throughout the Company.
In 2021, many Gulfport policies were added or revised, and a new Business Code of Conduct and Ethics training was provided to all employees. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of business ethics and the employee training provided a clear review of our expectations.

Health, Safety & Environment (HSE)
Safety is at the forefront of everything we do. We have a robust annual training program, which includes environmental, health, and safety topics. Our safety program, WORK SAFE, is comprised of twelve key topics including critical tasks and cultural conditions. We hold regular safety briefings to discuss daily operations and routinely have safety stand-down meetings to highlight potential risks. Every employee is empowered to use their stop-work authority to cease operating if work is being performed in an unsafe manner. We monitor employee safety by establishing annual company-wide key safety metrics tied to leading indicators (i.e., incident reporting and investigations, hazard observations, safety and health meetings) and lagging indicators (i.e., injury rates and preventable motor vehicle accidents). 
As part of our focus on continuous improvement, we monitor and communicate key environmental and safety metrics both internally and externally. Trend analysis guides us to make operational changes and policy updates as necessary to protect our employees, the public, and the environment. We establish and carefully track key environmental and safety metrics that are a component of every employee’s incentive compensation opportunity for 2021.
We have established several programs to ensure that our employees and external partners are appropriately trained to perform the critical work we do safely and effectively. We continued to reinforce our Work Safe Program and provided training to leaders on reinforcement strategies. Additionally, we launched the Work Green program in 2021, which focuses on protecting the air, land and water where we operate and includes community-based volunteer events targeting environmental clean-up and habitat improvement initiatives. 
Training & Development
Gulfport invests in our employees' professional growth to build strong teams and develop leaders for today and the future. We build our dynamic team of industry-leading professionals by engaging them in interesting and rewarding work and by providing training and development opportunities. We utilize in-person training sessions developed by safety experts and supplement these sessions with computer-based modules to support a safety-first mindset in everything we do. We continue to provide training resources to employees through universities, electronic content services and specialized courses related to our industry through our tuition reimbursement program or third-party providers.
