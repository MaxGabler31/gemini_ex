 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
  
  OVERVIEW
  
     We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Currently, we are developing two therapies targeting hematologic malignancies. TG-1101 (ublituximab) is a novel, glycoengineered monoclonal antibody that targets a unique epitope on the CD20 antigen found on mature B-lymphocytes. We are also developing TGR-1202 (umbralisib), an orally available PI3K delta inhibitor. The delta isoform of PI3K is strongly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin and is believed to be important in the proliferation and survival of B-lymphocytes. Both TG-1101 and TGR-1202, or the combination which is referred to as "U2," are in Phase 3 clinical development for patients with hematologic malignancies, with TG-1101 also in Phase 3 clinical development for patients with multiple sclerosis. Additionally, the Company has recently brought its anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody into Phase 1 development and aims to bring additional pipeline assets into the clinic in the future. 
  
 We also actively evaluate complementary products, technologies and companies for in-licensing, partnership, acquisition and/or investment opportunities. To date, we have not received approval for the sale of any of our drug candidates in any market and, therefore, have not generated any product sales from our drug candidates.

  TG-1101 (ublituximab)
  
  Overview
  
 TG-1101 (ublituximab) is a chimeric, glycoengineered monoclonal antibody that targets a unique epitope on the CD20 antigen found on the surface of B-lymphocytes developed to aid in the depletion of circulating B-cells. We hold exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize TG-1101 for all indications, except for the territories of France and Belgium which have been retained by LFB Biotechnologies (“LFB”), and South Korea and Southeast Asia which were licensed by us to Ildong Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd (“Ildong”) in November 2012.
  
 Generally, anti-CD20 antibodies are believed to exert their B-cell depleting effects through three primary mechanisms: antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (“ADCC”), complement dependent cytotoxicity (“CDC”), and direct or programmed cell death (“DCD” or “PCD”). TG-1101 has been specifically glycoengineered to enhance ADCC activity, which should enhance its ability to deplete B-cells and may improve its anti-cancer effects when compared to Rituxan®, the leading anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, which had worldwide sales in 2016 of more than $7 billion.
  
 Two single-agent, dose-escalation, Phase I studies were undertaken with TG-1101 to establish an optimal dose in patients with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (“NHL”) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (“CLL”). A two part first-in-human Phase I clinical trial was first completed in France in which TG-1101 was evaluated in relapsed or refractory CLL. Subsequently, a single-agent Phase I study was undertaken in the US enrolling patients with both NHL and CLL. In both studies, single agent therapy with TG-1101 was deemed well tolerated by treating investigators and displayed promising clinical activity in relapsed and refractory patients.
 
 In oncology settings, anti-CD20 therapy is generally used in combination with other anti-cancer agents where it demonstrates maximum activity as opposed to single agent usage. As a result, subsequent clinical development for TG-1101 has focused on combination therapy. Currently, our priority combination trials for TG-1101 are:
   ●
  The GENUINE Trial – a randomized controlled Phase 3 trial evaluating TG-1101 in combination with ibrutinib, for previously treated CLL patients with high risk cytogenetics;

  ●
  The UNITY-CLL Trial – a randomized controlled Phase 3 trial under Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) evaluating TG-1101 in combination with TGR-1202, the Company’s development stage PI3K delta inhibitor, for patients with front line and previously treated CLL;

  ●
  The UNITY-NHL Trial – registration-directed Phase 2b clinical study evaluating TGR-1202 alone and in combination with TG-1101 with or without bendamustine, in patients with previously treated Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL); and

  ●
  TG-1101 + TGR-1202 + Pembrolizumab for patients with CLL.

 
 In non-oncology settings, anti-CD20 therapy has generally been used as monotherapy. In addition to the above oncology studies, TG-1101 is being evaluated in a Phase 2 study for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and in an investigator initiated Phase 1 study for the treatment of acute neuromyelitis optica (NMO) relapses, with additional autoimmune related indications planned to be studied. On August 1, 2017, we announced we had reached an agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) on the design of two global Phase 3 clinical trials for TG-1101, referred to as the ULTIMATE I and ULTIMATE II Phase 3 clinical trials, both of which are currently open to enrollment.
  
 Manufacturing of TG-1101 is currently performed by a contract manufacturer based in the US and our partner, LFB Biotechnologies.

  Pre-Clinical Data Overview
  
 The mechanism of action of anti-CD20 antibodies, including rituximab and TG-1101 has been elucidated and detailed in numerous academic and clinical studies. Upon conjugation of the antibody to the CD20 surface antigen, rituximab has been found to deplete B-lymphocytes through three primary mechanisms: ADCC, CDC, and DCD or PCD.
  
 Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC, is a mechanism that is dependent on interactions between the Fc region of the antibody and the FccR receptors on immune system effector cells, most notably the FccRIIIA (CD16) receptor found on NK cells. These interactions trigger cells to release cytotoxic molecules and proteases resulting in B-cell death. TG-1101 is a third generation, type I chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody with a glycoengineered Fc region designed specifically to induce higher ADCC activity in comparison to rituximab, which has been demonstrated in pre-clinical models.
  
  Clinical Data Overview and Recent Developments
  
  Single Agent TG-1101 in Relapsed/Refractory NHL & CLL
  
 Our first US based trial entitled "An Open Label Phase I/II Trial of the Efficacy and Safety of TG-1101 in Patients with B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma who have Relapsed or are Refractory After CD20 Directed Antibody Therapy," was launched in the third quarter of 2012. In July 2014, this trial completed enrollment at 35 patients, of which 12 patients were included in the dose escalation component and 23 patients in various expansion cohorts. All enrolled patients were relapsed or refractory to Rituxan® or a Rituxan® containing regimen, and in most cases multiple other lines of therapy. Dr. Owen O'Connor, Professor of Medicine and Director, Center for Lymphoid Malignancies at New York Presbyterian Columbia Medical Center was the Principal Investigator for the multi-center study.
  
 Data from this study was published in full in the British Journal of Haematology in February 2017:
  
  TG-1101 in Combination with TGR-1202 with/without ibrutinib or bendamustine for Relapsed/Refractory NHL & CLL
  
 In November 2013, we initiated a multi-center, Phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of TG-1101 and TGR-1202, the Company's novel, once per day, PI3K delta inhibitor, for patients with relapsed and/or refractory CLL and NHL. Additional cohorts were added to this study to explore the triple therapy combination of TG-1101, TGR-1202, and ibrutinib and the triple therapy of TG-1101, TGR-1202 and bendamustine.
  
 The MD Anderson Cancer Center is the lead center for the trial with Nathan Fowler, MD, Assistant Professor and Co-Director of Clinical Research in the Department of Lymphoma, as the Study Chair for the NHL patient group and Susan O’Brien, MD, Professor and Medical Director for Cancer Clinical Trials and Research at UC Irvine as the Study Chair for the CLL patient group. The data from this study supports the current Phase 3 UNITY-CLL study of U2 in CLL and the registration-directed UNITY-NHL Phase 2b clinical study of U2 + bendamustine in DLBCL.

  Updated data from this study was most recently presented at the 22nd European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress in Madrid, Spain in June 2017.
  
 Both triplet combinations demonstrated acceptable levels of tolerability with promising activity. Enrollment in both cohorts is now closed and patients continued to be followed for safety and efficacy.
  
  TG-1101 in Combination with Ibrutinib for Relapsed/Refractory MCL & CLL
  
 In December 2013, we initiated a multi-center Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of TG-1101 and ibrutinib for patients with CLL and MCL. Jeff Sharman, MD, Medical Director for Hematology Research, US Oncology Network, was the Study Chair. This trial has completed enrollment.
  
 Final data from the MCL cohort of this study was presented at the 57th Annual American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting held in December 2015, with data from the CLL cohort published in full in the British Journal of Haematology in December 2016.
  
 Overall, in both CLL and MCL, aside from day 1 Infusion related reactions (IRR), the addition of TG-1101 did not appear to alter the safety profile seen historically with single agent ibrutinib. Of the 60 patients treated, 41 CLL and 15 MCL patients were evaluable for response. The combination displayed marked clinical activity, reporting an 88% (35/41) response rate in patients with CLL, a 95% (19/21) response rate in those CLL patients with high-risk cytogenetics, and an 87% (13/15) response rate in patients with MCL. The data from the CLL cohort of this study supported the Phase 3 GENUINE study of the combination in CLL patients with high-risk cytogenetics.
  
  TG-1101 + Ibrutinib Phase 3 Study Program – The GENUINE Trial
  
 The GENUINE trial is a randomized controlled clinical trial in patients with previously treated CLL with specific high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, with patients randomized to receive either TG-1101 plus ibrutinib or ibrutinib alone. In October 2016, we announced revisions to the design of the GENUINE study to accelerate its completion. Initially the study was being conducted pursuant to a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and was designed to enroll approximately 330 patients, with a two-part analysis of both overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). The trial was amended in October 2016 to enroll approximately 120 patients, with the PFS analysis component removed. Following the revisions, the sole primary endpoint of the study is ORR, and the SPA is no longer in effect.
  
 In June 2017, the positive results from our Phase 3 GENUINE trial were presented by Dr. Jeff Sharman, Medical Director, Hematology Research, US Oncology in an oral session during the 53rd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL.
  
 This presentation included data from the GENUINE Phase 3 trial, a multicenter, randomized trial, which assessed the efficacy and safety of TG-1101 plus ibrutinib versus ibrutinib alone in patients with high risk CLL. For the trial, high-risk was defined as having any one or more of the following centrally confirmed features: 17p deletion, 11q deletion or p53 mutation. The GENUINE study was designed to demonstrate the value of adding TG-1101 to ibrutinib monotherapy in high-risk CLL, and was powered to show a statistically significant improvement in ORR of 30%, with a minimal absolute detectable difference between the two arms of approximately 20%.
  
 The trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in Overall Response Rate (ORR), as assessed by blinded independent central radiology and hematology review by iwCLL (Hallek 2008) criteria, compared to ibrutinib alone in both the Intent to Treat (ITT) population (p=0.001) and Treated population (p < 0.001). Per iwCLL guidelines, all responders required confirmation of response for a minimum duration of 2 months. The ITT population included all 126 randomized patients (64 in the TG-1101 plus ibrutinib arm and 62 in the ibrutinib alone arm) while the Treated population includes all ITT patients that received at least one dose of either study drug (59 in the TG-1101 plus ibrutinib arm and 58 in the ibrutinib alone arm).

 One hundred and seventeen (117) patients were evaluable for safety (59 patients in the TG-1101 plus ibrutinib arm, and 58 patients in the ibrutinib alone arm). The combination was well tolerated and, apart from infusion related reactions, the addition of TG-1101 did not appear to alter the safety profile of ibrutinib monotherapy. Neutropenia, occurring in 9% of patients, was the most commonly reported Grade 3/4 Adverse Event (AE) in the combination arm, followed by infusion related reactions and anemia, each reported in 5% of patients. Notably, the majority of infusion related reactions (IRR) were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, with only 5% Grade 3/4 IRR observed. Median follow-up for this study was approximately 11.4 months.
  
  Response Rates
  
 
 | TG-1101 plus Ibrutinib | Ibrutinib | P-value
----------------------------+------------------------+---------------+--------
Treated Population (n) | n=59 | n=58 | 
Overall Response Rate (ORR) | 78% | 45% | P<0.001
Complete Response (CR) | 7% | 0% | NS 
MRD-Negative | 19% (n=53) * | 2% (n=53) * | P<0.01 


  *Patients evaluable for MRD included those enrolled >4 months prior to data cutoff date of February 15, 2017. MRD analyzed by central lab, 7-color flow cytometry
  
 In October 2017, we announced the outcome of a meeting with the FDA regarding the use of the results from the GENUINE Phase 3 trial to support a Biologics License Application (BLA) filing for approval of TG-1101 in combination with ibrutinib. During the meeting, the FDA confirmed that accelerated approval based on ORR would be a review issue. As part of the discussion, the FDA encouraged us to consider future available therapy in its risk/benefit analysis as part of any potential future BLA filing that may impact accelerated approval.
  
 We continue to follow patients in the GENUINE study for safety and efficacy including Overall Response, MRD and Progression Free Survival (PFS). We are currently working on preparing a Biologics License Application for a potential accelerated approval filing for TG-1101 in combination with ibrutinib in previously treated CLL patients with high-risk cytogenetics, which filing could occur in 2018.
  
  TG-1101 in Combination with TGR-1202 Phase 3 Study Program – The UNITY-CLL Trial
  
 In September 2015, we reached an agreement with the FDA regarding an SPA on the design, endpoints and statistical analysis approach of a Phase 3 clinical trial for the proprietary combination of TG-1101 plus TGR-1202, for the treatment of CLL. The SPA provides agreement that the Phase 3 trial design adequately addresses objectives that, if met, would support the regulatory submission for drug approval of both TG-1101 and TGR-1202 in combination.
  
 The Phase 3 trial, called the UNITY-CLL trial, is a randomized controlled clinical trial that includes two key objectives: first, to demonstrate contribution of each agent in the TG-1101 + TGR-1202 regimen (the combination sometimes referred to as "U2"), and second, to demonstrate superiority in Progression Free Survival (PFS) over the standard of care to support the submission for full approval of the combination. The study will randomize patients into four treatment arms: TG-1101 + TGR-1202, TG-1101 alone, TGR-1202 alone, and an active control arm of obinutuzumab (GAZYVA®) + chlorambucil. An early interim analysis will assess contribution of each single agent in the TG-1101 + TGR-1202 combination regimen, which, if successful, will allow early termination of both single agent arms. A second interim analysis will be conducted following full enrollment into the study, which, if positive, we plan to utilize for accelerated approval.

 In May 2017, we announced that the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the UNITY-CLL Phase 3 trial had successfully completed a pre-specified interim analysis to assess the contribution of TG-1101 and TGR-1202 in the combination regimen of TG-1101 plus TGR-1202. In conducting the analysis, the DSMB reviewed efficacy data from approximately 50 patients per arm in the UNITY-CLL study who were eligible for at least one response evaluation. Based on the overall response rate data available, and in accordance with the statistical analysis plan in the study's SPA, the DSMB determined that contribution has been established and recommended we cease enrollment into the single agent arms. Accordingly, in May the study began enrolling in a 1:1 ratio to only the two combination arms: the investigational arm of TG-1101 plus TGR-1202 and the control arm of obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil. Additionally, the DSMB reviewed safety data from all patients on study (n > 270) as of the data cut-off date, including patients with both treatment naive and relapsed/refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), and again identified no safety concerns in any treatment group (treatment naive or previously treated) and recommended the continuation of the study without modification.
  
 In September 2017, we announced that target enrollment in the UNITY-CLL trial was met and that we were extending enrollment until October 12, 2017 for any additional identified study patients to be allowed in the trial. We expect top-line ORR data from this study to be reported in 2018.
  
  TG-1101 in Combination with TGR-1202 with or without bendamustine Phase 2b Registration-Directed Program – The UNITY-NHL Trial
  
 In June 2016, we commenced a registration-directed UNITY-DLBCL Phase 2b clinical study evaluating TG-1101 in combination with TGR-1202, as well as TGR-1202 alone, in patients with previously treated DLBCL. In mid-2017, this study was expanded to allow enrollment of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), as well as to add a cohort evaluating the triplet regimen of TG-1101 + TGR-1202 + bendamustine which has previously been explored in Phase 1. The cohorts of DLBCL, FL/SLL, and MZL are each being enrolled to and evaluated independently.
  
 The updated study, called UNITY-NHL, is entitled "A Phase 2b Randomized Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of the Combination of Ublituximab + TGR-1202 with or without bendamustine and TGR-1202 alone in Patients with Previously Treated Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.” The DLBCL component is being led by Owen A. O'Connor, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine and Experimental Therapeutics, and Director of the Center for Lymphoid Malignancies at Columbia University Medical Center, while the indolent NHL component of the study is being led by Nathan H. Fowler, MD, Associate Professor, Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of TGR-1202 alone, in combination with TG-1101, or in combination with TG-1101 and bendamustine in patients with previously treated NHL as measured by Overall Response Rate (ORR). The study will also provide important information as to the contribution of each agent, TGR-1202 and TG-1101, to the combination regimen of both agents, as well as the contribution of bendamustine to the combination regimen of both agents.
  
 In August 2017, we announced that the study’s Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) had met and, based on pre-set hurdles designed to evaluate ORR, the DSMB recommended continued enrollment in the TGR-1202 + TG-1101 ("U2") arm and no further enrollment into the single agent TGR-1202 arm for the DLBCL cohort. As set forth in the protocol, the single agent TGR-1202 arm was replaced with the triple combination of TG-1101 + TGR-1202 + bendamustine.
  
  Single Agent TG-1101 in Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis
  
 In May 2016, we commenced our first study of TG-1101 in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS).
  
 The study, entitled "A Placebo-Controlled Multi-Center Phase 2 Dose Finding Study of Ublituximab, a Third-Generation Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibody, in Patients with Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis," is being led by Edward Fox, MD, PhD, Director of the Multiple Sclerosis Clinic of Central Texas and Clinical Assistant Professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Round Rock, TX. The primary objective of the study is to determine the optimal dosing regimen for TG-1101 with a focus on accelerating infusion times. In addition to monitoring for safety and tolerability at each dosing cohort, B-cell depletion and established MS efficacy endpoints will also be evaluated.

 Data from this study was most recently presented at the Third Annual ACTRIMS Forum 2018 meeting in San Diego, CA, with additional data presentations expected at upcoming medical conferences.
  
  TG-1101 in relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis Phase 3 Study Program – The ULITIMATE I and ULTIMATE II Trial
  
 In August 2017, we reached an agreement with the FDA regarding an SPA on the design of two Phase 3 clinical trials for TG-1101, for the treatment of relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS). The SPA provides agreement that the two Phase 3 trial designs adequately address objectives that, if met, would support the regulatory submission for approval of TG-1101.
  
 The RMS Phase 3 program consists of two trials, called the ULTIMATE I and ULTIMATE II trials. Each trial is a global, randomized, multi-center, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-controlled study comparing TG-1101 (ublituximab) to teriflunomide in subjects with RMS. The primary endpoint for each study is Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) following 96 weeks of treatment. Each trial is ongoing and will enroll approximately 440 subjects, randomized in a 1:1 ratio, with approximately 880 patients to be enrolled across both trials.
  
  Updates for the combination of TG-1101 and TGR-1202
  
 In January 2017, we announced that the FDA has granted orphan drug designation covering the combination of TG-1101 and TGR-1202 for the treatment of patients with CLL and DLBCL.
  
  TGR-1202
  
  Overview
  
 The phosphoinositide-3-kinases (“PI3Ks”) are a family of enzymes involved in various cellular functions, including cell proliferation and survival, cell differentiation, intracellular trafficking, and immunity. There are four isoforms of PI3K (alpha, beta, delta, and gamma), of which the delta (d) isoform is strongly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, and often implicated in B-cell related lymphomas.
  
 TGR-1202 is an orally available PI3K delta inhibitor with nanomolar potency to the delta isoform and high selectivity over the alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms. TGR-1202 has demonstrated activity in several pre-clinical models and primary cells from patients with various hematologic malignancies.
  
 We hold exclusive rights to develop and commercialize TGR-1202 for all indications worldwide, except India which has been retained by Rhizen Pharmaceuticals, SA.
  
 The Company’s Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for TGR-1202 was accepted by the FDA in December 2012 and a first in-human Phase I clinical trial was initiated in January 2013.

  Updates for TGR-1202
  
 In August 2016, we announced that TGR-1202 had received orphan drug designation for the treatment of CLL.
  
 In October 2016, a manuscript titled, "Silencing c-Myc Translation as a Therapeutic Strategy through Targeting PI3K Delta and CK1 Epsilon in Hematological Malignancies," was published online in the First Edition section of Blood, the Journal of the American Society of Hematology. The publication presents preclinical data describing the synergy of TGR-1202 with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib and the unique effects of the combination to silence c-Myc in various preclinical lymphoma and myeloma models. In addition, the manuscript for the first time reports on TGR-1202's unique complimentary mechanism of inhibiting the protein kinase casein kinase-1 (CK1) epsilon, which may contribute to the silencing of c-Myc and explain TGR-1202's clinical activity in aggressive lymphoma, including Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).
  
 In February 2018, data from the first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial of TGR-1202 was published online in The Lancet Oncology. The manuscript was titled, “Umbralisib, a novel PI3K and casein kinase-1 epsilon inhibitor, in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphoma: an open-label, phase 1, dose-escalation, first-in-human study,” The paper includes safety and efficacy information from 90 patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies, including patients with CLL and various forms of lymphoma treated with single agent TGR-1202. In this study, the data showed that TGR-1202 was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile distinct from prior generation PI3K delta inhibitors.
  
  Clinical Data Overview and Recent Developments
  
 Initial clinical development of TGR-1202 was focused on establishing preliminary safety and efficacy in a wide variety of hematologic malignancies. Upon identification of safe and active doses of TGR-1202, additional clinical trial programs were opened, exploring TGR-1202 as a single agent and in combination with a variety of agents. In addition to the previously described studies in combination with TG-1101, our current priority clinical trials that are ongoing for TGR-1202 include:
  
    ●

  TGR-1202 as a single agent in CLL patients who are intolerant to prior BTK inhibitor or PI3K delta inhibitor therapy;

  ●
  TGR-1202 in combination with the BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, in patients with previously treated CLL and MCL; and

  ●
  TGR-1202 in combination with the JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib (JAKAFI®), in patients with previously treated Myelofibrosis or Polycythemia Vera.

 
  Single Agent TGR-1202 in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Hematologic Malignancies
  
 In January 2013, the Company initiated a Phase I, open label, multi-center, first-in-human clinical trial of TGR-1202 in patients with hematologic malignancies. The study entitled TGR-1202-101, "A Phase I Dose Escalation Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of TGR-1202 in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Hematologic Malignancies," is being run in collaboration with the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, TN with Howard “Skip” Burris, MD, Executive Director, Drug Development as the acting Study Chair. Enrollment is open to patients with relapsed or refractory NHL, CLL, and other select hematologic malignancies. As of February 2016, this study has closed to enrollment.
  
 Data from this ongoing Phase I study was published in full in The Lancet Oncology in February 2018.
  
  TGR-1202 Long-term Follow-up Integrated Analysis in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Hematologic Malignancies
  
 In December 2017, at the 59th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, the Company presented integrated data with long term follow-up from 347 patients exposed to TGR-1202 across 5 studies, which continued to demonstrate high response rates in CLL, and FL coupled with a favorable safety profile distinct from other PI3K delta inhibitors.

  TGR-1202 TKI Intolerance Study
  
 In December 2017, at the 59th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, the Company presented data from 33 patients with CLL who were intolerant to prior BTK or PI3K delta inhibitor therapy who were then treated with single agent TGR-1202. TGR-1202 appeared to demonstrate a favorable safety profile in patients intolerant to prior ibrutinib (BTK) or idelalisib (PI3K) with only 2 patients (6%) discontinuing due to an adverse event, neither of which was a recurrent adverse event from their prior BTK or PI3K therapy. Enrollment continues in this Phase 2 study.
 TGR-1202 Combination Trials
  
 TGR-1202 is being evaluated in combination with the anti-CD30 antibody drug conjugate, brentuximab vedotin, in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma; in combination with the BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, in patients with CLL and MCL; and in combination with the JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, in patients with Myelofibrosis or Polycythemia Vera. Additional investigator sponsored trials are also underway which are combining TGR-1202 with other approved agents for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.
  
 It is anticipated that results from these studies will be presented or updated at future medical conferences. 
  
  TGR-1202 in Solid Tumors
  
 In addition to the exploration of TGR-1202 in various hematologic malignancies, a study was opened in October 2015 to evaluate TGR-1202 as a single agent as well as in combination with various chemotherapies for the treatment of select solid tumors. The study, entitled TGR-1202-102, “A Phase I Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of TGR-1202 Alone and in Combination with either nab-paclitaxel + Gemcitabine or with FOLFOX in Patients with Select Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors” is being run in collaboration with the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, TN with Johanna Bendell, MD, Director of GI Oncology Research as the acting study chair. The study is currently closed to enrollment with patients continuing to be followed for safety and efficacy.
 Market Opportunity for TG-1101 & TGR-1202
  
 Our lead products under development, TG-1101 and TGR-1202 are for the treatment of B-cell hematologic malignancies. Hematologic malignancies include cancers derived from the bone marrow and lymph tissue. The non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) represent a heterogeneous subset of these malignancies. Underneath the single rubric of lymphoma exist some of the most aggressive growing cancers (Burkitt’s lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma), as well as some of the most indolent (small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma). In the United States, NHL represents 4-5% of all new cancer cases, and is the eighth leading cause of cancer death. According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated in 2018 that there will be 74,680 new cases in the United States, and 19,910 deaths from NHL, despite improvements in treatment. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) affects mainly older adults and accounts for approximately one quarter of all diagnosed cases of leukemia, of which there are estimated to be about 60,300 new cases and about 24,370 deaths (all kinds of leukemia) according to American Cancer Society estimates. Despite improvements in therapy, up to one third of patients with aggressive NHL continue to die from their disease, and indolent lymphomas remain incurable in the absence of allogeneic stem cell transplant. The treatment paradigm for hematologic malignancies is well standardized in front line settings, with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, administered generally in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. While front line therapies are generally efficacious, there are numerous downsides, including a high rate of toxicity associated with exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. While initially responsive, most patients with hematologic malignancies will eventually relapse and require second, third, and sometimes more lines of therapy. As a result, there is a pressing need for new, innovative, targeted therapies for the treatment of this heterogeneous group of diseases.

 Anti-CD20 antibodies have been approved and studied in a variety of diseases falling into several therapeutic areas including oncology, autoimmune disorders, and neurologic disease. NHL and CLL are the most common B-cell proliferative diseases for which rituximab, the first anti-CD20 antibody approved by the FDA, is the current gold standard treatment. While the addition of rituximab to chemotherapeutic treatment of NHL has dramatically improved patient outcomes, many patients will relapse or become refractory to rituximab containing regimens.
  
 Rituximab resistance is becoming an increasing concern for clinicians as relapsing patients are exposed to multiple lines of rituximab containing regimens to treat recurrence of disease. It is estimated that over half of patients initially responsive to their first exposure to rituximab do not respond upon retreatment (Davis et al, 2000).
  
 We believe these factors contribute to an immediate and sustained need for an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that is differentiated and potentially therapeutically superior to the gold standard rituximab in order to extend and enhance CD20 therapy as it stands today.
  
 In addition to anti-CD20 therapy, novel targeted agents are now being introduced which target specific signaling pathways and enzymes known to exhibit aberrant activity and overexpression in B-cell malignancies such as Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), and Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase delta (PI3K delta). The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has been the target of numerous pharmaceutical agents, both approved and in development, however only recently has the delta isoform of PI3K been identified as a potential target for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Idelalisib (ZYDELIG®), a PI3K delta specific inhibitor from Gilead Pharmaceuticals, was approved by the FDA in 2014 for patients with CLL and indolent NHL, and copanlisib (ALIQOPA™) was approved by the FDA in 2017 for patients with advanced follicular lymphoma.. Other agents targeting kinases downstream of the B-cell receptor, such as the BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, have displayed high rates of response in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell malignancies and have been recently approved for indications in lymphoma. While these agents have demonstrated high levels of single agent activity in B-cell disorders, their clinical activity has been shown to be greatly enhanced when utilized in combination with anti-CD20 agents.
  
 As novel targeted agents gain FDA approval for the treatment of relapsed and refractory disease, it is anticipated that the size of this market will expand greatly as branded drugs enter use in multiple lines of therapy. Given the nature of the disease state for patients with hematologic malignancies, characterized by indolent disease progression and chronic relapses, the Company anticipates a great and growing need for novel agents that can be used alone or in combination with approved agents, and those currently under development to enhance the quality of life and extend the length of survival for patients suffering from hematologic malignancies.
  
  IRAK4
  
 Interleukin-1 Receptor Associated Kinase 4, referred to as IRAK4, is a key signaling kinase that becomes inappropriately activated in tumors that carry certain oncogenic mutations of MYD88, which can be found in most patients with Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia, a rare B-cell cancer, as well as in a sub-set of patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. Additionally, IRAK4 is a key component of signaling pathways which regulate immune and inflammatory processes suggesting that inhibition of IRAK4 may also be useful in the treatment of autoimmune related disorders. We hold global rights to develop and commercialize the IRAK4 program, which was licensed from Ligand Pharmaceuticals. Our IRAK4 program is currently in pre-clinical development. In April 2015, we presented pre-clinical data on the IRAK4 compounds at the 2015 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting held in Philadelphia, PA.
  
  PD-L1 and GITR
  
 In March 2015, we entered into a global collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibody research programs in the field of hematological malignancies. Our anti-PD-L1 recently entered the clinic and our anti-GITR program is currently in pre-clinical development, with pre-clinical data most recently presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting in March 2017.
  
  
11


 
 
 In October 2017, we announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of our anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, enrolling patients across sites in Australia and New Zealand. 
  
  BET
  
 In May 2016, as part of a broader agreement with Jubilant Biosys (“Jubilant”), an India-based biotechnology company, we entered into a sub-license agreement (“JBET Agreement”) with Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (“Checkpoint”), a subsidiary of Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“FBIO”), for the development and commercialization of Jubilant’s novel BET inhibitor program in the field of hematological malignancies. The BET inhibitor program is the subject of a family of patents covering compounds that inhibit BRD4, a member of the BET (Bromodomain and Extra Terminal) domain for cancer treatment. Our BET inhibitor program is currently in pre-clinical development. Our Executive Chairman and CEO, is also Executive Vice Chairman of FBIO.
 BTK
  
 In January 2018, we entered into a global exclusive license agreement with Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., or Jiangsu (“BTK Agreement”),  pursuant to which we obtained worldwide rights, excluding Asia but including Japan, for the development of Hengrui's Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor program, including lead candidate TG-1701 (known in China as SHR-1459), as monotherapy and in combination with TG-1101 and TGR-1202. In addition to TG-1701, the global license agreement covers TG-1702 (SHR-1266), another BTK inhibitor in pre-clinical development. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is an essential component of the B-cell receptor signaling pathways that regulate the survival, activation, proliferation, and differentiation of B lymphocytes. Targeting BTK with small molecule inhibitors has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment option for B-cell lymphomas and autoimmune diseases.
 COSTS AND TIME TO COMPLETE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
  
 The information below provides estimates regarding the costs associated with the completion of the current development phase and our current estimated range of the time that will be necessary to complete that development phase for our key pipeline products. We also direct your attention to the risk factors which could significantly affect our ability to meet these cost and time estimates found in this report in Item 1A under the heading “Risks Related to the Company’s Business and Industry.” 
  
  
12


 
 
 
Product candidate | Target indication | Development status | Completion of phase | Estimated cost to complete phase
---------------------+----------------------------------------------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------------------
TG-1101 & TGR-1202 | In combination in CLL patients | Phase III | 2018* | Approximately $7 million 
TGR-1202 +/- TG-1101 | In combination in relapsed/refractory NHL patients | Phase IIb | 2019* | Approximately $10 million 
TG-1101 | In relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis | Phase III | 2021 | Approximately $50 million 


  *Completion of phase for this study indicates completion of portion of study, which, if successful, would support an accelerated approval

 Completion dates and costs in the above table are estimates due to the uncertainties associated with clinical trials and the related requirements of development. In the cases where the requirements for clinical trials and development programs have not been fully defined, or are dependent on the success of other trials, we cannot estimate trial completion or cost with any certainty. The actual spending on each trial during the year is also dependent on funding. We therefore direct your attention to Item 7 under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
  
  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
  
  General
  
 Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries.  Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
  
 We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. This knowledge and experience we call “know-how.”  To help protect our proprietary know-how which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests.  To this end, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
  
 Patents and other proprietary rights are crucial to the development of our business. We will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents, supported by regulatory exclusivity or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We have a number of patents and patent applications related to our compounds and other technology, but we cannot guarantee the scope of protection of the issued patents, or that such patents will survive a validity or enforceability challenge, or that any of the pending patent applications will issue as patents.
  
 Generally, patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy for a period of 18 months or more. Since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we are not certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file those patent applications. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents, or their enforceability. To date, there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents. Third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications, if issued. If our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before we commercialize any of our products, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patent. However, the life of a patent covering a product that has been subject to regulatory approval may have the ability to be extended through the patent restoration program, although any such extension could still be minimal.
  
  
13


 
 
 If a patent is issued to a third party containing one or more preclusive or conflicting claims, and those claims are ultimately determined to be valid and enforceable, we may be required to obtain a license under such patent or to develop or obtain alternative technology. In the event of litigation involving a third party claim, an adverse outcome in the litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to such third party, require us to seek a license for the disputed rights from such third party, and/or require us to cease use of the technology. Further, our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to technology required to commercialize our products may seriously harm our business. We also may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Litigation would involve substantial costs.
  
  TG-1101
  
 Pursuant to our license for TG-1101 (ublituximab) with LFB Biotechnologies, GTC Biotherapeutics, and LFB/GTC LLC, we have the exclusive commercial rights to a series of patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in multiple countries around the world, as well as a non-exclusive license to additional background patent rights.  These patents and patent protections include composition of matter patents relating to the structure and mechanism of action for TG-1101 as well as method of use patents which cover use of TG-1101 in combination with various agents and for various therapeutic indications.
  
 The composition of matter patent for TG-1101 has been issued in the United States and Europe, which affords patent protection until 2029 in the US and 2025 in Europe, exclusive of patent term extensions. We also have a method of use patent on the combination of TGR-1202 and TG-1101 which has been issued in the United States and is pending in other territories globally. Additionally, we have numerous granted patents and pedning patent applications outside the US which include claims directed to the composition of matter and methods of treatment with TG-1101 in various settings.
  
  TGR-1202
  
 Pursuant to our license for TGR-1202 with Rhizen, we have the exclusive commercial rights to a series of patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. The patent applications include composition of matter patents relating to the structure, mechanism of action, and formulation for TGR-1202 as well as method of use patents which cover use of TGR-1202 in combination with various agents and for various therapeutic indications. Our composition of matter patent for TGR-1202 has been issued in the United States and Europe, which affords patent protection until 2033, exclusive of patent term extensions. We also have a method of use patent on the combination of TGR-1202 and TG-1101 which has been issued in the United States and is pending in other territories globally. All other patent applications currently filed for TG-1202 are currently pending. Because the dates for any potential regulatory approval are currently unknown we cannot predict the expected expiration date, and it is possible that the life of these patents following regulatory approval could be minimal.
  
  IRAK4
  
 Pursuant to our license for the IRAK4 program with Ligand, we have the exclusive commercial rights to a patent family which covers the composition of matter and proposed methods of use for various therapeutic indications. All patent applications currently filed for the IRAK4 program are currently pending. Because the date for any potential regulatory approval is currently unknown we cannot predict the expected expiration date, and it is possible that the life of these patents following regulatory approval could be minimal.
  
  PD-L1 and GITR
  
 Pursuant to our Global Collaboration with Checkpoint, the intellectual property includes issued patents in a number of countries, including the United States and Europe, as well as pending patent applications in several countries elsewhere.  The PD-L1 segment of the portfolio includes patent applications pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Israel and Korea.  Any patents maturing from these pending applications will expire no sooner than October 2033.  The GITR segment of the portfolio includes an International Application No. PCT/US2015/054010, filed in October 2015. Any national stage applications, which are pursued off of this international application (including one in the United States Patent and Trademark Office), would expire no earlier than October 2035.
  
  
14


 
 
  BET
  
 Pursuant to our JBET Agreement with Checkpoint, the in-licensed patent estate includes two international (PCT) applications filed in March 2016 (WO 2016/157221) and September 2016, respectively, claiming the benefit of two earlier-filed Indian provisional applications. Any patents maturing from this patent estate are expected to expire no sooner than March 2036.
 BTK
  
 Pursuant to our BTK Agreement with Jiangsu, we have the exclusive commercial rights to a patent family which covers the composition of matter and proposed methods of use for various therapeutic indications. All patent applications currently filed for the BTK program are currently pending. Because the date for any potential regulatory approval is currently unknown we cannot predict the expected expiration date, and it is possible that the life of these patents following regulatory approval could be minimal.
  
 The patent rights that we own or have licensed relating to our product candidates are limited in ways that may affect our ability to exclude third parties from competing against us if we obtain regulatory approval to market these product candidates. See “Item 1A – Risk Factors -- Risks Related to the Company’s Intellectual Property.”
  
 Proof of direct infringement by a competitor for method of use patents can prove difficult because the competitors making and marketing a product typically do not engage in the patented use. Additionally, proof that a competitor contributes to or induces infringement of a patented method of use by another can also prove difficult because an off-label use of a product could prohibit a finding of contributory infringement and inducement of infringement requires proof of intent by the competitor.
  
 Moreover, physicians may prescribe such a competitive identical product for indications other than the one for which the product has been approved, or off-label indications, that are covered by the applicable patents. Although such off-label prescriptions may directly infringe or contribute to or induce infringement of method of use patents, such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.
  
 In addition, the limited patent protection described above may adversely affect the value of our product candidates and may inhibit our ability to obtain a corporate partner at terms acceptable to us, if at all.
  
  Other Intellectual Property Rights
  
 We depend upon trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. To maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we require our employees, scientific advisors, consultants and collaborators, upon commencement of a relationship with us, to execute confidentiality agreements and, in the case of parties other than our research and development collaborators, to agree to assign their inventions to us. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed in connection with their relationship with us. These agreements may not, however, provide protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.
  
  
15


 
 
 In addition to patent protection, we may utilize orphan drug regulations or other provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended, or FDCA, to provide market exclusivity for certain of our drug candidates. Orphan drug regulations provide incentives to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases, currently defined as diseases that exist in fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or, diseases that affect more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. but that the sponsor does not realistically anticipate will generate a net profit. Under these provisions, a manufacturer of a designated orphan-drug can seek tax benefits, and the holder of the first FDA approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity for such FDA-approved orphan product.
  
 Pursuant to these regulations, TG-1101 (ublituximab) has received Orphan-Drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of Marginal Zone Lymphoma (Nodal and Extranodal) in September 2013, for the treatment of CLL in August of 2010, and Orphan-Drug designation by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the treatment of CLL in November of 2009. We also obtained Orphan Drug designation for TGR-1202 as monotherapy for the treatment of CLL in August 2016, and in January 2017, we announced that the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation covering the combination of TG-1101 and TGR-1202 for the treatment of patients with CLL and DLBCL. We believe that TG-1101 and TGR-1202, as well as our other pipeline productsmay be eligible for additional Orphan Drug designations; however, we cannot assure you that TG-1101, TGR-1202, or any other drug candidates we may acquire or in-license, will obtain such orphan drug designations. Additionally, upon FDA approval, we believe that TG-1101 and TGR-1202 each would qualify as a New Chemical Entity, or NCE, which provides for five years of exclusivity following approval.
  
 We cannot assure you that any other drug candidates we may acquire or in-license, will obtain such Orphan Drug designation or that we will be the first to receive FDA approval for such drugs so as to be eligible for market exclusivity protection.
  
  LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND COLLABORATIONS
 
 We have formed strategic alliances with a number of companies for the manufacture and commercialization of our products. Our current key strategic alliances are discussed below.

  TGR-1202
  
 In September 2014, we exercised our option to license the global rights to TGR-1202, thereby entering into an exclusive licensing agreement (the “TGR-1202 License”) with Rhizen Pharmaceuticals, S A (“Rhizen”) for the development and commercialization of TGR-1202. Prior to this, we had been jointly developing TGR-1202 in a 50:50 joint venture with Rhizen.
  
 Under the terms of the TGR-1202 License, Rhizen received a $4.0 million cash payment and 371,530 shares of our common stock as an upfront license fee. With respect to TGR-1202, Rhizen will be eligible to receive regulatory filing, approval and sales based milestone payments in the aggregate of approximately $175 million, a small portion of which will be payable on the first New Drug Application (NDA) filing and the remainder on approval in multiple jurisdictions for up to two oncology indications and one non-oncology indication and attaining certain sales milestones. In addition, if TGR-1202 is co-formulated with another drug to create a new product (a "New Product"), Rhizen will be eligible to receive similar regulatory approval and sales based milestone payments for such New Product. Additionally, Rhizen will be entitled to tiered royalties that escalate from high single digits to low double digits on our future net sales of TGR-1202 and any New Product. In lieu of sales milestones and royalties on net sales, Rhizen shall also be eligible to participate in sublicensing revenue, if any, based on a percentage that decreases as a function of the number of patients treated in clinical trials following the exercise of the license option. Rhizen will retain global manufacturing rights to TGR-1202, provided that they are price competitive with alternative manufacturers. The license will terminate on a country by country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right or any other exclusivity right in such country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated (i) by us for any reason, (ii) by either party due to a breach of the agreement.
  
  IRAK4
  In June 2014, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated ("Ligand") for the development and commercialization of Ligand's interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase-4 ("IRAK4") inhibitor technology, which currently is in preclinical development for potential use against certain cancers and autoimmune diseases. IRAK4 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a key downstream signaling component of the interleukin-1 receptor and multiple toll-like receptors.
  
 Under the terms of the license agreement, Ligand received 125,000 shares of our common stock as an upfront license fee. Ligand will also be eligible to receive maximum potential milestone payments of approximately $207 million upon the achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone events. Additionally, Ligand will be entitled to royalties on our future net sales of licensed products containing IRAK4 inhibitors. The basic royalty rate for licensed products covered by Ligand's issued patents will be 6% for annual sales of up to $1 billion and 9.5% for annual sales in excess of that threshold. The license will terminate on a country by country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right or 10 years after the first commercial sale of a product in such country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated by either party due to a breach of the agreement in the event of the insolvency of the other party.
  
  
17


 
 
  PD-L1 and GITR
  
 In March 2015, we entered into a Global Collaboration (the “Collaboration”) with Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (“Checkpoint”), a subsidiary of FBIO for the development and commercialization of Checkpoint’s anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibody research programs in the field of hematological malignancies.
 
 Under the terms of the Collaboration, we made an up-front payment of $500,000, will make development and sales-based milestone payments up to an aggregate of $164 million, and will pay a tiered single digit royalty on net sales. The royalty term will terminate on a country by country basis upon the later of (i) ten years after the first commercial sale of any applicable licensed product in such country, or (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire patent held by Dana Farber containing a valid claim to any licensed product in such country.
  
  BET
  
 In May 2016, as part of a broader agreement with Jubilant Biosys (“Jubilant”), an India-based biotechnology company, we entered into a sub-license agreement (“JBET Agreement”) with Checkpoint for the development and commercialization of Jubilant’s novel BET inhibitor program in the field of hematological malignancies. The BET inhibitor program is the subject of a family of patents covering compounds that inhibit BRD4, a member of the BET (Bromodomain and Extra Terminal) domain for cancer treatment. Our BET inhibitor program is currently in pre-clinical development.
  
 Under the terms of the agreement, we paid Checkpoint an up-front licensing fee of $1.0 million and will make additional payments contingent on certain preclinical, clinical, and regulatory milestones, including commercial milestones totaling up to approximately $177 million and a single-digit royalty on net sales.  TG will also provide funding to support certain targeted research efforts at Jubilant.
  
  BTK
  
 In January 2018, we entered into a global exclusive license agreement with Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., or Jiangsu, to acquire worldwide intellectual property rights, excluding Asia but including Japan, and for the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of products containing or comprising of any of Jiangsu’s Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors containing the compounds of either TG-1701 (SHR-1459 or EBI-1459) or TG-1702 (SHR-1266 or EBI-1266). Pursuant to the agreement, we paid Jiangsu an upfront fee of $1.0 million in our common stock. Jiangsu is eligible to receive milestone payments totaling approximately $350 million upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones. Various provisions allow for payments in conjunction with the agreement to be made in cash or our common stock, while others limit the form of payment. Royalty payments in the low double digits are due on net sales of licensed products and revenue from sublicenses. Additionally, before we can license, sell, develop, or commercialize ublituximab (TG-1101) within China, we must notify Jiangsu, giving Jiangsu the right of first offer.
  
 The term of the agreement expires after the expiration of the last royalty term to expire with respect to any of the patent rights under the agreement. We or Jiangsu may terminate the agreement upon notice to the other upon breach without remedy or upon insolvency. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach, after providing the other party with adequate notice and allowing 45 days to cure.
  
  COMPETITION
  
 Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel, attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and license technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors.
  
  
18


 
 
 The drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. Other companies have products or drug candidates in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical development to treat diseases for which we are also seeking to discover and develop drug candidates. Some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our drug candidates and may be commercialized earlier.
  
 If approved, we expect TG-1101 to compete directly with Roche Group’s Rituxan® (rituximab) and Gazyva® (obinutuzumab or GA-101), and Novartis’ Arzerra® (ofatumumab) among others, each of which is currently approved for the treatment of various diseases including NHL and CLL. In addition, a number of pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies targeting CD20, CD19, and other B-cell associated targets, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy, and other B-cell ablative therapy which, if approved, would potentially compete with TG-1101 both in oncology settings as well as in autoimmune disorders. Earlier this year, the Roche Group’s anti-CD20 antibody ocrelizumab was approved for the treatment of MS. Genmab and GSK’s (ofatumumab) is also under clinical development for patients with MS. New developments, including the development of other pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. 
  
 With respect to TGR-1202, there are several PI3K delta targeted compounds both approved, such as Gilead’s Zydelig® (idelalisib) and Bayer’s Aliqopa™ (copanlisib), and in development, including, but not limited to, Verastem’s duvelisib which if approved we would expect to compete directly with TGR-1202. In addition, there are numerous other novel therapies targeting similar pathways to TGR-1202 both approved and in development, which could also compete with TGR-1202 in similar indications, such as the BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib (FDA approved for MCL, CLL, Marginal Zone Lymphoma and WM and marketed by AbbVie and Janssen), the BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib (FDA approved for MCL and marketed by AstraZeneca), or the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax (FDA approved for CLL and marketed by AbbVie and Roche).

  SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING
  
 We have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes. We currently do not have any manufacturing capabilities. We have established contract manufacturing relationships for the supply of TG-1101 as part of our license agreement with LFB Biotechnologies and also with a U.S. based contract manufacturer. We have also established contract manufacturing relationships for the supply of TGR-1202 as part of our licensing agreement with Rhizen. As with any supply program, obtaining pre-clinical and clinical materials of sufficient quality and quantity to meet the requirements of our development programs cannot be guaranteed and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in this endeavor. In addition, we anticipate the need for the current scale of production for each of our products to be significantly expanded as we enter later stages of development. There can be no assurance given that such scale-up will be successful in providing pharmaceutical product that is of sufficient quantity, or of a quality that is consistent with our previously established specifications, or that meets the requirements set by regulatory agencies under which we may seek approval of our product candidates.
  
 At the time of commercial sale, to the extent possible and commercially practicable, we would seek to engage a back-up supplier for each of our product candidates. Until such time, we expect that we will rely on a single contract manufacturer to produce each of our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations. Our third-party manufacturers have a limited number of facilities in which our product candidates can be produced and will have limited experience in manufacturing our product candidates in quantities sufficient for commercialization. Our third-party manufacturers will have other clients and may have other priorities that could affect their ability to perform the work satisfactorily and/or on a timely basis. Both of these occurrences would be beyond our control. 
  
  
19


 
 
 We expect to similarly rely on contract manufacturing relationships for any products that we may in-license or acquire in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contract with such manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
  
 Contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other state and federal regulations. Our contractors outside of the United States face similar challenges from the numerous local and regional agencies and authorized bodies. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards, other than through contractual obligations. If they are deemed out of compliance with cGMPs, product recalls could result, inventory could be destroyed, production could be stopped and supplies could be delayed or otherwise disrupted.
  
 If we need to change manufacturers after commercialization, the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these new manufacturers in advance, which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with FDA regulations and standards and may require significant lead times and delay. Furthermore, switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
  
  GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATION
  
 Numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies, impose substantial regulations upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of our drug candidates, as well as our ongoing research and development activities. None of our drug candidates have been approved for sale in any market in which we have marketing rights. Before marketing in the U.S., any drug that we develop must undergo rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the FDCA. The FDA regulates, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, approval, manufacturing, record keeping, adverse event reporting, packaging, labeling, storage, advertising, promotion, export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products.
  
 The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. We are required to submit extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication or use to establish a drug candidate’s safety and efficacy before we can secure FDA approval to market or sell a product in the U.S. The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies or surveillance. Before commencing clinical trials in humans, we must submit an IND to the FDA containing, among other things, pre-clinical data, chemistry, manufacturing and control information, and an investigative plan. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
  
 The FDA may permit expedited development, evaluation, and marketing of new therapies intended to treat persons with serious or life-threatening conditions for which there is an unmet medical need under its fast track drug development programs. A sponsor can apply for fast track designation at the time of submission of an IND, or at any time prior to receiving marketing approval of the new drug application, or NDA. To receive Fast Track designation, an applicant must demonstrate:
  
  ●
  that the drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition;

 
  ●
  that the drug is intended to treat a serious aspect of the condition; and


  ●
  that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs, and this potential is being evaluated in the planned drug development program.

 
  
20


 
 
 The FDA must respond to a request for fast track designation within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Over the course of drug development, a product in a fast track development program must continue to meet the criteria for fast track designation. Sponsors of products in fast track drug development programs must be in regular contact with the reviewing division of the FDA to ensure that the evidence necessary to support marketing approval will be developed and presented in a format conducive to an efficient review. Sponsors of products in fast track drug development programs ordinarily are eligible for priority review of a completed application in six months or less and also may be permitted to submit portions of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the FDA for review before the complete application is submitted.
  
 Sponsors of drugs designated as fast track also may seek approval under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations. Under this authority, the FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence, to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. Approval will be subject to the requirement that the applicant study the drug further to verify and describe its clinical benefit where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate endpoint to clinical benefit or uncertainty as to the relation of the observed clinical benefit to ultimate outcome.  Post-marketing studies are usually underway at the time an applicant files the NDA.  When required to be conducted, such post-marketing studies must also be adequate and well-controlled.  The applicant must carry out any such post-marketing studies with due diligence. Many companies who have been granted the right to utilize an accelerated approval approach have failed to obtain approval. Moreover, negative or inconclusive results from the clinical trials we hope to conduct or adverse medical events could cause us to have to repeat or terminate the clinical trials. Accordingly, we may not be able to complete the clinical trials within an acceptable time frame, if at all, and, therefore, could not submit the NDA to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for marketing approval.
  
 In addition, sponsors may also apply to the FDA for Breakthrough Therapy Designation. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a potential new drug for serious or life-threatening diseases where “preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.” The designation of a drug as a Breakthrough Therapy was enacted as part of the 2012 Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act.
  
 Clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices, and must be conducted pursuant to an IND, unless exempted.
  
 For purposes of NDA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases:
  
  ●
  Phase 1 : The drug is administered to a small group of humans, either healthy volunteers or patients, to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, excretion, and clinical pharmacology.

 
  ●
  Phase 2 : Studies are conducted on a larger number of patients to assess the efficacy of the product, to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse events.

 
  ●
  Phase 3 : Studies establish safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population.

 
  ●
  Phase 4 : The FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to find out more about the drug’s long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use, or to test the drug in different populations.

 The length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or that may increase the costs of these trials, include:
  
  ●
  slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors;

 
  ●
  inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials or delays in approvals from a study site’s review board;

 
  ●
  longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy or determine the appropriate product dose;

 
  ●
  insufficient supply of the drug candidates;

 
  ●
  adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and

 
  ●
  ineffectiveness of the drug candidates.

 
 In addition, the FDA, equivalent foreign regulatory authority, or a data safety monitoring committee for a trial may place a clinical trial on hold or terminate it if it concludes that subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, or for futility. Any drug is likely to produce some toxicity or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for a sufficiently long period of time. Unacceptable toxicity or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a drug candidate, known as toxicological studies, or clinical trials of drug candidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our drug candidates and could ultimately prevent approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.
  
 Sponsors of drugs may apply for an SPA from the FDA. The SPA process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to form the basis for a new drug application. However, final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the Phase 3 trial. The SPA agreement may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product safety or efficacy.
  
 Before receiving FDA approval to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for its intended use by submitting to the FDA an NDA or BLA containing the pre-clinical and clinical data that have been accumulated, together with chemistry and manufacturing and controls specifications and information, and proposed labeling, among other things. The FDA may refuse to accept an NDA/BLA for filing if certain content criteria are not met and, even after accepting an NDA/BLA, the FDA may often require additional information, including clinical data, before approval of marketing a product.
  
 It is also becoming more common for the FDA to request a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as part of a NDA/BLA. The REMS plan contains post-market obligations of the sponsor to train prescribing physicians, monitor off-label drug use, and conduct sufficient Phase 4 follow-up studies and registries to ensure the continued safe use of the drug.

 As part of the approval process, the FDA must inspect and approve each manufacturing facility. Among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. Manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort to ensure continued compliance, and the FDA conducts periodic inspections to certify compliance. It may be difficult for our manufacturers or us to comply with the applicable cGMP, as interpreted by the FDA, and other FDA regulatory requirements. If we, or our contract manufacturers, fail to comply, then the FDA may not allow us to market products that have been affected by the failure.
  
 If the FDA grants approval, the approval will be limited to those disease states, conditions and patient populations for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies. Further, a product may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved in the NDA/BLA. Certain changes to an approved NDA/BLA, including, with certain exceptions, any significant changes to labeling, require approval of a supplemental application before the drug may be marketed as changed. Any products that we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing monitoring and regulation by the FDA, including compliance with cGMP and the reporting of adverse experiences with the drugs. The nature of marketing claims that the FDA will permit us to make in the labeling and advertising of our products will generally be limited to those specified in FDA approved labeling, and the advertising of our products will be subject to comprehensive monitoring and regulation by the FDA. Drugs whose review was accelerated may carry additional restrictions on marketing activities, including the requirement that all promotional materials are pre-submitted to the FDA. Claims exceeding those contained in approved labeling will constitute a violation of the FDCA. Violations of the FDCA or regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or marketing and sale following approval may result in agency enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, recall, seizure of products, warning letters, injunctions, fines and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.
  
 Should we wish to market our products outside the U.S., we must receive marketing authorization from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, companies are typically required to apply for foreign marketing authorizations at a national level. However, within the European Union, registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one European Union member state. Typically, if the regulatory authority is satisfied that a company has presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy, then the regulatory authority will grant a marketing authorization. This foreign regulatory approval process, however, involves risks similar or identical to the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above, and therefore we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the appropriate marketing authorization for any product in any particular country.
  
 Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of new drugs are subject to future changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, effect or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
  
  EMPLOYEES
  
 As of March 1, 2018, we had 75 full and part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
