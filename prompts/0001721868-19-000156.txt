ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
----------------------------------+----------

Background
 
ALR TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (the “Company” or “ALRT”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 24, 1987 as Mo Betta Corp. In April 1998, the Company changed its business purpose to marketing a pharmaceutical compliance device.
 
In December 1998, the common shares of the Company began trading on the Bulletin Board operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc. under the symbol “MBET.” On December 28, 1998, the Company changed its name from Mo Betta Corp. to ALR Technologies Inc. Subsequently the symbol was changed to “ALRT.”
 
On April 15, 2008, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in Canada under the name Canada ALRTech Health Systems Inc. This inactive subsidiary was dissolved on October 4, 2016. Accordingly, ALRTech Health Systems Inc. has been deconsolidated from such date.
 
In late 2011, the Company relocated its headquarters to 7400 Beaufont Springs Drive, Suite 300, Richmond, Virginia, 23225.
 
During 2011, the Company received FDA clearance and achieved HIPPA compliance for its Diabetes Management System. With these key achievements and successful clinical trials completed, the Company began implementing its commercialization strategy which included a pilot program with patients in Kansas in 2014. The Company obtained significant findings from this pilot program which led to the development of its Insulin Dosage Adjustment, for which it received FDA clearance in 2017, and Predictive A1C, for which it has submitted for worldwide patent application under the patent cooperation treaty to the World Intellectual Property Organization. The Company is actively seeking to commence revenue generating activities.

Products
 
ALR Technologies products utilize internet-based technologies to facilitate healthcare provider’s ability to monitor their patient’s health and ensure adherence to health maintenance activities.
 
The ALRT Diabetes Management System is a remote monitoring and care facilitation program that allows patients to upload the blood glucose data from their glucometers. ALRT Health Data Monitors monitor that data and, based on clinician approved protocols, provide advice, support and interventions when patients show blood glucose readings that are out of an acceptable range or if they are failing to test their blood glucose as prescribed. The ALRT System has been successfully proven in a clinical trial that demonstrated this type of remote care is associated with significant lowering of A1c levels. The study concluded that continuing intervention using an internet-based glucose monitoring system is an effective way of improving glucose control compared to conventional care. A second clinical trial demonstrated that this type of Internet-based Blood Glucose Monitoring System (IBGMS) was associated with comparable reductions in A1c levels with that of more expensive Continuing Glucose Monitoring Systems (CGMS).
 
In the future, the Company may seek to adapt its System to be used in the management of other chronic diseases. The Company may be required to obtain additional clearance from the FDA prior to commencing selling activities in the United States for other disease states.
 
ALRT Diabetes Management System for Diabetes Monitoring
 
Diabetes is a leading cause of death, serious illness and disability across North America. In the United States, it is estimated that 26 million people have diabetes, with 4.5 million people being classified as insulin dependent. By the year 2030, it is expected that 1 in 10 adults, globally, will have diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed instances). By the year 2050, it is expected that 1 in 3 United States adults will have diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed instances). We believe diabetes is a global pandemic.
 
As a result, medical costs due to diabetes and its complications are enormous. In the United States, such costs are estimated to be over $245 billion a year. In Canada, where it is estimated there are 2 million people with diabetes, healthcare costs associated with diabetes is estimated to be more than $13 billion annually.
 
Diabetes is a lifelong chronic disease with no cure. However, people with diabetes can take steps to control their disease and reduce the risk of developing the associated serious complications, thereby controlling healthcare costs. The Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Guidelines Expert Committee reports that “Successful diabetes care depends on the daily commitment of persons with diabetes mellitus to self-manage through the balance of lifestyle and medication. Diabetes care should be organized around a multi- and interdisciplinary diabetes healthcare team that can establish and sustain a communication network between the person with diabetes and the necessary healthcare and community systems.”
 
However, as noted in Patrick Connole, “UnitedHealthcare, Other Large Insurers Seek Better Adherence to Diabetes Care”, Health Plan Week, February 11, 2013 Volume 23 Issue 5, 80% of United States patients with diabetes do not follow their prescribed care plan.
 
Furthermore, in Treatment intensification for patients with type 2 diabetes and poor glycaemic control by Fu and Sheenan, it was noted that out 11,525 patients investigated with an A1c greater than 8% patients received intensification as follows:


37% within 6 months;
11% within 6-12 months, and
52% never

ALRT Diabetes Management System (continued)
 A study in 2013 by Khunti, Wolden, Thorstead, Anderson and Davies entitled Clinical inertia in people with type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study of more than 80,000 people found that patients it took on average 19 months to escalate patients with an average A1c of 8.7% from single medication to dual therapy and 82 months to escalate patients with an average A1c of 8.8% from dual medication to triple therapy. Furthermore, they found that it took approximately 20 years to advance patients with an average A1c of over 9% to insulin. At the end of the study, less than 50% of the patients had their treatment intensified. 
 
The Company’s Diabetes Management System provides an affordable and easy to use tool to provide the communication network as recommended by the Committee. Our Diabetes Management System includes a communications software platform that also enables health professionals to remotely monitor the health progress to patients with diabetes. This facilitates more timely and effective communication and coordination of care to these patients. This also results in positive behavior patterning, or re-patterning, of the patients.
 
The Diabetes Management System and the Company’s universal upload cable, are compatible with the majority of the major brands of glucose meters available for sale in the United States.
 
In August 2010, the Company received the results of a clinical trial conducted by Dr. Hugh Tildesley using the ALRT Health-e-Connect System. The trial showed A1c dropping from 8.8% to 7.6% for the Intervention Group using ALRT’s Health-e-Connect System as part of a diabetes management program. The A1c test is important in diabetes treatment management as a long-term measure of control over blood glucose for diabetes patients. According to Center for Disease Control and Prevention, “In general, every percentage drop in A1c blood test results (e.g. from 8% to 7%), can reduce the risk of microvascular complications (eye, kidney and nerve diseases) by 40%.” The trial served as the basis for an article titled “Effect of Internet Therapeutic Intervention on A1c Levels in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Treated with Insulin” was published in the August 2010 Diabetes Care publication.
 
In July 2011, the follow-up results of the Dr. Tildesley clinical trial were published in the Canadian Journal of Diabetes. Dr. Tildesley conducted a 12-month study using Health-e-Connect System as an Internet Based Blood Glucose Monitoring System (IBGMS) to provide intensive blood glucose control to determine the effects of internet-based blood glucose monitoring on A1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin. Dr Tildesley concluded that, “While IBGMS intervention was not a substitute for the patient–physician interaction in a clinical setting, it significantly improved A1c and, over time, we observed better glycemic control and patient satisfaction.”
 
In October 2011, the Company received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Diabetes Management System (then known as the Health-e-Connect System) for remote monitoring of patients in support of effective diabetes management programs. The 510(k) clearance enables the Company to commence with the United States marketing and sales launch of its Health-e-Connect System.
 
On July 28, 2014, the Company entered into a pilot service agreement with Kansas City Metropolitan Physician Association (KCMPA), one of the nation's premier Accountable Care Organizations (ACO). Under the agreement, KCMPA, which made diabetes management a key focus of its Quality Improvement Plan, enrolled up to 200 of its patients with Type 2 diabetes into ALRT's Diabetes Management System. The pilot service agreement was effective nine months from the beginning date of patient enrollment and the intent was to allow 6 months of use for each patient enrolled in the system. The pilot program between ALRT and KCMPA represented the first commercial deployment of ALRT's Diabetes Management System. On September 9, 2014, the Company began enrolling patients with Type 2 diabetes and A1c levels above 8 percent into the pilot program trialing the Diabetes Management System.

ALRT Diabetes Management System (continued)
 
In September 2014, the Company initiated its pilot program with one of the Kansas City Metropolitan Physician Association clinics to deploy its Diabetes Management System for up to 200 patients that fit certain criteria. As a result of the pilot program findings and general industry trends, the Company proceeded with developing three new innovations: 
 
· | Insulin Dosage Adjustment uses both American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) guidelines for adjusting insulin, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Predictive A1c, which converts blood glucose data uploaded into our Diabetes Management Systems and converts the large amount of data into a predicted or simulated A1C 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Diabetes Therapy Review allows the healthcare providers to change care plans for patients on a timely basis based on the results of Predictive A1c and overall how patients are managing their diabetes 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On January 1, 2015, the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services began reimbursing physicians for the non-face-to-face management of Medicare patients with two or more serious chronic diseases. Physicians would be paid a per-patient-per-month fee for “Chronic Care Management” and the examination of data from a remote monitoring platform is considered a reimbursable activity by CMS. Therefore, the Company modified its System to conform to the requirements of the CMS reimbursement. These modifications permit the Company to market to medical groups throughout the United States with a product that will help physicians to draw down this new reimbursement as well as to potentially improve the outcomes of their patients.
 On February 18, 2015, the Company filed a 510(k) application with the FDA to add a remote insulin dosing recommendation feature to the Company’s Diabetes Management System. The Company utilized the publicly available algorithm of the AACE & ADA. This feature allows the Company to regularly run a patient’s blood glucose data (and other key data) through the AACE and ADA algorithm. When the algorithm indicated that the patient’s dose may not be optimal, the Diabetes Management System would provide the healthcare provider that a dose change may be warranted and what the change would be based on AACE and ADA guidelines. The decision about the dose change would rest entirely with the healthcare provider. However, this new feature may make a significant contribution to improving the outcomes of diabetes patients if it allowed healthcare provider to keep their patients at the optimal dose for longer periods.
 Preliminary data from the KCMPA pilot program indicated that a number of patients had achieved reductions in their A1c levels. On April 17, 2015, the Company signed a commercial contract with one of the KCMPA clinics, the Clay-Platte Family Medicine Clinic, to provide remote monitoring services. The Company has provided these services to date to Clay-Platte at no charge as it has provided the Company with continuous users as a sample population for its own strategic planning and business plan. The Company continues to actively provide services to Clay-Platte for certain of its patients.
 
On June 20, 2017, the Company filed a worldwide patent application under the PCT for its Predictive A1c feature to the World Intellectual Property Office.
 
On September 18, 2017, the Company received clearance from the FDA for its Insulin Dosage Adjustment feature within the Company’s Diabetes Management System.

Potential Benefits of ALRT Diabetes Management System
 
Our Diabetes Management System resolves the expensive and complex care requirements with diabetes by taking a unique approach. While the science of diabetes care is well established and understood, there are disconnects in applying theory into practice. Our System is designed to connect the gap between the theory and practice of diabetes care. We believe the main gaps between theory and practice are:

Type
2 diabetes patients are well known for non-adherence to care plans; however, central to conventional diabetes care is patient
self-management. A natural contradiction.
From
review of published papers, we came to the conclusion that healthcare providers are also responsible for unacceptable outcomes
in diabetes care.

 
However, the challenges faced by healthcare providers are not related to their ability, rather:
 

they
face a lack of timely and reliable blood glucose data, resulting in delays to advance therapy and sub-optimal insulin dosing.
when
reliable blood glucose data is available, there is "too much information" for a healthcare provider to analyse in a
15-minute clinical visit.

 
Based on our clinical trials and pilot, the platform will improve patient outcomes and with the new features will be able to track performance of the healthcare providers as well as patients. Patients utilizing the ALRT Diabetes Management System can realize many benefits. They can expect:
 
· | More timely health care provider attention and action to existing or developing health conditions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Maximization of benefits from health management activities and medication. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved health outlook. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 Health care providers can expect:
 

· | More timely access to patient blood glucose data and trends 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Better understanding of factors that affect patient condition and efficacy of prescribed health management program. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increased ability to influence patient compliance behavior. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Higher reimbursements resulting from better documentation of post-consultation health care services and potential improvements in diabetes quality scores 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Employer, Insurers, and other entities that help manage patient’s health also benefit when their health care providers or patients use the ALRT Diabetes Management System from:
 

· | Improved health outlook for high cost diabetes patients. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Healthier and more productive employees. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduced number of claims and claims amounts for redundant or ineffective health management activities and medication. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Regular monitoring, supervision, and disease-related information provided to high-cost patients. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | More effective wellness and disease management programs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ability to base co-pay amount or premium amount on level of compliance. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our system monitors compliance of disease management activities, such as treatments, medications and diagnostic tests, alerts designated parties when a patient is noncompliant. Our system also facilitates intervention if the patient is deemed at-risk. Often, physicians and caregivers do not detect noncompliance until the next medical appointment when a patient comes to the clinic. We believe more timely intervention should result in substantial health benefits to the patient and significant cost savings. The ongoing monitoring of compliance data will also allow for evaluation of compliance behavior over time, resulting in behavior modification or education efforts when appropriate.

Potential Benefits of ALRT Diabetes Management System (continued)
 
Industry data indicates that 50% or more of people on medications do not take them as prescribed, and that this non-compliance contributes to 10% of hospitalizations and billions of dollars spent annually in excessive and preventable healthcare costs. Reminding a person to take an action is the first step in our system; monitoring their actions and their data is the second and intervention when needed is the important follow-up.
 
With a specific focus on diabetes treatment plans, a recent study from the Temple University School of Pharmacy indicates that the U.S. could save over $9 billion annually by improving patient adherence. Currently, there is inadequate oversight around the buying, selling and appropriate use of diabetes self-glucose testing supplies. Attempts at oversight are fragmented, primarily paper-based, and rely on unverifiable patient reporting. We feel that policies requiring electronic verification of test supply utilization prior to providing refills of test strips, will improve accountability. The ALRT Diabetes Management System has the capability to monitor and document the results of testing to verify that accountability.
 
We believe the ALRT Diabetes Management System can provide solutions to overcome numerous obstacles and inefficiencies in the healthcare system, potentially saving the United States billions of dollars while providing improved healthcare levels, as measured by A1c, for its citizens.
 
Reimbursement for Health Professionals
 
The Company continues to work to obtain confirmation that the Diabetes Management System will allow for services to be provided by physicians that will be reimbursed by health insurance companies. The reimbursement will be a breakthrough as physicians will be paid to provide these important new services to their patients with chronic conditions.
Business Development and Marketing Strategy
 
The Company is focusing the majority of its efforts in introducing and marketing its Health-e-Connect System for medical clinics and health professionals to provide direct care to patients and be reimbursed by the patients’ health benefit plans as well as to employers due to the significant return on investment they can achieve by keeping employees/plan members healthy.
 
The Company is first targeting customers located in United States because of the large market potential but will also seek to obtain regulatory clearance and establish selling operations/agreements for sales and distribution in Canada, Europe, Australia and selected countries in Asia and South America.
 
Other Products
 
The Company’s main product is its Diabetes Management System.
 
Selling Activities
 
The Company is actively seeking alliances with health care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, insulin providers and other health care companies that can act as catalysts to effect positive change for containing health care costs and improving health outcomes. We will work with these types of organizations to introduce the ALRT Diabetes Management System to their network and seek to start significant pilot projects that will lead to revenue generating arrangements.
Manufacturers
 
The Company does not have any designated manufacturers at this time.

Competition
 
The Company competes with other corporations that produce diabetes compliance devices and monitoring systems, some of whom have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. A few companies currently offer compliance monitoring systems but either a) at much higher prices b) have fewer benefits than our system or c) they do not have FDA clearance. The Company’s competition includes, but is not limited to, Glooko, WellDoc, Medtronics, iGlucose and Microsoft HealthVault.
 
We feel none of these companies currently offer a comprehensive compliance system that offers the full spectrum of benefits and features that our Diabetes Management System does with the potential cost efficiencies.
 
Employees and Independent Contractors
 
The Company has no employees and 17 personnel under independent contractor and consulting arrangements. The consultants of the Company have contracts which outline their roles and responsibilities as independent contractor, as well as outlines the confidentiality requirements for all matters pertaining to the Company.
Recent Developments 
 
On January 15, 2016, the Company announced that it has not been successful in finding follow on financing and accordingly reduced its operating budget by reducing its United States based sales and marketing program and diabetes care facilitation workforce. On January 31, 2016, the Company received the resignation of Mr. William Smith from the positions of President and member of the Board of Directors of the Company.

On June 21, 2016, the Company accepted a proposal from Sidney Chan, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, to amend the existing credit agreement between the two parties to increase the borrowing limit on the line of credit provided to the Company from $7,000,000 to $8,500,000. All other terms and conditions remain unaltered. Mr. Chan and the Company had previously entered into a credit agreement on March 6, 2011, which was subsequently amended by amending agreements dated October 24, 2011, June 15, 2012, December 28, 2012, April 1, 2014 and May 29, 2015 whereby Mr. Chan agreed to make available to the Company a credit line equal to an aggregate of $7,000,000 for the Company’s corporate purposes. Under the terms of the arrangement, the amount borrowed by the Company bears simple interest at a rate of 1% per month. The amount borrowed is secured by a general security agreement over the assets of the Company and is due on demand.
 
Under the terms of the proposal, in exchange for Mr. Chan making available the additional loan of $1,500,000 to the Company, the Company would be required to:

Additional Financing
 
On September 25, 2017 the Company announced that it had authorized a private placement up to $5 million for the issuance of convertible debentures that are convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at a price of $0.05 per share (the “Note”).
 
On June 13, 2018 the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the “Chairman”) of the Company accepted a proposal from the board of directors of the Company to purchase the $5,000,000 convertible debenture financing (the “Financing”). The Note will be convertible for a period of 5 years, will bear interest at a rate of 8 percent per annum and will be repayable in 4 equal semi-annual instalments starting 42 months after its issuance until maturity. The Note will be transferable or saleable by the Chairman or other holder thereof, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to the Company.
 
On September 20, 2018, the parties agreed to increase the proposed Financing from $5,000,000 to $7,000,000. On October 25, 2018, the parties have to increase the proposed Financing from $7,000,000 to $8,500,000 (the “Amended Financing”). The Amended Financing will continue to be convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at $0.05 per share.
 
The Company and the Chairman are continuing discussions on a definitive agreement to implement the Note with the customary terms, conditions and representations of a commercial lending agreement. The closing of the Amended Financing and sale of the Note will not occur until such time that is 30 days subsequent to the confirmation of the Company’s first commercial sale of its diabetes management software program which has not yet occurred.
