Our brands
 
We market the premium and super premium brands listed below.
 
Jefferson’s bourbons and rye whiskey. We develop and market four premium, very small batch bourbons: Jefferson’s, Jefferson’s Reserve, Jefferson’s Ocean Aged at Sea and Jefferson’s Presidential Select. Each of these four distinct premium Kentucky bourbons is blended in batches using select barrels of certain mash bills and ages to produce specific flavor profiles. We also market Jefferson’s Straight Rye Whiskey, a premium whiskey distilled from 100% North American rye, Jefferson’s Chef’s Collaboration, a blend of bourbon and rye, Jefferson’s The Manhattan: Barrel Finished Cocktail, a ready-to-drink cocktail, Jefferson’s Wine Finish Collection, bourbons aged in wine barrels, and Jefferson’s Wood Experiment, innovative wood-finished bourbons.
 
Goslings rums and ginger beer. We are the exclusive global distributor (other than in Bermuda) for Goslings rums, including Goslings Black Seal Dark Rum, Goslings Gold Seal Rum and Goslings Old Rum. The Gosling family produces these rums in Bermuda, where Goslings rums have been under continuous production and ownership by the Gosling family for over 200 years. We hold an 80.1% controlling interest in Gosling-Castle Partners Inc., or GCP, a global export venture between us and the Gosling family. GCP has the exclusive long-term export and distribution rights for the Goslings rum products for all countries other than Bermuda. The Goslings rum brands accounted for approximately 20% and 21% of our revenues for our 2019 and 2018 fiscal years, respectively. We also are the exclusive global distributor (other than in Bermuda and various regional markets) of Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer, an essential non-alcoholic ingredient in Goslings trademarked Dark ‘n Stormy ® rum cocktail and the Goslings Dark ‘n Stormy ® cocktail in a ready-to-drink can.
 
Knappogue Castle whiskeys. We developed our Knappogue Castle Whiskey, a single malt Irish whiskey, to build on both the popularity of single malt Scotch whisky and the growth in the Irish whiskey category. Knappogue Castle Whiskey is distilled in pot stills using malted barley and is aged twelve years. We have introduced Knappogue Twin Wood, the first Sherry Finished Knappogue Castle Whiskey. The whiskey is matured for sixteen years in two types of wood resulting in a perfectly balanced single malt Irish whiskey with a complex, rich taste and a slightly sweet sherry finish. Knappogue Castle 1951 is a pure pot-still whiskey that was distilled in 1951 and then aged for 36 years in sherry casks. The name comes from an Irish castle, formerly owned by Mark Edwin Andrews, the originator of the brand and the father of Mark Andrews, our chairman.
 
Clontarf Irish whiskeys. Our family of Clontarf Irish whiskeys currently represents a majority of our case sales of Irish whiskey. Clontarf, an accessible and smooth premium Irish whiskey, is distilled using quality grains and pure Irish spring water. Clontarf is then aged in bourbon barrels and mellowed through Irish oak charcoal. Clontarf is available in single malt and classic versions.

Brady’s Irish Cream liqueurs. Brady’s Irish Cream, a high-quality Irish cream, is made in small batches using Irish whiskey, dairy fresh cream and natural flavors.
 
Boru vodka. Boru vodka, a premium vodka produced in Ireland, was developed in 1998 and is named after the legendary High King of Ireland, Brian Boru, who united the Irish clans and drove foreign invaders out of Ireland. It is five-times distilled using pure spring water for smoothness and filtered through ten feet of charcoal made from Irish oak for increased purity.
 
Celtic Honey liqueur. Celtic Honey is a premium brand of Irish liqueur that is a unique combination of Irish spirits, cognac and a taste of honey. Gaelic Heritage Corporation Limited, an affiliate of one of our bottlers, has the exclusive rights to produce and supply us with Celtic Honey.
 
Pallini liqueurs. We have the exclusive U.S. distribution rights (excluding duty free sales) for Pallini Limoncello and its related brand extensions. Pallini Limoncello is a premium lemon liqueur, which is served ice cold, on the rocks or as an ingredient in a wide variety of drinks, ranging from martinis to iced tea. It is also used in cooking, particularly for pastries and cakes. Pallini Limoncello is crafted from an authentic family recipe. It is made with Italy’s finest Sfusato Amalfitano lemons that are hand-selected for optimal freshness and flavor. There are two other flavor extensions of this Italian liqueur: Pallini Peachcello, made with white peaches, and Pallini Raspicello, made from a combination of raspberries and other berries.
 
Gozio amaretto. We are the exclusive U.S. distributor for Gozio amaretto, which is made from a secret recipe that combines selected fruits from four continents.
 
Arran Scotch whiskeys. In 2017, we became the exclusive U.S. distributor for the Arran Scotch whiskeys. Arran Scotch whiskeys are produced by Isle of Arran Distillers, an independent distiller of premium quality Single Malt Scotch whiskeys. Located in the village of Lochranza on the Isle of Arran, the distillery opened in 1995 and is the only whisky producer on the island. The Arran portfolio includes the classic 10 Years Old, the new 18 Years Old, as well as the official Robert Burns whiskeys, endorsed by the World Burns Federation, and the limited edition Machrie Moor Scotch Whiskeys.
 
Our strategy
 
Our objective is to continue building Castle Brands into a profitable international spirits company, with a distinctive portfolio of premium and super premium spirits brands. To achieve this, we continue to seek to:
 

● | focus on our more profitable brands and markets. We continue to focus our distribution efforts, sales expertise and targeted marketing activities on our more profitable brands and markets; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | grow organically. We believe that continued organic growth will enable us to achieve long-term profitability. We focus on brands that have profitable growth potential and staying power, such as our rums, whiskeys and ginger beer, sales of which have grown substantially in recent years; 
● | focus on innovation. We continue to innovate in our portfolio by developing new brand extensions, expressions, blends and processes, such as our Ocean Aged at Sea bourbons and our wine-finishes for our bourbons and Irish whiskeys. We believe that continued focus on innovation will drive sales growth, build brand loyalty, and open new markets; 
● | leverage our distribution network. Our established distribution network in all 50 U.S. states enables us to promote our brands nationally and makes us an attractive strategic partner for smaller companies seeking U.S. distribution; 
● | selectively add new brands to our portfolio. We continue to explore strategic relationships, joint ventures and acquisitions to selectively expand our premium spirits portfolio. For example, we added the Arran Scotch whiskeys to our portfolio as agency brands. We expect that future acquisitions or agency relations, if any, would involve some combination of cash, debt and the issuance of our stock; and 
● | build consumer awareness. We use our existing assets, expertise and resources to build consumer awareness and market penetration for our brands. 

 
Production and supply
 
There are several steps in the production and supply process for beverage alcohol products, whether we produce certain products through third-party suppliers or purchase certain products directly from brand owners. First, all of our spirits products are distilled. This is a multi-stage process that converts basic ingredients, such as grain or sugar cane, into alcohol. Next, the alcohol is processed and/or aged in various ways depending on the requirements of the specific brand. For our vodka, this processing is designed to remove all other chemicals, so that the resulting liquid will be odorless and colorless and have a smooth quality with minimal harshness. Achieving a high level of purity involves a series of distillations and filtration processes.

For our spirits brands, rather than removing flavor, various complex flavor profiles are achieved through one or more of the following techniques: infusion of fruit, addition of various flavoring substances, and, in the case of rums and whiskeys, aging of the brands in various types of casks for extended periods of time and the blending of several rums or whiskeys to achieve a unique flavor profile for each brand. After the distillation, purification and flavoring processes are completed, the various liquids are bottled. This involves several important stages, including bottle and label design and procurement, filling of the bottles and packaging of the bottles in various configurations for shipment.
 
We do not have significant investments in distillation, bottling or other production facilities or equipment. Instead, we have entered into relationships with several companies to provide those services to us. We believe that these types of arrangements allow us to avoid committing significant amounts of capital to fixed assets and permit us to have the flexibility to meet growing sales levels by dealing with companies whose capacity significantly exceeds our current needs. These relationships vary on a brand-by-brand basis as discussed below. As part of our ongoing cost-containment efforts, we intend to continue to review each of our business relationships to determine if we can increase the efficiency of our operations.
 
Jefferson’s whiskeys
 
Our Jefferson’s whiskey portfolio is bottled for us by Luxco, Inc. (“Luxco”), in Cleveland, OH, from our stocks of aged bourbon and rye. Bourbon has been in short supply in the U.S. in recent years, and we continue to actively seek alternate sourcing for future supply. We have acquired stocks of aged bourbon, which we anticipate will supply our currently forecasted needs for the Jefferson’s brand, although there is no assurance we can source adequate amounts of bourbon or rye, if demand is greater than expected, at satisfactory prices.

We are parties to a supply agreement with a bourbon distiller, which provides for the production of newly distilled bourbon whiskey through June 30, 2026. Under this agreement, the distiller provides us with an agreed upon amount of original proof gallons of newly distilled bourbon whiskey, subject to certain annual adjustments. We are not obligated to pay the distiller for any product not yet received. Also, if the distiller has excess inventory in any year, we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase such excess.
 
We have entered into another supply agreement with a bourbon distiller, which provides for the production of newly distilled bourbon whiskey through December 31, 2019, subject to automatic annual renewals. Under this agreement, the distiller provides us with an agreed upon amount of original proof gallons of newly distilled bourbon whiskey, subject to certain annual adjustments. We are not obligated to pay the distiller for any product not yet received.
 
Goslings rum and ginger beer
 
Goslings rums have been produced by the Gosling family in Hamilton, Bermuda for over 200 years and, under our distribution arrangements with Gosling’s Export (Bermuda) Limited (“Gosling’s Export”), they have retained the right to act as the sole supplier to GCP with respect to our Goslings rum requirements. Goslings sources its rums in the Caribbean and transports them to Bermuda where they are blended according to proprietary recipes. The rums are then sent to a plant, owned and operated by a third party, in the United States, where they are bottled, packaged, stored and shipped to our third-party warehouse. We believe that Gosling’s Export’s blending and storage facilities in Bermuda will accommodate our projected supply needs for the foreseeable future. We believe our third-party U.S. bottler has ample capacity to meet our projected bottling needs for the foreseeable future. See “Strategic brand-partner relationships.”
 
Our Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer is produced, canned and/or bottled by third-party soft-drink bottlers and canners to Goslings’ formula and requirements. We believe these bottlers and canners have ample capacity to meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable future.
 
Knappogue Castle and Clontarf Irish whiskeys
 
In 2012, we entered into two long-term supply agreements with Irish Distillers Limited (“IDL”), a subsidiary of Pernod Ricard, under which it has agreed to supply us with the aged single malt and grain whiskeys used in our Knappogue Castle whiskey products and all of our Clontarf Irish whiskey products. The first supply agreement provides for the production of blended Irish whiskeys for us until the contract is terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the agreement. IDL may terminate the contract if it provides at least six years prior notice, except for breach. Under this agreement, we provide IDL with a forecast of the estimated amount of liters of pure alcohol we require for the next four fiscal contract years and agree to purchase that amount, subject to certain annual adjustments. The second supply agreement provides for the production of single malt Irish whiskeys for us until the contract is terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the agreement. IDL may terminate the contract if it provides at least thirteen years prior notice, except for breach. Under this agreement, we provide IDL with a forecast of the estimated amount of liters of pure alcohol we require for the next twelve fiscal contract years and agree to purchase that amount, subject to certain annual adjustments. We are not obligated to pay for any product not yet received. The whiskeys are then sent to Terra Limited (“Terra”) in Baileyboro, Ireland, where they are bottled in bottles we designed and packaged for shipment. We believe that Terra, which also acts as bottler for certain of our Boru vodka and as producer and bottler of our Brady’s Irish Cream (and as bottler for Celtic Honey, which is supplied to us by one of Terra’s affiliates), has sufficient bottling capacity to meet our current needs, and both Terra and IDL have the capacity to meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable future.
 
Terra provides intake, storage, sampling, testing, filtering, filling, capping and labeling of bottles, case packing, warehousing and loading and inventory control for our Knappogue Castle and Clontarf Irish whiskeys at prices that are adjusted annually by mutual agreement based on changes in raw materials and consumer price indexes increases up to 3.5% per annum. This agreement also provides for maintenance of product specifications and minimum processing procedures, including compliance with applicable food and alcohol regulations and maintenance, storage and stock control of all raw products and finished products delivered to Terra. Terra holds all alcohol on its premises under its customs and excise bond. Our bottling and services agreement with Terra will expire on June 30, 2019. We expect to continue to operate under the terms of the expiring contract as we negotiate a new agreement with Terra. We believe we could obtain alternative sources of bottling and services if we are unable to renew the existing Terra contract.
 
Boru vodka
 
We have a supply agreement with a leading European producer of grain neutral spirits to provide us with the distilled alcohol used in our Boru vodka. The supply agreement provides for the producer to produce natural spirit for us with specified levels of alcohol content pursuant to specifications set forth in the agreement and at specified prices through its expiration in December 2019, in quantities designated by us. We believe that the producer has sufficient distilling capacity to meet our needs for Boru vodka for the foreseeable future. If we do not renew the production agreement, we believe that we will be able to obtain grain neutral spirits from another supplier.
 
The five-times distilled alcohol is delivered from the producer to the bottling premises at Terra, where it is filtered in several proprietary ways, and pure water is added to achieve the desired proof. Depending on the size of the bottle, Boru vodka is then either bottled at Terra or shipped in bulk to the U.S. and bottled at Luxco, where we bottle certain sizes for the U.S. market. We believe that both Terra and Luxco have sufficient bottling capacity to meet our current needs, and both have the capacity to meet our anticipated future supply needs. As described above, our bottling and services agreement with Terra will expire on June 30, 2019. We expect to continue to operate under the terms of the expiring contract as we negotiate a new agreement with Terra. We believe we could obtain alternative sources of bottling and services if we are unable to renew the existing Terra contract.
 
Brady’s Irish Cream
 
Brady’s Irish Cream is produced for us by Terra. Fresh cream is combined with Irish whiskey, grain neutral spirits and various flavorings to our specifications, and then bottled by Terra in bottles designed for us. We believe that Terra has the capacity to meet our foreseeable supply needs for this brand. As described above, our bottling and services agreement with Terra will expire on June 30, 2019. We expect to continue to operate under the terms of the expiring contract as we negotiate a new agreement with Terra. We believe we could obtain alternative sources of bottling and services if we are unable to renew the existing Terra contract.
Celtic Honey liqueur
 
Gaelic Heritage Corporation Limited, an affiliate of Terra, has a contractual right to act as the sole supplier to us of Celtic Honey. Gaelic Heritage mixes the ingredients comprising Celtic Honey using a proprietary formula and then Terra bottles it for them in bottles designed for us. We believe that the necessary ingredients are available to Gaelic Heritage in sufficient supply and that Terra’s bottling capacity is currently adequate to meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable future. See “Strategic brand-partner relationships.”
 
Pallini liqueurs
 
Pallini SpA (“Pallini”), as successor in interest to I.L.A.R. S.p.A., an Italian company based in Rome and owned since 1875 by the Pallini family, produces Pallini Limoncello, Raspicello and Peachcello. Pallini bottles the liqueurs at its plant in Rome and ships them to us under our long-term exclusive U.S. marketing and distribution agreement. We believe that Pallini has adequate facilities to produce and bottle sufficient Limoncello, Peachcello and Raspicello to meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable future. See “Strategic brand-partner relationships.”
 
Gozio amaretto
 
We are the exclusive U.S. distributor for Gozio amaretto. Gozio amaretto is produced by Distillerie Franciacorta, a spirits company founded in 1901 and owned by the Gozio family. The company is located in Franciacorta, in the Italian Region of Lombardy. We believe that Distillerie Franciacorta has sufficient capacity to meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable future for this brand.

Arran Scotch Whiskeys
 
We are the exclusive U.S. distributor for the Isle of Arran premium whisky portfolio, produced by the Isle of Arran Distillers. The Isle of Arran Distillers is an independent distiller of premium quality Single Malt Scotch whiskeys. Located in the village of Lochranza on the Isle of Arran, the distillery opened in 1995 and is the only whisky producer on the island. The Arran’s portfolio includes the classic 10 Years Old, the new 18 Years Old as well as the official Robert Burns whiskeys, endorsed by the World Burns Federation, and the Machrie Moor whiskeys. We believe that the Isle of Arran Distillers has sufficient capacity to meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable future for these brands.
 
Distribution network
 
We believe that the distribution network that we have developed with our sales team and our independent distributors and brokers is one of our strengths. We currently have distribution and brokerage relationships with third-party distributors in all 50 U.S. states, as well as distribution arrangements in approximately 20 other countries.
 
U.S. distribution
 
Background. Importers of beverage alcohol in the U.S. must sell their products through a three-tier distribution system. Typically, an imported brand is first sold to a U.S. importer, who then sells it to a network of distributors, or wholesalers, covering the U.S., in either “open” states or “control” states. In the 33 open states, the distributors are generally large, privately-held companies. In the 17 control states, the states themselves function as the distributor, and regulate suppliers such as us. The distributors and wholesalers in turn sell to individual retailers, such as liquor stores, restaurants, bars, supermarkets and other outlets licensed to sell beverage alcohol. In larger states such as New York, more than one distributor may handle a brand in separate geographical areas. In control states, importers sell their products directly to state liquor authorities, which distribute the products and either operate retail outlets or license the retail sales function to private companies, while maintaining strict control over pricing and profit.
 
The U.S. spirits industry has consolidated dramatically over the last ten years due to merger and acquisition activity. There are currently at least twelve major spirits companies, each of which own and operate their own importing businesses. All companies, including these large companies, are required by law to sell their products through wholesale distributors in the U.S. The major companies are exerting increasing influence over the regional distributors and as a result, it has become more difficult for smaller companies to get their products recognized by the distributors. We believe our established distribution network in all 50 states allows us to overcome a significant barrier to entry in the U.S. beverage alcohol market and enhances our attractiveness as a strategic partner for smaller companies lacking comparable distribution.
 
For fiscal 2019, our U.S. sales represented approximately 91% of our revenues, and we expect them to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of our total sales in the near future. See note 16 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
Importation. We currently hold the federal importer and wholesaler license required by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department, and the requisite state license in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
 
Our inventory is strategically maintained in large bonded warehouses and shipped nationally by an extensive network of licensed and bonded carriers.
 
Wholesalers and distributors. In the U.S., we are required by law to use state-licensed distributors or, in the control states, state-owned agencies performing this function, to sell our brands to retail outlets. As a result, we depend on distributors for sales, for product placement and for retail store penetration. We currently have no distribution agreements or minimum sales requirements with any of our U.S. alcohol distributors, and they are under no obligation to place our products or market our brands. All of the distributors also distribute our competitors’ products and brands. As a result, we must foster and maintain our relationships with our distributors. Through our internal sales team, we have established relationships for our brands with wholesale distributors in each state, and our products are currently sold in the U.S. by approximately 80 wholesale distributors, as well as by various state beverage alcohol control agencies.
 
International distribution
 
In our foreign markets, most countries permit sales directly from the brand owner to retail establishments, including liquor stores, chain stores, restaurants and pubs, without requiring that sales go through a wholesaler tier. In our international markets, we rely primarily on established spirits distributors in much the same way as we do in the U.S. We have engaged an international beverage alcohol broker to represent our brands in approximately twenty international markets. We use Terra and other bonded warehouses and logistic providers to handle the billing, inventory and shipping for us for some products in certain of our non-U.S. markets.
 
As in the U.S., the beverage alcohol industry has undergone consolidation internationally, with considerable realignment of brands and brand ownership. The number of major spirits companies internationally has been reduced significantly due to mergers and brand ownership consolidation. While there are still a substantial number of companies owning one or more brands, most business is now done by the thirteen major companies, each of which owns and operates its own distribution company that distributes in the major international markets. These captive distribution companies focus primarily on the brands of the companies that own them.

Even though we do not utilize the direct route to market in our international operations, we do not believe that we are at a significant disadvantage, because the local importers/distributors typically have established relationships with the retail accounts and are able to provide extensive customer service, in store merchandising and on-premise promotions. Also, even though we must compensate our wholesalers and distributors in each market in which we sell our brands, we are, as a result of using these distributors, still able to benefit from substantially lower infrastructure costs and centralized billing and collection.
 
Our primary international markets are Ireland, Great Britain, Northern Ireland, Germany, Canada, France, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Holland and the Duty-Free markets. We also have sales in other countries in continental Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia. For fiscal 2019, non-U.S. sales represented approximately 9% of our revenues. See note 16 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
Significant customers
 
Sales to one distributor, Southern Glazer’s Wine and Spirits and related entities, accounted for approximately 36% and 37% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
Our sales team
 
While we currently expect more rapid growth in the U.S., our primary market, international markets hold potential for future growth and are part of our global strategy.
 
We currently have a total sales force of 24 people, including five regional U.S. vice presidents who have significant industry experience with premium beverage alcohol brands.
 
Our sales personnel are engaged in the day-to-day management of our distributors, which includes setting quotas, coordinating promotional plans for our brands, maintaining adequate levels of stock, brand education and training and sales calls with distributor personnel. Our sales team also maintains relationships with key retail customers through independent sales calls. They also schedule promotional events, create local brand promotion plans, host in-store tastings where permitted and provide wait staff and bartender training and education for our brands.
 
Advertising, marketing and promotion
 
To build our brands, we must effectively communicate with three distinct audiences: our distributors, the retail trade and the end consumer. Advertising, marketing and promotional activities help to establish and reinforce the image of our brands in our efforts to build substantial brand value. We believe our execution of disciplined and strategic branding and marketing campaigns will continue to drive our future sales.
 
We employ full-time, in-house marketing, sales and customer service personnel who work together with third party design and advertising firms to maintain a high degree of focus on each of our product categories and build brand awareness through innovative marketing activities. We use a range of marketing strategies and tactics to build brand equity and increase sales, including consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, in-store and on-premise promotions and public relations, as well as a variety of other traditional and non-traditional marketing techniques, including social media marketing, to support our brands.
 
Besides traditional advertising, we also employ three other marketing methods to support our brands: public relations, event sponsorships and tastings. Our significant U.S. public relations efforts have helped gain editorial coverage for our brands, which increases brand awareness. Event sponsorship is an economical way for us to have influential consumers taste our brands. We actively contribute product to trend-setting events where our brand has exclusivity in the brand category. We also conduct hundreds of in-store and on-premise promotions each year.
 
We support our brand marketing efforts with an assortment of point-of-sale materials. The combination of trade and consumer programs, supported by attractive point-of-sale materials, also establishes greater credibility for us with our distributors and retailers.
 
Strategic brand-partner relationships
 
We forge strategic relationships with emerging and established spirits brand owners seeking opportunities to increase their sales beyond their home markets and achieve global growth. This ability is a key component of our growth strategy and one of our competitive strengths. Our original relationship with the Boru vodka brand was as its exclusive U.S. distributor. To date, we have also established strategic relationships for Goslings rums, Pallini liqueurs, Celtic Honey liqueur, the Arran Scotch Whiskeys, and Gozio amaretto, as described below, and we intend to seek to expand our brand portfolio through similar future arrangements.

Gosling-Castle Partners Inc./Goslings rums and ginger beer
 
In 2005, we entered into an exclusive national distribution agreement with Gosling’s Export for the Goslings rum products. We subsequently purchased a 60% controlling interest in GCP, a strategic export venture with the Gosling family. In March 2017, we purchased an additional 20.1% interest in GCP, which we refer to as the GCP Share Acquisition, and, accordingly, we now own 80.1% of GCP. Pursuant to an export agreement entered into between Gosling’s Export and GCP, Gosling’s Export assigned to GCP all of Gosling’s Export’s interest in our distribution agreement with them. GCP holds the exclusive distribution rights for Goslings rum products and Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer on a worldwide basis (other than in Bermuda). The export agreement expires in April 2030, with ten-year renewal terms thereafter, subject to specific termination rights held by each party. Under the export agreement, in the event Gosling’s Export decides to sell any or all of its trademarks (or other intellectual property rights) relating to the Goslings’ products (other than Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer) during the term of the export agreement, GCP has a right of first refusal to purchase said trademark(s) (and intellectual property rights, if applicable) at the same price being offered by a bona fide third-party offerer. If GCP does not exercise its right of first refusal, then we have an identical right of first refusal. In the event Gosling’s Export decides to sell any or all of its products (other than Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer) and/or trademark(s) (other than Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer), whether sold to an affiliate, a third party, GCP or us, GCP is entitled to share in the proceeds of such sale, according to a schedule specified in the export agreement. Also, in the event Gosling’s Export should decide to sell Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer or trademarks relating to Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer, whether sold to an affiliate, a third party, GCP or us, then, Gosling’s Export agrees to share with GCP an amount equal to a certain percentage of the proceeds of any such sale as specified in the export agreement. The Goslings, through Gosling Brothers Limited, have the right to act as the sole supplier to GCP for our Goslings rum requirements. Polar Corp., the exclusive U.S. manufacturer of the ginger beer, is authorized to purchase product from GCP to sell directly on a non-exclusive basis to its existing customers that are grocery supermarket chains, drug store chains or convenience store chains located in New England and New York through direct store delivery or approved wholesalers, and on a limited basis to sell to liquor stores in New England that are its existing clients.
 
Pallini SpA/Pallini liqueurs
 
We have an exclusive marketing and distribution agreement with Pallini under which we distribute Pallini Limoncello, Peachcello and Raspicello liqueurs in the U.S. We began shipping these products in September 2005.
 
Our agreement with Pallini expires on March 31, 2021, subject to successive five-year renewals unless either party delivers a notice of non-renewal six months prior to the end of the term. Under the agreement, if minimum shipment targets are not achieved and not cured, Pallini has the right to terminate the agreement without payment of termination fees to us. However, if such targets are met, we have the right under the agreement to receive certain termination payments and other payments upon the non-renewal of the agreement, certain terminations of the agreement or the sale of the brand. The exclusive territory under the agreement is the 50 states of the U.S. and the District of Columbia.
 
Gozio amaretto
 
In November 2011, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Distillerie Franciacorta S.p.A. under which we are the exclusive distributor of Gozio amaretto in the U.S. The agreement had an initial five-year term, and has automatic five-year renewals unless either party delivers a notice of non-renewal six months prior to the end of the term. During the term, we have the right to purchase Gozio amaretto at stipulated prices and Distillerie Franciacorta Spa must maintain certain standards for its products. We are required to prepare periodic reports detailing the development of the brand’s sales and prepare annual strategic marketing and growth plans.
 
Arran Scotch Whiskeys
 
In February 2017, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with the Isle of Arran Distillers under which we are the exclusive distributors for The Arran Malt Single Malt Scotch Whiskeys, the Robert Burns Single Malt Scotch Whisky and Blended Scotch Whisky and the Machrie Moor whiskeys in the U.S. market. The agreement has an initial term expiring on March 31, 2022, and has automatic five-year renewals upon our achieving certain minimum purchase requirements. During the term, we have the right to purchase Isle of Arran, Robert Burns and Machrie Moor products at stipulated prices and Isle of Arran must maintain certain standards for its products. We are required to prepare periodic reports detailing the development of the brand’s sales and prepare annual strategic marketing and growth plans.
 
Intellectual property
 
Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell our products under a number of trademarks, which we own or use under license. Our brands are protected by trademark registrations or are the subject of pending applications for trademark registration in the U.S., the European Union and most other countries where we distribute, or plan to distribute, our brands. The trademarks may be registered in the names of our subsidiaries and related companies. Generally, the term of a trademark registration varies from country to country, and, in the U.S., trademark registrations need to be renewed every ten years. We expect to register our trademarks in additional markets as we expand our distribution territories.
 
We have entered into distribution agreements for brands owned by third parties, such as the Goslings rums, the Pallini liqueurs, Isle of Arran whiskeys and Gozio amaretto. The Goslings brands, Pallini liqueurs, Isle of Arran and Robert Burns Scotch whiskeys and Gozio amaretto are registered by their respective owners. Goslings also has a trademark for their signature rum cocktail, Dark ‘n Stormy. See “Strategic brand-partner relationships.”

Competition
 
The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We believe that we compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength. Our premium brands compete with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, retail shelf space, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, many of which have greater resources than us.
 
Over the past ten years, the U.S. spirits industry has undergone dramatic consolidation and realignment of brands and brand ownership. The number of major importers in the U.S. has declined significantly. Today there are at least thirteen major companies: Diageo PLC, Pernod Ricard S.A., Bacardi Limited, Brown-Forman Corporation, Beam Suntory Inc., Davide Campari Milano-S.p.A., Remy Cointreau S.A., LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A, Constellation Brands, Inc., Proximo Spirits, Sazerac Company, Inc., Heaven Hill Brands and William Grant & Sons Distillers, Ltd.
 
We believe that we are sometimes in a better position to partner with small to mid-size brands than the major importers. Despite our relative capital position and resources, we have been able to compete with these larger companies in pursuing agency distribution agreements and acquiring brands by being more responsive to private and family-owned brands, offering flexible transaction structures and providing brand owners the option to retain local production and “home” market sales. Given our size relative to our major competitors, most of which have multi-billion dollar operations, we believe that we can provide greater focus on smaller brands and tailor transaction structures based on individual brand owner preferences. However, our relative capital position and resources may limit our marketing capabilities, limit our ability to expand into new markets and limit our negotiating ability with our distributors.
 
By focusing on the premium and super-premium segments of the market, which typically have higher margins, and having an established, experienced sales force, we believe we are able to gain relatively significant attention from our distributors for a company of our size. Our U.S. regional vice presidents provide long-standing relationships with distributor personnel and with their major customers. Finally, the continued consolidation among the major companies is expected to create an opportunity for small to mid-size wine and spirits companies, such as ourselves, as the major companies contract their portfolios to focus on fewer brands.
 
Government regulation
 
We are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, U.S. Customs Laws, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Laws of all fifty states.
 
The U.S. Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulates the production, blending, bottling, sales and advertising and transportation of alcohol products. Also, each state regulates the advertising, promotion, transportation, sale and distribution of alcohol products within its jurisdiction. We are also required to conduct business in the U.S. only with holders of licenses to import, warehouse, transport, distribute and sell spirits.
 
In Europe, we are subject to similar regulations related to the production of spirits.
 
We are subject to U.S. and European regulations on the advertising, marketing and sale of beverage alcohol. These regulations range from a complete prohibition of the marketing of alcohol in some countries to restrictions on the advertising style, media and messages used.
 
Labeling of spirits is also regulated in many markets, varying from health warning labels to importer identification, alcohol strength and other consumer information. All beverage alcohol products sold in the U.S. must include warning statements related to risks of drinking beverage alcohol products.
 
We are also subject to certain regulatory requirements regarding minimum aging of spirits.
 
In the U.S. control states, the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and offered for sale in their respective states. Products are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures which are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Consumers may purchase products not selected for listings only through special orders, if at all.
 
The distribution of alcohol-based beverages is also subject to extensive federal and state taxation in the U.S. and internationally. Most foreign countries in which we do business impose excise duties on distilled spirits, although the form of such taxation varies from a simple application on units of alcohol by volume to intricate systems based on the imported or wholesale value of the product. Several countries impose additional import duty on distilled spirits, often discriminating between categories in the rate of such tariffs. Import and excise duties may have a significant effect on our sales, both through reducing the consumption of alcohol and through encouraging consumer switching into lower-taxed categories of alcohol.

We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable federal, state and other regulations. However, we operate in a highly regulated industry which may be subject to more stringent interpretations of existing regulations. Future compliance costs due to regulatory changes could be significant.
 
Since we import distilled spirits products produced primarily outside the U.S., adverse effects of regulatory changes are more likely to materially affect earnings and our competitive market position rather than capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in our industry are normally associated with either production facilities or brand acquisition costs. Because we are not a U.S. producer, changes in regulations affecting production facility operations may indirectly affect the costs of the brands we purchase for resale, but we would not anticipate any resulting material adverse impact upon our capital expenditures.
 
Global conglomerates with international brands dominate our industry. The adoption of more restrictive marketing and sales regulations or increased excise taxes and customs duties could materially adversely affect our earnings and competitive industry position. Large international conglomerates have greater financial resources than we do and would be better able to absorb increased compliance costs.
