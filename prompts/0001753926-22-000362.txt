ITEM 1    BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
Western Capital Resources, Inc. (“WCR” or “Western Capital”), a Delaware corporation originally incorporated in Minnesota in 2001 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2016, is a holding company having a controlling interest in subsidiaries operating in the following industries and operating segments:
 


Our Cellular Retail segment is comprised of an authorized Cricket Wireless dealer and involves the retail sale of cellular phones and accessories to consumers through our wholly-owned subsidiary PQH Wireless, Inc. and its controlled but less than 100% owned subsidiaries. Our Direct to Consumer segment consists of a wholly-owned branded online and direct marketing distribution retailer of live plants, seeds, holiday gifts and garden accessories selling its products under Park Seed, Jackson & Perkins and Wayside Gardens brand names and home improvement and restoration products operating as Van Dyke’s Restorers as well as a wholesaler under the Park Wholesale brand. Our manufacturing segment consists of a wholly-owned manufacturer of lawn and garden power equipment and emergency safety shelters selling products primarily under the Swisher brand name and also providing turn-key manufacturing services to third parties. Our Consumer Finance segment consists of retail financial services conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Wyoming Financial Lenders, Inc. and Express Pawn, Inc. Throughout this report, we collectively refer to WCR and its consolidated subsidiaries as “we,” the “Company,” and “us.”
 
We expect segment operating results and earnings per share to change throughout 2022 and beyond due, at least in part, to the seasonality of the various segments, recently completed and potential merger and acquisition activity, the unknown impact of COVID-19, the effects of inflationary pressures, as well as supply and labor shortages
 
RECENT EVENTS
 
Acquisitions 
 
On March 11, 2022, our Cellular Retail segment entered into a series of definitive agreements to purchase 80% of Gateway Wireless, LLC – an operator of 56 Cricket Wireless locations in Missouri and several other states.
 
On January 14, 2022, the Company’s Direct to Consumer segment acquired From Seed to Spoon, a garden planning App that makes growing food easier. From Seed to Spoon is yet another tool in Park Seed’s tool shed designed to inspire, teach, and reach customers where they get information today – on their phones. From Seed to Spoon calculates planting dates based on GPS location taking the guesswork out of when to plant seeds. In addition to providing personalized planting dates, the App also includes companion planting guides, recipes, organic pest treatments, and beneficial insect guides. It even enables users to filter plants by health benefit. The App also provides an easy and direct path to purchasing seeds from our Park Seed business.
 
Our Cellular Retail segment completed a $4.7 million acquisition of 25 Cricket Wireless retail stores on September 9, 2021, which are wholly owned. All but four of these stores are located in markets that we currently operate in, allowing existing management to efficiently integrate the acquired locations into their portfolios. Three of the outlier stores will be added to an expanded existing market, while one will be our first presence in Alaska.
 
On January 8, 2021, our newly-formed Manufacturing segment completed a merger with Swisher Acquisition, Inc. (“Swisher”), which was an entity under common control of a related party. Pursuant to the merger, the Company issued 408,000 shares of our common stock as consideration for the merger and Swisher became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company as the survivor of the merger.
 
We are actively searching for additional acquisition opportunities. We are industry agnostic and target leaders in niche industries or geographies as well as opportunistic purchases of businesses that we believe we can improve operationally. We have a particular interest in companies facing succession dilemmas, corporate divestitures, and businesses in out-of-favor industries. In addition, we seek to grow our subsidiaries through add-on acquisitions in the e-commerce, cellular retail and manufacturing segments. Our overall strategy continues to focus on building a diversified portfolio of strong cash flow generating businesses. Our financial strength, long-term view and operating expertise allow subsidiary companies to focus on growing and maximizing return on investment. We expect to be patient and move upon what we believe to be the right investment opportunities.

CELLULAR RETAIL SEGMENT
 
General Description
 
We operate cellular retail stores as an authorized Cricket Wireless retailer, selling cellular phones and accessories, activating Cricket Wireless customers on the Cricket network, providing ancillary services and accepting service payments from Cricket customers. As an authorized Cricket Wireless dealer, we are only permitted to sell the Cricket line of no-contract cellular phones and service at our Cricket retail stores.
 
We generate revenue in this business through retail sales of cellular phones, receipt of back-end compensation from Cricket, sales of phone accessories (e.g., cases, chargers and bluetooth devices), fees charged when a customer changes services (service activations and reactivations, adding lines, phone number changes, etc.), or whenever a customer whom we activated on the Cricket network pays his or her no-contract cellular bill.
 
A summary table of the number of cellular retail stores we operated during the periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 follows:
 

 | 2021 | | | 2020
--------------------+------+-----+---+-----
Beginning | | 205 | | | 222 | 
Acquired / Launched | | 34 | | | 20 | 
Closed / Divested | | (10 | ) | | (37 | )
Ending | | 229 | | | 205 | 

Market Information and Marketing
 
Cricket Wireless provides nationwide 5G coverage and offers customers simple, no annual contract, no overages, predictable and affordable nationwide flat rate wireless plans. Cricket Wireless customers have the added advantage of unlimited talk, text and picture messages in the U.S. and high-speed data access which varies by plan (speeds are reduced after reaching high-speed data allowances on some plans) on the AT&T network.
 
No-contract cellular products and services were historically targeted primarily only to market segments that were underserved by traditional communications companies requiring credit approval, a contractual commitment from the subscriber for a period of at least one year, and often included overage charges for minute and data usage in excess of a specified limit. We believe that a large portion of the U.S. cellular market consists of customers who are price-sensitive and prefer not to enter into these fixed-term contracts. However, postpaid carriers are making changes to plans and contract requirements, diminishing the difference between pre- and postpaid plans. We believe that the Cricket Wireless cellular retail product and service offerings we offer appeal strongly to both the underserved markets and the greater U.S. cellular market and believe we are positioned to benefit as a Cricket Wireless dealer.
 
Market Strategy
 
We believe that our business model is scalable and we can apply our operational protocols and administrative office functions to continue expanding our cellular retail business. We will continue to evaluate strategic and opportunistic acquisitions of existing Cricket dealerships and will actively close, dispose or consolidate locations that do not meet our operating criteria in order to streamline operations.
Products and Services
 
Our authorized Cricket retail stores offer the following products and services:
 

● | Cricket Wireless service plans, each designed to attract customers by offering simple, no annual contract, no overages, predictable and affordable talk, text, picture messaging and high-speed data services that are a competitive alternative to traditional wireless and wireline services (e.g., flat-rate and unlimited talk/text/picture messages plans, without fixed-term contracts, early termination fees or credit checks); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cricket Wireless plan upgrades, such as Cricket International, individual country add-ons, Cricket Protect and mobile hotspots; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cricket handsets: and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | A wide range of cellular accessories. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
When purchasing a phone, our customers have options among the latest in Apple, Samsung and other Android-based and Windows OS-based smartphones. Because there is no contract for the monthly service, customer phone purchases are paid in full at the time of purchase.

Seasonality
 
Our Cellular Retail segment operations are influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors affecting our customer base. In particular, we generally expect sales activity to be highest in the first and fourth quarters. Nevertheless, our revenues can be strongly affected by the launch of new markets, new or improved products such as the release of the latest smartphone edition, promotional activity, the timing of federal tax-refunds and stimulus programs and the actions of our competitors, any of which have the ability to offset or exacerbate the seasonality we normally experience.
Competition
 
There is substantial and ever-increasing competition in the wireless phone industry where customers can choose between many other postpaid and no-contract resellers, including AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile/Metro, Boost Mobile and a larger number of regional providers. We compete for customers based principally on Cricket’s service/device offerings, price, call quality and coverage area.
 
Competition for the no-contract customers historically was primarily among Metro, Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile, but now also includes the traditional postpaid carriers that have introduced no-contract products. There is also competition with other no-contract phone service providers such as Straight Talk by Wal-Mart or Wal-Mart’s Family Mobile powered by T-Mobile, an increase of national retailers offering similar or identical products and services that we provide, such as Cricket phones sold at Game Stop, Best Buy, Wal-Mart and others, and an increase in mobile virtual network operator (“MVNO”) offerings.
 
Our Cricket store business also competes with other current or potential authorized Cricket Wireless dealers and direct-to-consumer sales through the Cricket Wireless website. The authorization to sell Cricket products and services is granted by Cricket Wireless, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T. Our ability to compete with other sellers of Cricket products and services will depend on the success with which we operate our stores and the attractiveness of their locations.
 
DIRECT TO CONSUMER SEGMENT
 
General Description
 
Our Direct to Consumer segment is a direct marketer of roses, plants, seeds, holiday gifts and home restoration products. The business is composed of: 1) a multi-channel retailer of seeds, garden and living gift products; 2) a wholesale seed business; and 3) a multi-channel retailer of home hardware and restoration products. Our garden products brands are highly recognizable in the rose and garden space as both the Jackson & Perkins and Park Seed brands were founded roughly 150 years ago.
 
Since fiscal 2020, our Direct to Consumer segment benefitted from the industry-wide changes in consumer purchasing methods and increase in demand for products ordered online, and from increased consumer interest in gardening and seed-related products.
 
Products and Services
 
Our Direct to Consumer segment sells product through catalogs and online under the following brands:
 
● Jackson & Perkins, founded in 1872, has approximately 150 years of history and is the most recognized brand of premium garden roses. Jackson and Perkins is one of the largest direct-to-consumer retailers of bare root roses in the United States, selling over 130 active varieties of bare root roses, of which 23 varieties are patented by Jackson and Perkins. In addition to bare root roses, we sell perennials, flower bulbs, outdoor living products as well as living holiday gifts plants. Holiday gifts include fresh evergreen wreaths, live decorative Christmas trees and holiday amaryllis. 
 ● Park Seed, founded in 1868, has over 150 years in the business and one of America’s oldest and largest direct-to-consumer seed retailers. As a leader within the Direct to Consumer seed business, Park Seed sells over 2,500 premium vegetable and flower seed options, as well as various gardening supplies. The wholesale seed business sells seeds, plants and other horticultural products in larger quantities to small-medium sized growers, nurseries and garden centers. Plants and seeds sales are concentrated during the spring months. 
 ● Wayside Gardens, founded approximately 100 years ago, sells unique, hard to find high-end flowers, plants and gardening supplies to the master gardener. The Wayside Gardens customer is extremely selective, very knowledgeable, and seeks high quality plants. Approximately 70% of sales occur in the three months from March to May, during the spring planting season. 
 ● Van Dyke’s, an online and catalog retailer with a vast assortment of vintage home restoration wood products, hardware and antique furniture, many of which are hard to find. Van Dyke’s focus is on hardware, decorative wood, home accents, knobs and pulls and kitchen, bath and other décor.
Seasonality
 
Demand for live goods and holiday products is cyclical in nature, sensitive to seasonal growing patterns, general weather conditions, holiday sales patterns and competitive influences. As such, the Direct to Consumer segment’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could fluctuate significantly from period to period. The majority of segment revenue is derived in three selling periods, spring, fall, and the December holiday season, while the summer season accounts for a small portion of sales.

Market Strategy
 
As a direct-to-consumer retailer, we focus our marketing spending on internet advertising, mail order catalogs and traditional advertising mediums (i.e., public relations, magazines, social media, etc.). We are focused on niche markets and direct our advertising to repeat and new customers through internet marketing strategies, including through our From Seed to Spoon garden planning App.
Competition
 
In the retail garden business, within the bare root rose category, we compete against brick and mortar garden centers and nurseries (approximately 10,000 across the United States), as well as other online and mail-order retailers, including David Austin Roses and Regan Nursery. Across other plant categories, we compete against brick and mortar garden centers and big-box retailers, Gardens Alive and their portfolio of brands, as well as other direct-to-consumer competitors. Competitors for our seed and growing accessory category include brick and mortar retailers and other direct-to-consumers retailers like Burpee. Within the seed business, Burpee, in addition to having an online presence, supplies lower-end seed products to mass-market retailers, including Wal-Mart. Our biggest competitive advantages are our recognizable brand names and their affiliated product lines: Jackson & Perkins brand name and unique rose varieties and our Park Seed brand name and its exclusive garden seeds and growing products. In addition, Jackson & Perkins’ successful online platform provides a competitive advantage over brick and mortar garden centers and nurseries with many consumers, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic started. The most direct competitor for Wayside Gardens is White Flower Farms, which also focuses on high-end, premium plants.
 
Within the holiday gifting portion of this segment, we compete against larger competitors including Harry and David and 1-800 Flowers, among others.
 
Our Van Dyke’s Restorers brand competes primarily with other online retailers because brick and mortar stores cannot afford to carry Van Dyke’s breadth of SKUs. Our competitors are Signature Hardware, House of Antique Hardware, and Rejuvenation Hardware (part of Williams Sonoma). These competitors compete primarily in the hardware, lighting and kitchen and bath categories. The decorative wood portion of the Van Dyke’s business is in a very fragmented industry niche and there are no big decorative wood competitors. Van Dyke’s competes primarily through the breadth of its product variety as well as through its established brand name and customer list.
 
MANUFACTURING SEGMENT
 
General Description
 
Our Manufacturing segment is a 2021 addition resulting from a merger with Swisher, a manufacturer of lawn and garden power equipment and emergency safety shelters, and provider of turn-key manufacturing services to third parties.
Products and Services
 
Swisher is a manufacturing of mowers (finish cut, rough cut, walk behind and zero turn), safety shelters, agricultural accessories, timber management equipment and string trimmers and sells product primarily under the Swisher brand name. Product is sold through e-commerce and brick & mortar retailers, factory/consumer direct and at its factory direct and at its factory outlet store in Warrensburg, Missouri.
 
In addition to manufacturing products, Swisher also provides a host of manufacturing services, including:
 

● | Powder Coating 
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | Fabrication
--+------------


● | Assembly and Distribution 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Welding
--+--------


● | Engineering and Design 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Contract Manufacturing 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Swisher was founded in 1945 by Company entrepreneur Max Swisher who pioneered the zero-turn mower concept and used this new technology to launch a new manufacturing company based in Warrensburg, MO. Swisher remains based in Warrensburg, MO continuing to manufacture top quality, Made in America, outdoor power equipment. The Company recently expanded into the above ground home security/tornado shelter market with “ESP” branded products, which feature multiple unique consumer benefits, outstanding safety and ease of installation. Swisher management has also leveraged the Company’s manufacturing competencies and facility through establishing a “Turn-Key” contract manufacturing business that has gained significant sales momentum over the last year. The new product offerings and manufacturing initiatives along with recently opening a factory retail outlet and service center have reduced the Company’s historical reliance on outdoor power equipment sales.
 
Seasonality
 
Outdoor power equipment sales are concentrated in the months from March through late September early October. Weather can be a significant factor impacting the selling season and order volumes. Droughts, late or cold spring weather, and even too much rain could all influence sales. For example, a late spring could push March/April sales to May/June, thus potentially shifting seasonality between quarters from year to year. The Company’s entry into ESP safety shelters, contract manufacturing and the retail business with the Swisher factory outlet has significantly reduced the seasonality and reliance on favorable weather to stimulate outdoor power equipment sales.
 
5


Market Strategy
 
Swisher historically shipped product primarily to distribution centers that were supporting brick & mortar retailers. In recent years, however, the Company has re-focused efforts to marketing, selling and shipping directly to end-use consumers. This has reduced reliance on third party retailers, increased margins, and enabled the Company to establish its own relationship with the end customers. Swisher management has become proficient at all aspects of social media marketing, search engine optimization and managing consumer reviews. Swisher has a dedicated consumer solutions team which handles all customer questions and problems related to the Company’s products.
Competition
 
In the outdoor power equipment space, Swisher's largest competitor are Deere & Company, Husqvarna and Toro. In addition, in recent years there has been increasing competition from China in the lower-end spectrum of the market. As a niche manufacturer, Swisher has focused on product categories such as rough cut and finish cut tow behinds, where industry volumes are lower and thus don’t attract as much attention from the large competitors in the space. In the safety shelter space, the market is fragmented with a myriad of small regional competitors, including Survive A Storm, Ground Zero Shelters, Valley Storm Shelters, and Storm Safe Shelters among others.
CONSUMER FINANCE SEGMENT
 
General Description
 
The majority of short-term consumer loans we provide are commonly referred to as “payday loans” or “cash advance” loans. Such loans are referred to as “payday loans” because they are typically made to borrowers who have no available cash and promise to repay the loan out of their next paycheck. We also provide pawn loans. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we discontinued offering short-term installment loans.
 
We provide short-term consumer loans in amounts that typically range from $100 to $500, with the average loan amount, including fee, being approximately $474. Cash advance loans provide customers with cash in exchange for a promissory note with a maturity of generally two to four weeks and the customer’s post-dated personal check for the aggregate amount of the cash advance, plus a fee. The fee varies from state to state based on applicable regulations and generally ranges from $15 to $22 for each whole or partial increment of $100 borrowed. To repay the cash advance loan, a customer may pay with cash, in which case their personal check is returned to them, or allow the check to be presented to the bank for collection.
 
Approximately 91% and 92% of our Consumer Finance segment lending revenue (comprised of payday loan fees, installment loan interest through the first quarter of 2021 and pawn loan interest) was derived from payday lending in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Payday lending revenue made up approximately 64% and 71% of our total Consumer Finance segment revenue (comprised of lending revenue, check cashing fees, pawn store sales of merchandise and miscellaneous other revenue) in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
We operate three pawn stores in our Consumer Finance segment. Our pawn stores provide collateralized non-recourse loans, commonly known as “pawn loans” with maturities of one to four months. Allowable service charges vary by state and loan size. The loan amount varies depending on our valuation of each item pawned. We generally lend from 30% to 55% of our estimate of the collateral’s resale value. Customers have the option to redeem the pawned merchandise during the term or at maturity, or else forfeit the merchandise to us on maturity. At our pawn stores, we sell merchandise acquired through either customer forfeiture of pawn collateral, second-hand merchandise purchased from customers or consigned to us, or new merchandise purchased from vendors. Pawn store revenues made up approximately 31% and 23% of our total Consumer Finance segment revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
All of our Consumer Finance lending activities and other services are subject to state regulations (which vary from state to state), federal regulations and local regulations, where applicable.
 
As part of each payday loan transaction, we enter into a standardized written promissory note with the borrowing customer and obtain proof of income and identity, a personal post-dated check for the principal loan amount plus a specified fee, and other documentation. Our standardized contracts vary based on state laws, but all of our contracts plainly state in simple terms the annual percentage rate (assuming the fees we charge are computed as interest) in compliance with Regulation Z, the borrower’s right to rescind the transaction, a dispute-resolution clause, a notice of financial privacy rights, an affirmative representation about whether the borrower is a member of the U.S. military, and the consequences of defaulting on the loan. We retain copies of our written contracts and provide a signed copy to our customers.
 
In general, our lending process and standards are extraordinarily different from those used by banks. To our knowledge, banks typically order and carefully review credit reports on all loans, engage in extensive underwriting analysis, and will typically make independent verification of earnings history through phone calls, reviews of tax returns and other processes. As a result, we generally experience a higher default rate on our personal loans than banks do on their personal loans (see caption below, “Risks Associated with Our Loans—Default and Collection”). As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate (of all loan types) of approximately:
 

● | $1.92 million in current outstanding loan principal, fees and interest due to us; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | $0.44 million of late loans (customers’ repayment checks deposited and returned as NSF within the last 180 days). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fees We Charge
 
The fee we charge for a payday loan varies from state to state, based on applicable regulations, and generally ranges from $15 to $22 for each whole or partial increment of $100 borrowed. We do not charge interest in connection with our payday loans. If, however, we calculate the loan fees we charge as an annual percentage rate of interest (“APR”), such rate would range from 177% for a 31-day loan transacted in Kansas (on the low end) to approximately 536% for a 14-day loan in Wyoming (on the high end), with the actual average loan amount and average actual loan fees we charge involving an imputed annual percentage rate of approximately 439% and 198% for a 14-day and 31-day loan, respectively. The term of a loan significantly affects the imputed APR of the fees we charge for our loans. For instance, when a $15 fee is charged for a two-week loan of $100, the resulting APR is 391%. When the same fee on $100 is charged for a four-week loan, the resulting APR is 195%. Currently, we do not charge the maximum fee permitted in all of the states where we operate. We do, however, charge a uniform fee for all transactions processed in any particular state that involve the same range of payday loan amounts and the same term.
 
Of the four states in which we presently operate payday loan stores, each limits the loan fees we may charge and the term (i.e., the length) of the loan we may offer our customers.
 
We also offer pawn loans in Nebraska and Iowa. Allowable service charges for pawn loans vary by state and loan size. Our pawn loans earn 20% per month for loans under $1,000 and our average pawn loan amount typically ranges between $10 and $250, although it may range as high as $5,000. The loan amount varies depending on our estimated value of each item pawned.
 
Many states have laws limiting the amount of fees that may be charged in connection with any lending transaction (including payday and pawn lending transactions) when calculated as an APR, and some states expressly prohibit payday lending. These limitations, combined with other limitations and restrictions, effectively prohibit us from utilizing our present business model for cash advance or “payday” lending in those jurisdictions. In addition, the federal “2007 Military Authorization Act” prohibits lenders from offering or making payday loans (or similar lending transactions) to members of the U.S. military when the interest or fees exceed a 36% APR. Like the state limitations discussed above, this limitation effectively prohibits us from providing our cash advance or “payday” lending to members of the U.S. military. As a result of these restrictions, we do not conduct business with U.S. military personnel.
 
The above-described payday fees are the only fees we assess and collect from our customers for payday loans. Nevertheless, we also charge a flat fee that ranges from $15 to $40 (depending on the state) for returned checks in the event that a post-dated check we attempt to cash as repayment for our loan is returned.
 
Extensions or “Rollovers” of Payday Loans
 
Most states prohibit payday lenders from extending or refinancing a payday loan. Nevertheless, one state in which we presently provide payday loans (North Dakota) permits a loan to be extended or “rolled over” once.
 
When a customer “rolls over” or extends the term of an outstanding loan, when permitted by state law, we treat that rollover or extension as a brand new loan and we again charge the above-described loan fee for that transaction. This rollover has no effect on the imputed APR of the loan in those cases where the extended term is equal to the initial term of the loan. For example, a $100 four-week loan that costs $20 to obtain is the APR equivalent of 261%. If a customer extends the term of that loan for an additional four-week period, the customer will have paid $40 total in fees to obtain the $100 eight-week loan—which is again the APR equivalent of 261%. In cases where a customer (1) extends or rolls over a loan for a length of time that is less than the original loan or (2) repays the extended loan prior to the expiration of the fully extended term, the imputed APR will increase. For example, if a customer who obtained an initial $100 four-week loan for $20 in loan fees (the APR equivalent of 261%) later extends the term of that loan for only two additional weeks and pays the additional $20 loan fee, that customer will have borrowed $100 for a six-week period at a total cost of $40—which is the APR equivalent of 347%. We do not charge any interest on the unpaid fee from the initial term of the loan because, as a condition to agreeing to a loan extension, we will only accept cash payment of the fee for extending the loan.
 
Risks Associated With Our Loans—Default and Collection
 
Ordinarily, our customers approach us for a loan because they currently have insufficient funds to meet their present obligations, and so rarely, if ever, do our customers have sufficient funds in their checking accounts to cover the personal post-dated checks they provide us at the time of the loan transaction. The nature of our payday loan transactions presents a number of risks, including the ultimate risk that the loan will not be paid back.
 
7


In addition, we do not obtain security for our payday loans principally because, even assuming our customers would have potential collateral to offer as security for a payday loan, the small size of each particular lending transaction does not justify the time, effort and expense of identifying the collateral and properly obtaining a security interest in such collateral. As a consequence, all of our payday loans are unsecured. This means that, absent court or other legal action compelling a customer to repay our loans, we rely principally on the willingness and ability of our customers to repay amounts they owe us. In this regard, in many cases the costs of merely attempting to collect the amounts owed to us exceed the amounts we would seek to collect—making it impractical to take formal legal action against a defaulted borrower.
 
When a customer defaults on a loan, we engage in collection practices that include contacting the customer for repayment and the customer’s bank to determine whether funds are available to satisfy their personal post-dated check. If funds are available, we present the check to the bank for repayment and an official check from the bank is obtained to pay off the item. The costs involved in these initial collection efforts are minimal and involve some employee time and possibly a flat $15-30 bank fee to cover the cost of the cashier’s check. If funds are not available, we generally attempt to collect returned checks for up to 90 days (or up to 180 days in cases where a bank account is still active and the customer has not initiated a stop payment on the postdated check provided), principally through continued attempts to contact the customer. If our attempts remain unsuccessful after 90 (or 180) days, we generally assign the item to a collection agency. Assignment to a collection agency may cost us 30-40% of the amount eventually collected (if any) from the customer. Ordinarily, we do not recoup any costs of collection from our customers.
 
Over the past 12 months, using a 24 month lookback period for a given month, we collect anywhere from 64% - 68% of the amount of all returned checks, which results in approximately 2.02% of our total payday loan principal and fee volume being uncollectible. In 2021 and 2020, we generated approximately 56,000 and 84,000 payday loan transactions, respectively.
 
Industry Information
 
The total size of the check cashing & payday loan industry is estimated to be a $19.1 billion in 2022 according to industry statistics reported by IBISWorld (4/30/21). In a December 2017 study by the Center for Financial Services Innovation (“2017 Financially Underserved Market Size Study”), it was reported that consumers spent approximately $3.2 billion on fees for single payment loan products from storefront payday lenders in 2016, compared to $3.6 billion in 2015. This year-over-year decline continues a trend that is expected to continue going forward. According to the Community Financial Services Association of America (“CFSA”) website, industry analysts estimate that 12 million U.S. households use short-term payday advances each year in 35 states, and estimate that there are 20,600 payday advance locations across the United States, which extend approximately $38.5 billion in short-term credit to households experiencing cash-flow shortfalls. In addition to being a valuable source of credit for many consumers, the payday loan industry makes significant contributions to the U.S. and state economies, employing more than 50,000 Americans who earn $2 billion in wages and generating more than $2.6 billion in federal, state, and local taxes. Industry trends indicate that there will likely be a net decrease in total payday lending stores over the next few years due to store closings resulting from a combination of regulatory or legal changes, regulatory pressures, a slowdown in new store growth, and general economic conditions.
Predatory Lending and Regulatory Concerns
 
In general, the payday lending industry suffers from the perception and widespread belief that payday lenders are, by their nature, predatory lenders, offering loans to low-income and poorly educated consumers at costs that are too high to be good for consumers. This perception and belief results in frequent efforts in the U.S. Congress and various state legislatures, often proposed by consumer advocacy groups and lobbyists for traditional financial institutions such as banks, to further regulate and restrict or prohibit payday lending outright. See “Item 1A – Risk Factors” for further information regarding regulatory risks.
 
We do not believe payday lending is predatory, nor do we believe that our loans are too costly for consumers if they are judiciously obtained. In fact, we believe that bank overdraft fees by themselves are typically far more costly for consumers, and bouncing a check can often involve other negative consequences such as independent fees levied by the parties to whom a bad check is written, negative publicity, etc. In a January 13, 2022 article published by “moneyunder30.com”, it was reported that the median overdraft fee among retail banks is $34, and the majority of overdraft fees are incurred on transactions of $24 or less. Also, consumers repaid most overdrafts within three days. In other words, a $24 loan, repaid in three days, with a $34 overdraft fee would represent an APR of 17,000%. In sum, we believe that many of the bad perceptions about our industry are fueled primarily by:

Seasonality
 
Our Consumer Finance segment results are subject to seasonality, with the first and fourth quarters typically being our strongest periods as a result of broader economic factors, such as holiday spending habits at the end of each year and income tax refunds during the first quarter.

Competition
 
Like most other payday lenders, we believe that the primary competitive factors in our business are location and customer service. We face intense competition in an industry with relatively low barriers to entry, and we believe that the payday lending markets are becoming more competitive as the industry matures and consolidates. We compete with other payday lending and check cashing stores, and with financial service entities and retail businesses that offer payday loans or similar financial services. For example, we consider credit card companies that offer payday features, credit unions, banks that offer small loans, and creditors and loan services that can extend payment terms on outstanding loans to be our competitors. In addition, we compete in part with services offered by traditional financial institutions, most notably with respect to the “overdraft protection” services those institutions may offer and the charges they levy for checks written with insufficient funds.
 
Additional areas of competition have arisen. Businesses offer loans over the Internet as well as “loans by phone,” and these services compete with the services we offer. There also has been increasing penetration of electronic banking and related services into the check cashing and money transfer industry, including direct deposit of payroll checks, payroll or debit cards, stored-value cards, prepaid credit and debit cards, and electronic transfer of government benefits.
 
We also believe that customer service is critical to developing loyalty. In our industry, we believe that quality customer service means:
 

● | assisting with the loan application process and helping our customers understand the loan terms; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | treating customers respectfully; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | processing transactions with accuracy, efficiency and speed.

Our competitors for pawn store merchandise sales include numerous retail and wholesale stores, including jewelry stores, discount retail stores, consumer electronics stores, other pawn stores, other resale stores, electronic commerce retailers and auction sites.
 
The pawn industry in the United States is large and highly fragmented. The industry consists of approximately 13,000 pawn stores owned primarily by independent operators who own one to three locations. We consider the industry relatively mature. The three largest pawn store operators account for approximately 10% of the total estimated pawn stores in the United States.
 
Effect of General Economic Conditions on our Consumer Finance Segment
 
Our business has experienced fluctuating changes in our provision for loan losses in recent years, significantly impacted by the amount loaned by loan types where installment lending carried a higher forfeiture rate. We are uncertain how the current economic conditions will affect demand for our services or our loan losses after 2022.
 
Credit and financing available to us and our industry have been negatively impacted by recent federal and state legislation and regulation, including the overall negative perception associated with payday lending. For example, we are aware of federal and state regulatory pressures being exerted on our banking relationships due to the negative perception about payday lending. For more information, see “Regulation - Regulation of Consumer Financing Activities” below.
 
REGULATION 
 
We are subject to regulations by federal, state and local governments that affect the products and services we provide. Generally, these regulations are designed to protect consumers who use our services and are not designed to protect our shareholders.
Regulation of Consumer Financing Activities
 
In those states where we currently operate consumer finance activities, we are licensed as a payday lender or pawn broker where required and are subject to various state regulations regarding the terms and conditions of our payday and pawn loans and our lending policies, procedures and operations. In some states, payday lending is referred to as “deferred presentment,” “cash advance loans,” “deferred deposit loans,” or “consumer installment loans.” State regulations normally limit the amount that we may lend to any single consumer and may limit the number of loans that we may make to any consumer at one time or in the course of a single year. State regulations also limit the amount of fees that we may assess in connection with any loan transaction and may limit a customer’s ability to extend or “rollover” a loan with us. State regulations often specify minimum and maximum maturity dates for payday loans and, in some cases, specify mandatory cooling-off periods between transactions.
 
Our payday lending practices must also comply with the disclosure requirements of the Federal Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z under that Act. Our collection activities for delinquent loans are generally subject to consumer protection laws regulating debt-collection practices. Finally, our payday lending business subjects us to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

During the last several years, legislation has been introduced and passed in the U.S. Congress and in certain state legislatures proposing or effecting various restrictions or an outright prohibition on payday or certain installment lending and consumer advocacy groups in many states are actively seeking state law changes which would effectively end the viability of a payday loan business. Currently, state laws in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, and South Dakota have effectively eliminated the ability to conduct payday and certain installment lending in those states. In 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which consolidated most federal regulation of financial services offered to consumers, and replaced the Office of Thrift Supervision’s seat on the FDIC Board. Almost all credit providers, including mortgage lenders, providers of payday loans, other nonbank financial companies, and banks and credit unions with assets over $10 billion, are subject to regulations and oversight by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). While the CFPB does not have authority to make rules limiting interest rates or fees charged, the scope and extent of its authority are broad enough to impose limits on rollovers and extensions of payday loans, as well as compliance with federal rules and regulations.
 
After several years of research, debate, and public hearings, in October 2017, the CFPB adopted a new rule for payday lending. The 2017 rule, originally scheduled to go into effect in August 2019, would have imposed significant restrictions on the industry, and at the time it was expected that a large number of lenders would be forced to close their stores. The CFPB’s studies projected a reduction in the number of lenders by 50%, while industry studies forecasted a much higher attrition rate if the rule were to be implemented as originally adopted. Included in the new rule were requirements for vetting borrowers (i.e., obtaining a credit report and performing basic underwriting procedures), limits on the number of loans a consumer could obtain in a 12-month period, limiting to two the number of times a consumer’s check may be presented to the consumer’s bank for payment, and provisions requiring paydowns by the consumer on successive loans. However, in January 2018, the CFPB issued a statement that it intended to “reconsider” the regulation and delayed the August 19, 2019 compliance date for the other provisions to November 19, 2020. In July 2020, the CFPB issued a final rule applicable to the 2017 rule. The final rule rescinded the mandatory underwriting provisions of the 2017 rule but did not rescind or alter the payments provisions of the 2017 rule. The CFPB will seek to have these rules go into effect with a reasonable period for lenders to come into compliance.

Financial Reporting Regulation
 
Regulations promulgated by the United States Department of the Treasury under the Bank Secrecy Act require us to report all transactions involving currency in an amount greater than $10,000. Generally, every financial institution must report each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment or transfer that involves an amount greater than $10,000. In addition, multiple currency transactions must be treated as a single transaction if we have knowledge that the transactions are by or on behalf of any one person and result, in a single business day, in the transfer of cash in or out totaling more than $10,000. In addition, the regulations require us to maintain information concerning sales of monetary instruments for cash in amounts from $3,000 to $10,000. The Bank Secrecy Act requires us, under certain circumstances, to file a suspicious activity report.
 
The Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 requires us to register with the United States Department of the Treasury as a money service business. Money service businesses include check cashers and sellers of money orders. Money service businesses must renew their registrations every two years, maintain a list of their agents, update the agent list annually, and make the agent list available for examination.
 
Finally, we have established various procedures designed to comply, and we continue to monitor and evaluate our business methods and procedures to ensure compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act.
 
Privacy Regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations restricting the use and seeking to protect the confidentiality of customer identity and other personal nonpublic customer information. We have identified our systems that capture and maintain nonpublic personal information, as that term is understood under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and associated regulations. We disclose our public information policies to our customers as required by that law. We also have systems in place intended to safeguard this information as required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which specifically governs certain aspects of our payday lending business.

Technology and Information
 
We maintain integrated systems of retail points of sale and management software applications and platforms for processing the various types of financial transactions we offer. These systems provide us with customer service, internal control mechanisms, record-keeping and reporting information. These systems are designed to provide summary, detailed and exception information to various levels of management.
Security
 
We believe the principal security risks to our Consumer Finance and Cellular Retail segments are robbery and employee theft. We have established extensive security and management information systems to address both areas of potential loss. To protect against robbery, most payday lending store employees work behind bullet-resistant glass, and the back office, safe and computer areas are locked and closed to customers. Security measures utilized in our retail locations include mechanical safes, electronic alarm systems monitored by third parties or remote-controlled systems, control over entry to customer service representative, motion detection devices, locked cases, and, at times, the use of professional security services. Consumer Finance segment employees also use cellular phones to ensure safety and security whenever they are outside secured areas.
 
We implemented critical safeguarding controls, including daily cash and deposit monitoring, unannounced audits of cash and inventory items, and requiring immediate responses from our staff when irregularities in cash balances are discovered. We primarily self-insure for employee theft and dishonesty at the store level.
 
We regularly receive and store information about our customers, vendors and other third parties. We have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties or through open-source solutions may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceiving our team members, contractors, and vendors. The Company retains outside cyber-security experts to assist us in preventing security breaches of our sensitive information from cyber incidents and hacking.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 950 employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is good, and we have not suffered any work stoppages or labor disputes. We do not have any employees that operate under collective-bargaining agreements.
