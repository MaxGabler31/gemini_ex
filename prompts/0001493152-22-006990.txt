Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing, acquiring, and commercializing innovative pharmaceutical products that fulfill an unmet patient need. Since the formation of our company in 2017, we have used our expertise in business development, regulatory, and product development to assemble a diversified portfolio of eleven products and product candidates. Six of our products have been approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) and commercially launched, and an additional four product candidates have been submitted to the FDA. We plan to continue growing our business through the acquisition of additional late-stage, high-value product candidates.
Product Portfolio
 
Our product portfolio is comprised of three categories: Orphan Drugs, Hospital Products, and Royalty Products.
 
Orphan Drugs 
 
Our orphan drug product category is focused on commercializing products that treat the unmet needs of patients suffering from rare diseases. As defined by the FDA, orphan drugs typically address diseases that impact fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States. Given these small patient populations, products are typically promoted with small, targeted sales forces and distributed through high-touch specialty pharmacies that provide comprehensive services to patients or caregivers. We expect to continue to grow our orphan drug product category. Some of our orphan drug products include:
 
Alkindi Sprinkle® (hydrocortisone granules) - This product was approved by the FDA in September 2020 as a replacement therapy for Adrenocortical Insufficiency (“AI”) in children under 17 years of age. The product is the first and only FDA-approved granule hydrocortisone formulation for the treatment of AI designed for use in children. We acquired U.S. marketing rights to the product in March 2020 and launched Alkindi Sprinkle in December 2020 with a sales force targeting pediatric endocrinologists. In November 2021, we entered into a co-promotion agreement with Tolmar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Tolmar”) to use their 60+ person salesforce to promote Alkindi Sprinkle. Tolmar’s sales force will promote Alkindi Sprinkle to pediatric endocrinology healthcare professionals and Tolmar will receive a royalty on net sales growth above the product’s baseline sales level at the time of the transaction. Eton retains ownership of the product and will maintain responsibility for all non-sales force related commercial activities. We believe there are approximately 10,000 children currently suffering from AI in the United States. Alkindi Sprinkle is protected by four issued patents that extend to 2034. In January 2021, we announced the acquisition of Canadian rights to Alkindi Sprinkle and we expect to pursue regulatory approval of the product in Canada in the near future.
 
Carglumic Acid tablets - Our Carglumic Acid product is the first and only FDA-approved generic version of Carbaglu®. Our product is approved for the treatment of acute and chronic hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate Synthase (NAGS) deficiency. We acquired marketing rights to the product in October 2021 and launched the product in December 2021. We promote the product with our internal sales force. The product was awarded Competitive Generic Therapy (CGT) designation by the FDA, which provides us with 180 days of generic exclusivity. We believe that the Carbaglu® market is more than $50 million annually and our goal is to capture 25% to 35% of the market.
 
Dehydrated Alcohol Injection. Our dehydrated alcohol injection product candidate for the treatment of methanol poisoning was submitted to the FDA and was granted Orphan Drug Exclusivity in late 2020. In May 2021, we received a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the FDA. We believe all of the items raised by the CRL are addressable, and we plan to submit our response to the FDA in the near future. We believe the dehydrated alcohol injection market is more than $50 million annually.
 
Zeneo® Hydrocortisone Autoinjector. Our Zeneo hydrocortisone autoinjector product candidate is a proprietary needle-free autoinjector under development for the treatment of adrenal crisis. We acquired the product candidate from Crossject in June 2021. Currently patients suffering from adrenal crisis typically use Solu-Cortef, a lyophilized hydrocortisone injection kit that must be reconstituted prior to delivery. The current market for Solu-Cortef is more than $75 million annually based on IQVIA data. We believe our needle-free autoinjector will be preferred by patients. We expect to submit a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for the product in 2023, which could allow for FDA approval in 2024.

Hospital Products
 
Our hospital products category consists of injectable products that are used in the hospital setting. These include:
 
Biorphen® (phenylephrine HCl). Biorphen is the first and only FDA-approved formulation of ready-to-use phenylephrine injection. Biorphen is indicated for the treatment of clinically important hypotension resulting primarily from vasodilation in the setting of anesthesia. We acquired U.S. marketing rights to the product in February 2019. The product was approved in October 2019 and launched in December 2019. We estimate the current addressable market for ready-to-use phenylephrine to be more than twenty million units of Biorphen annually. Biorphen primarily competes with FDA-approved formulations of concentrated phenylephrine injection, which must be diluted prior to administration to patients, and with unapproved formulations of ready-to-use phenylephrine sold by 503B compounding pharmacies. Eton owns the Biorphen NDA, but the product is currently promoted by Xellia Pharmaceuticals’ (“Xellia”) hospital sales force under a co-promotion agreement. Eton pays Xellia a commission on sales of the product in certain channels. Eton retains the right to exit the co-promotion agreement under certain conditions. We are actively working on converting this product from its current ampule container to a vial. We expect to launch the vial presentation in 2022, which is expected to drastically increase the adoption of the product.
 
Rezipres® (ephedrine HCl). Rezipres is an innovative ready-to-use formulation of a molecule that is indicated for the treatment of clinically important hypotension occurring in the setting of anesthesia. Our product will compete against Emerphed® and non-FDA approved ready-to-use products from compounding facilities. Rezipres® provides a ready-to-use strength that can be immediately administered to patients, eliminating the need for calculations and additional dilution steps. Our product is also preservative free and does not contain any sulfites. This product was launched in March 2022. We have partnered with XGen Pharmaceuticals DJB (“XGen”) for commercialization of the product. XGen’s sales force is responsible for promoting the product to hospitals. We are actively working on converting the product from its current ampule container to a vial. We expect to launch the vial presentation in 2022.
 
Cysteine Injection. Our cysteine injection product candidate is a generic form of EXELA Pharma Sciences’ Elcys® product for which we have submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) to the FDA. We are actively engaged in the Paragraph IV litigation associated with the innovator company’s patent. Given our first-to-file status, we expect to be entitled to 180 days of generic exclusivity if we are successful in challenging the patent. The trial is expected to begin in March of 2022. We believe the current market for Cysteine injection is more than $50 million annually.
 
Royalty Products
 
Our royalty products category is comprised of products that Eton does not commercialize. In most cases, these are products that Eton initiated development of, or licensed at an early stage, and advanced development to an FDA submission before selling the product rights to a third party. These products are now owned and commercialized partners that pay Eton milestones and royalties on commercial sales. Our royalty products category strategy allows us to monetize our vast experience and talent in business development, regulatory activities, and product development to generate high returns on our financial investments without being restricted by commercial organization limitations and it does not require significant ongoing overhead support costs. We currently have four royalty products: Alway Preservative Free, which is owned and marketed by Bausch Health, and our three neurology oral liquid products, EPRONTIA™, Zonisamide oral suspension and Lamotrigine oral suspension, which are owned and marketed by Azurity Pharmaceuticals (“Azurity”).
 
Alaway® Preservative Free (ketotifen fumarate). Alaway Preservative Free is the first and only preservative-free ophthalmic product approved for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. The preservative-free formulation is designed to deliver an improved comfort profile to patients compared to currently available ketotifen ophthalmic products that contain preservatives. The product is sold via the over-the-counter channel. Currently, the market for ketotifen ophthalmic products is estimated to be more than $75 million annually based on data from IRI and IQVIA. We sold the product rights to Bausch Health in February 2019. Bausch Health is responsible for commercialization of the product which was launched in February 2021. We received a $1.5 million milestone payment in conjunction with the launch of the product and receive a twelve percent royalty on the product’s net sales.

Neurology Oral Liquids. Starting in 2018, we assembled a portfolio of three neurology oral liquid products through in-licensing and internal development. All three products are molecules that are widely used in oral solid forms to treat epilepsy, but were not FDA-approved in liquid formulations. We believe the formulations will be beneficial to patients suffering from dysphagia, which is prevalent among pediatric and geriatric patients. In addition, the liquid formulations offer precision dosing, which can provide patients and caregivers with accurate doses that are lower than or in between the limited strength doses available from oral solid products. We sold these three products to Azurity in February 2021. Under terms of the agreement, Azurity has paid us $17 million and will pay up to $25 million in additional milestone payments plus a single digit royalty on net sales of the products. Azurity has taken over ownership of the products and is responsible for all development, regulatory, and commercial activities. The three neurology oral liquid products are:
 
EPRONTIA™ (topiramate oral solution). EPRONTIA® is the only FDA-approved liquid formulation of topiramate. The product is approved for three indications, including: monotherapy for treatment of partial-onset or primary general tonic-clonic seizures in patients two years of age and older; adjunctive therapy for treatment of partial-onset seizures, including seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients two year of age and older; and as a preventive treatment of migraine in patients 12 years of age and older. The product was approved in November 2021 and launched by Azurity in December 2021. The current market for topiramate in oral form is more than $800 million annually according to IQVIA.
 
Zonisamide Oral Suspension. The product is an innovative liquid formulation of zonisamide under FDA review for the treatment of partial seizures in patients with epilepsy. The product application was originally assigned a PDUFA date of May 29, 2021 and the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter because it was unable to inspect the manufacturing site due to COVID-related travel restrictions. The FDA inspected the facility in January 2022, and we believe the application could be approved in the near future. The current market for zonisamide in oral form is more than $65 million annually according to IQVIA.
 
Lamotrigine for Oral Suspension. The product is an innovative liquid formulation of lamotrigine under FDA review for the treatment of partial on-set seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients two year of age and older. The product has been issued a patent, which is now owned by Azurity. The product’s NDA application received a Complete Response Letter in March 2020 and the FDA requested changes to the Dosage and Administration section of the product’s Prescribing Information to simplify the dosing information for intended users. The FDA requested a human factors validation study with the revised labeling to demonstrate that the intended users can prepare and administer the oral suspension safely and effectively. Our development partner completed the study and submitted the report to the FDA in November 2021. The application has been assigned a PDUFA date of May 30, 2022. The current market for lamotrigine in oral form is more than $600 million annually according to IQVIA.

Goals and Strengths
 
Our goal is to become a leading profitable pharmaceutical company that brings innovative treatments to patients. We believe we are unique in the pharmaceutical industry in our ability to identify, acquire, and advance products through the development and regulatory process. Our biggest competitive strengths are:

● | Business development experience– our ability to identify and execute transactions on under-appreciated development assets. Our team has completed over 150 business development transactions throughout their careers and their industry connections and track record provide the company with proprietary deal flow. We avoid participating in broker led transactions of auction processes. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Regulatory expertise – our knowledge and experience gaining FDA approval, and particularly our knowledge within the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which provides drug sponsors with the opportunity to leverage existing data or literature to drastically expedite drug development timelines and reduce investment. 

Sales and Marketing 
 
We currently own or have economic interests in six commercial products. We typically commercialize our orphan products under our own label with our internal infrastructure and sales force, however, we may at times supplement our efforts with a co-promotion arrangement as we have with Tolmar Pharmaceuticals on Alkindi Sprinkle. In our orphan product category, we currently commercialize Alkindi Sprinkle and Carglumic Acid in the United States. These products are distributed to patients via a specialty pharmacy, which supports customer service and reimbursement activities.
 
In our hospital category, we have entered into short-term co-promotion agreements for the ampule format of both Biorphen and Rezipres. We retain ownership of the products and have no commercial arrangements relating to the vial formats of both products. For each future product launch we will assess if it is more advantageous to promote internally with our own sales force or partner with a company with an existing hospital sales force.
 
In our royalty product category, the products are commercialized by our partners. Bausch Health is responsible for all sale and marketing activities related to Alaway Preservative Free, and Azurity is responsible for all sales and marketing activities related to Eprontia, zonisamide oral suspension, and lamotrigine suspension. In all cases we receive a royalty on net sales of the products


In January 2020 we signed a co-promotion agreement with Xellia for the promotion of Biorphen. Under terms of the agreement, Xellia’s U.S.-based hospital sales force will promote Biorphen in certain customer channels in exchange for a commission based on net sales realized at certain customer accounts. Eton owns the Biorphen NDA and the product is sold under Eton’s brand name. The agreement has a five-year term, but allows Eton to exit under various scenarios, including a change of control, and after 2021 if Biorphen net sales from Xellia designated accounts do not exceed $29.4 million in 2021, or $42.0 million in 2022 and the following years. In July 2021 we signed a co-promotion agreement with XGen whereby XGen’s salesforce will promote Rezipres for a three-year term, in exchange for a profit share on the Rezipres product. In November 2021 we signed a co-promotion agreement with Tolmar whereby Tolmar will promote Alkindi Sprinkle® through its 60+ person salesforce in exchange for a royalty on net sales.
 
Research and Development
 
We currently have seven employees that support our product research and development activities. In addition, we utilize external sources for various product development activities, including the resources of our product development partners for certain product candidates, and also through the use of contract laboratory services on a fee for service model.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) to manufacture our products. All our manufacturing partners are based in the United States or Europe. We seek to work with CMOs that have a long history of quality and FDA compliance. All products are manufactured in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Processes (“cGMP”), and our internal quality system requires us to enter quality agreements with and audit all of our manufacturers prior to commercializing the product. Our choice to rely on external manufacturers significantly reduces the amount of capital invested in our business and allows us the flexibility to pursue a broad range of opportunities beyond the specific capabilities of a single facility.
Intellectual Property
 
Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on our trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We vigorously defend our intellectual property to preserve our rights and gain the benefit of our technological investments. Our business is not dependent, however, upon any single patent, trademark or contract.

Alkindi Sprinkle is protected by four issued patents that extend to 2034. We intend to seek patent protection on our internally developed products as circumstances warrant.
 
Our development partners for zonisamide and topiramate have filed patent applications on those products and our development partner for lamotrigine was granted a patent by the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the product’s unique formulation. We expect the lamotrigine patent to be Orange Book listed after product approval. These patents were assigned to Azurity in February 2021.
 
Government Regulations and Funding
 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by foreign, federal, state and local agencies, such as the FDA, and various European regulatory authorities. The manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are subject to government regulation in the United States and various foreign countries. Additionally, in the United States, we must follow rules and regulations established by the FDA requiring the presentation of data indicating that our products are safe and efficacious and are manufactured in accordance with cGMP regulations. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products, and we may be criminally prosecuted. We, our manufacturers and contract research organizations (“CROs”) may also be subject to regulations under other foreign, federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act and import, export and customs regulations as well as the laws and regulations of other countries. The U.S. government has increased its enforcement activity regarding illegal marketing practices domestically and internationally. As a result, pharmaceutical companies must ensure their compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act.
 
These regulatory requirements impact our operations and differ from one country to another, so that securing the applicable regulatory approvals of one country does not imply the approval of another country. The approval procedures involve high costs and are manpower intensive, usually extend over many years and require highly skilled and professional resources.
 
FDA Market Approval Process
 
The steps required to be taken before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally include:
 

● | completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | completion of required chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing; 
● | the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, the application for which must be evaluated and found acceptable by the FDA before human clinical trials may commence; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
● | submission and approval of an NDA; and 
● | agreement with FDA of the language on the package insert. 

 
Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, what types of patients may enter the study, schedules of tests and procedures, drugs, dosages, and length of study, as well as the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND process.
 
Clinical trials are usually conducted in three phases. Phase 1 clinical trials are normally conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers to assess safety of various dosing regimens and pharmacokinetics. After a safe dose has been established, in Phase 2 clinical trials the drug is administered to small populations of sick patients to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease or condition and to continue to assess safety. Phase 3 clinical trials are usually multi-center, double-blind controlled trials in larger numbers of subjects at various sites to assess as fully as possible both the safety and effectiveness of the drug.

-


Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practices (“GCP”) requirements. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical study at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. An institutional review board (“IRB”) generally must approve the clinical trial design and patient informed consent at study sites that the IRB oversees and also may halt a study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group recommends whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical study sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 
As a product candidate moves through the clinical testing phases, manufacturing processes are further defined, refined, controlled and validated. The level of control and validation required by the FDA increases as clinical studies progress. We and the third-party manufacturers on which we rely for the manufacture of our product candidates and their respective components (including the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”)) are subject to requirements that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with cGMP. To comply with cGMP requirements, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to meet requirements relating to personnel, facilities, equipment, production and process, labeling and packaging, quality control, recordkeeping and other requirements.
 
Assuming completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information on the product candidate is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications, together with payment of a user fee, unless waived. An NDA includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 
If an NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) the FDA’s goal is to complete its initial review and respond to the applicant within ten months of submission, unless the application relates to an unmet medical need, or is for a serious or life-threatening indication, in which case the goal may be within six months of NDA submission. However, the review process and the target response date under PDUFA may be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the NDA. During its review of an NDA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. Data from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA and/or any advisory committee it appoints may interpret data differently than the applicant.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and inspects manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it will either approve commercial marketing of the drug product with prescribing information for specific indications or issue a CRL indicating that the application is not ready for approval and stating the conditions that must be met in order to secure approval of the NDA. If the CRL requires additional data and the applicant subsequently submits that data, the FDA nevertheless may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing. Such post-marketing testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and efficacy after approval.

If the FDA approves one of our product candidates, we will be required to comply with a number of post-approval regulatory requirements. We would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. If we seek to make certain changes to an approved product, such as certain manufacturing changes, we will need FDA review and approval before the change can be implemented. For example, if we change the manufacturer of a product or our API, the FDA may require stability or other data from the new manufacturer, and such data will take time and are costly to generate, and the delay associated with generating these data may cause interruptions in our ability to meet commercial demand, if any. While physicians may use products for indications that have not been approved by the FDA, we may not label or promote the product for an indication that has not been approved. Securing FDA approval for new indications is similar to the process for approval of the original indication and requires, among other things, submitting data from adequate and well-controlled studies that demonstrate the product’s safety and efficacy in the new indication. Even if such studies are conducted, the FDA may not approve any change in a timely fashion, or at all.
 
The FDA may also require post-marketing testing, or Phase 4 testing, as well as risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions or an approval that could otherwise restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 
We intend to submit applications for certain product candidates via the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. As an alternate path for FDA approval of new indications or new formulations of previously approved products, a company may submit a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, instead of a “stand-alone” or “full” NDA. Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Some examples of products that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs that have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit the applicant to rely upon certain published nonclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product or the FDA’s conclusions from prior review of such studies. The FDA may require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the labeled indications for which the reference product has been approved, as well as for any new indication supported by the Section 505(b)(2) application. While references to nonclinical and clinical data not generated by the applicant or for which the applicant does not have a right of reference are allowed, all development, process, stability, qualification and validation data related to the manufacturing and quality of the new product must be included in an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2).
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference product has expired. If the Orange Book certifications outlined above are not accomplished, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its products only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its products may be commercialized.
 
Section 505(j) Abbreviated New Drug Applications
 
The 505(j) pathway is used for product candidates that are therapeutically equivalent to an approved product. The underlying premise of the 505(j) pathway is that a product candidate classified as therapeutically equivalent can be substituted for the approved product with the full expectation that the substituted product will produce the same clinical effect and safety profile as the approved product when administered under the same conditions. A product candidate utilizing the 505(j) pathway requires an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, which relies on the FDA’s finding that the previously approved drug candidate is safe and effective. An ANDA generally must contain information to show that the product candidate is the same as the approved product with respect to API, conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, strength and labeling, with certain permissible differences, and is the bioequivalent of the approved drug. The 505(j) pathway typically requires no clinical testing other than a bioequivalence trial. While the 505(j) pathway is typically shorter and less expensive than the 505(b)(2) pathway, the 505(b)(2) pathway allows greater flexibility as to the characteristics of the product candidate.

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
For products distributed in the United States, we will also be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:

● | The U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, lease, or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the U.S. False Claims Act, can be enforced by individuals, on behalf of the government, through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and the civil monetary penalties law, prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
● | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which prohibits, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services; 
● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
● | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
● | Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives; and state and foreign laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal or state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.

Reimbursement
 
Sales of our products in the United States may depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, (the “MMA”), imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
 
Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce physician usage of the products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the health care system that could prevent or delay marketing approval pharmaceutical products, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidates. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products.
 
For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, (collectively, the “Health Care Reform Law”) was enacted, which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Health Care Reform Law, among other things, imposed reporting requirements on manufacturers related to drug samples and financial relationships with physicians and teaching hospitals, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and established a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program.

Some of the provisions of the Health Care Reform Law have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law. In addition, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Health Care Reform Law. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Health Care Reform Law have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Health Care Reform Law on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the Health Care Reform, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Health Care Reform Law is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the ruling has no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform will impact the Health Care Reform Law.
 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. These changes include, among others, aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year and an increase in the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 
Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, in President Biden’s 2022 State of the Union Speech, President Biden again called for Congress to take action to combat high prices of prescription drugs. In 2019, the Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some of these and other proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and government administration officials have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.

Risk Factor Summary
 
You should carefully consider the risks set forth in the section of this Annual Report of Form 10-K entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 16 of this Annual Report, including, but not limited to, the following:

● | We are a specialty pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history, and it is difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our business is adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the impact could be material. 
● | We may have significant research, regulatory and development expenses as we advance our product candidates. 
● | We may need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth. 
● | If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. 
● | We may acquire businesses or products, or form strategic alliances, in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such acquisitions. 
● | We rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. 
● | Sales of counterfeits of any of our product candidates, as well as unauthorized sales of any of our product candidates, may have adverse effects on our revenues, business and results of operations and damage our brand and reputation. 
● | We have entered into several arrangements with related parties for the development and marketing of certain product candidates and these arrangements present potential conflicts of interest. 
● | We face competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively. 
● | Our competitors may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for comparable products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, and the risk of our competitors doing so may lead us to develop drug candidates without disclosing certain information with regard to such candidates. 
● | If we are not able to obtain any required regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidate and our ability to generate revenue will be limited. 
● | If the FDA does not conclude that our product candidates satisfy the requirements for the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for our product candidates will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and encounter significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in any case may not be successful. 
● | An NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) subjects us to the risk that we may be subject to a patent infringement lawsuit that would delay or prevent the review or approval of our product candidate. 
● | Even if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the product, and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, may be limited. 
● | We are subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates. 
● | Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our products may inhibit sales of affected products.

● | Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to penetrate international markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties. 
● | If we market any of our products or product candidates in a manner that violates health care fraud and abuse laws, or if we violate government price reporting laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties. 
● | We may not be able to establish agreements with third parties with whom we wish to collaborate and, if we are able to establish them, we may not be able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms, which could result in alterations or delays of our development and commercialization plans. 
● | We expect to rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates and our business would be substantially harmed. 
● | We enter into various contracts in the normal course of our business, some or all of which may require us to indemnify the other party to the contract. In the event we have to perform under these indemnification provisions, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
● | Our Chief Executive Officer holds ownership interest in some of the third parties we have entered into agreements with. The terms and fee arrangements of these agreements, we believe, approximate the terms and fee arrangements of an agreement that would have been obtained in an arm’s length and unaffiliated transaction. Nonetheless, this may expose us to claims of interested transactions and other fiduciary suits. 
● | Any termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, any necessary studies of any of our product candidates for any indications could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects. 
● | Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. 
● | Third-party coverage and reimbursement and health care cost containment initiatives and treatment guidelines may constrain our future revenues. 
● | We are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to data privacy, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business. 
● | We will depend on rights to certain pharmaceutical compounds that have been acquired by us. We do not have complete control over these pharmaceutical compounds and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from selling our products. 
● | It is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we cannot ensure the protection of these rights. 
● | Changes in either U.S. or foreign patent law or interpretation of such laws could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products. 
● | Our product candidates may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could increase our costs and delay or prevent our development and commercialization efforts. 
● | Others may claim an ownership interest in our intellectual property, which could expose us to litigation and have an adverse effect on our prospects. 
● | We may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.
