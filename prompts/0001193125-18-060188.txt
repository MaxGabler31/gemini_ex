ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General 
 ACI Worldwide, Inc. (ACI, ACI Worldwide, the Company, we, us, or our) is a Delaware corporation incorporated in November 1993 under the name ACI Holding, Inc. ACI is largely the successor to Applied Communications, Inc. and Applied Communications Inc. Limited, which we acquired from Tandem Computers Incorporated on December 31, 1993. On July 24, 2007, we changed our corporate name from Transaction Systems Architects, Inc. to ACI Worldwide, Inc. We have been marketing our products and services under the ACI Worldwide brand since 1993 and have gained significant market recognition under this brand name. 
 We develop, market, install, and support a broad line of software products and solutions primarily focused on facilitating real-time electronic payments. Our payment capabilities, technologies, and solutions are marketed under the brand name Universal Payments, or UP, which describes the breadth and depth of ACIs product offerings. UP defines ACIs enterprise or universal payments capabilities targeting any channel, any network, and any payment type. ACI UP solutions empower customers to regain control, choice, and flexibility in todays complex payments environment, get to market more quickly, and reduce operational costs. 
 These products and services are used globally by banks, financial intermediariessuch as third-party electronic payment processors, payment associations, switch interchanges, merchants, and corporates, and a wide range of transaction-generating endpoints, including automated teller machines (ATM), merchant point-of-sale (POS) terminals, bank branches, mobile phones, tablets, corporations, and internet commerce sites. The authentication, authorization, switching, settlement, fraud-checking, and reconciliation of electronic payments is a complex activity due to the large number of locations and variety of sources from which transactions can be generated, the large number of participants in the market, high transaction volumes, geographically dispersed networks, differing types of authorization, and varied reporting requirements. These activities are typically performed online and are conducted 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
 ACI combines a global perspective with local presence to tailor electronic payment solutions for our customers. We believe that we have one of the most diverse and robust electronic payment product portfolios in the industry with application software spanning the entire payments value chain. We also believe that our strong financial performance has been attributable to our ability to design and deliver quality products and solutions coupled with our ability to identify and successfully consummate and integrate strategic acquisitions. 
 Fiscal 2016 Divestiture 
 On March 3, 2016, we completed the sale of our CFS assets and liabilities to Fiserv. The transaction included employee agreements and customer contracts as well as technology assets and intellectual property. The sale of CFS assets and liabilities enabled us to focus resources on our strategic products and new high-growth initiatives in support of large banks, merchants, and corporates worldwide. 
Recent Acquisitions 
 Fiscal 2015 Acquisition 
 PAY.ON 
 On November 4, 2015, we completed the acquisition of PAY.ON AG and its subsidiaries (PAY.ON). PAY.ON was a leader in eCommerce payments gateway solutions to payment service providers globally. Their advanced platform-based solution complements and strengthens the Companys UP Merchant Payments and UP eCommerce Payments. The combined entities provide customers the ability to deliver a seamless omni-channel customer payment experience in store, mobile, and online. 
Target Markets
 ACIs comprehensive electronic payment solutions serve four key markets:
 Banks
 ACI provides payment solutions to large banks globally for both retail banking and transaction banking services. Our solutions transform banks complex payment environments to speed time to market, reduce costs, and deliver a consistent experience to customers across channels while enabling them to prevent and rapidly react to fraudulent activity. In addition, we enable banks to meet the requirements of different real-time payment schemes and to quickly create differentiated products to meet consumer, business, and merchant demands.
 Financial intermediaries
 ACIs payment solutions support financial intermediaries, such as processors, networks, payment service providers (PSPs), and new financial technology (FinTech) entrants. We offer these customers scalable solutions that strategically position them to innovate and achieve growth and cost efficiency, while protecting them against fraud. Our solutions also allow new entrants in the digital marketplace to access innovative payment schemes, such as the U.K. Faster Payments New Access Model.

Merchants
 ACIs support of merchants globally includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 merchants, online-only merchants and the PSPs, independent selling organizations (ISOs), value added resellers (VARs), and acquirers who service them. These customers operate in a variety of verticals, including general merchandise, grocery, hospitality, dining, transportation, and others. Our solutions provide merchants with a secure, omni-channel payments platform that gives them independence from third-party payment providers. We also offer secure solutions to online-only merchants that provide consumers with a convenient and seamless way to shop.
Corporates
 Within the corporate segment, ACI provides electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) services to companies operating in the consumer finance, insurance, healthcare, higher education, tax, and utility categories. Our solutions enable these customers to support a wide range of payment options and provide a painless consumer payments experience that drives consumer loyalty and increases revenue.
Solutions 
 ACIs UP solutions span the payments ecosystem to support the electronic payment needs of banks, financial intermediaries, merchants and corporates. Our six strategic solution areas include the following: 
Retail Payments 
 ACI offers comprehensive consumer payment solutions ranging from core payment engines to back-office support that enable banks and financial intermediaries to compete effectively in todays real-time, open payments ecosystem.

 Merchant Payments 
 ACI provides real-time, any-to-any payment capabilities globally in both card-present and card-not-present environments. 
 UP Merchant Payments solution provides merchants with a vendor-agnostic, flexible and secure omni-channel payments environment through an integration of Postilion, ACI ReD Shield and ACI PAY.ON Payments Gateway. Postilion facilitates transactions generated at the point of purchase, as well as back-office functions, including prepaid, debit and credit card processing, ACH processing, electronic benefits transfer, card issuance and management, check authorization, customer loyalty programs and returned check collection.

 fraud across all payment types, as well as an interactive, self-service business intelligence portal for deep insight into merchant fraud activity. Lastly, the PAY.ON Payments Gateway delivers global payments connectivity through eCommerce and mCommerce channels, including a network of more than 350 card acquirer and alternative payment methods.
 UP eCommerce Payments solution is designed for PSPs, ISOs, VARs, acquirers and others that offer payment services to their merchant customer base. The cloud-based solution integrates PAY.ON Payments Gateway and ReD Shield, and is available as a white-label product.
 Payments Intelligence
 ACIs big data engine uses powerful analytics to deliver robust fraud prevention and detection capabilities to bank, financial intermediary, merchant, and corporate customers.
 UP Payments Risk Management solution is a cloud-based, 360-degree approach to enterprise fraud management. The solution is designed to combat existing and emerging fraud threats using a combination of machine learning, fraud and payments data, advanced analytics, flexible rules and agile decision strategies. For banks and financial intermediaries, the ACI Proactive Risk Manager component gives customers real-time visibility into threats across their enterprise, including issuer card fraud, check/deposit fraud, wire fraud, merchant acquirer fraud, internal fraud and money laundering schemes at multiple perspectives, ranging from an account or customer level. For merchants, ReD Shield provides real-time fraud prevention for eCommerce and mCommerce transactions. 
Digital Channels 
 ACI offers banks advanced cash management capabilities in a multi-tenant, cloud-based platform.
 ACI Universal Online Banker is a comprehensive digital banking platform designed to meet the needs of small businesses up to large corporations. It enables banks to generate new revenues through an extensive library of APIs and payment services while delivering a compelling customer experience with a highly-intuitive user interface.

Bill Payments
 ACI meets the bill payment needs of corporate customers across numerous industries through a range of electronic bill payment solutions that help companies raise consumer satisfaction while reducing costs.
 UP Bill Payment solutions enable corporate customers to electronically present bills and collect payments from consumers through a single, integrated platform that powers the entire bill payments operation. The solution overcomes internal application silos, providing a seamless consumer experience across all payment channels, payment types and methods. Customers can use UP Bill Payment solutions to power one-time payments, recurring payments, service-fee payments, disbursement services, remittance services and eBilling. The solution also simplifies treasury management operations through a broad array of reconciliation, reporting and payment servicing tools. UP Bill Payment solutions include industry-leading security, full payment card industry (PCI) compliance and privacy practices. 
On Premises or On Demand Software Delivery Options 
 Our software solutions are offered to our customers through either a traditional term software license arrangement where the software is installed and operated on the customer premises (ACI On Premise) or through an on-demand arrangement where the solution is maintained and delivered through the cloud via our global data centers (ACI On Demand). Solutions delivered through ACIs On Demand cloud are available in either a single-tenant environment, known as a Software as a Service (SaaS) offering, or in a multi-tenant environment, known as a platform as a service (Platform) offering. Pricing and payment terms depend on which solutions the customer requires and their transaction volumes. Generally, customers are required to commit to a minimum contract of three to five years. 
Partnerships and Industry Participation 
 We have two major types of third-party product partners: technology partners, with whom we work closely along with industry leaders who drive key industry trends and mandates, and business partners, with whom we either embed technology in ACI products, host third-party software in ACIs cloud as a part of our ACI on Demand (AOD) offering, or jointly market solutions that include the products of other companies. 
 Technology partners help us add value to our solutions, stay abreast of current market conditions and industry developments such as standards. Technology partner organizations include Diebold, Inc. (Diebold), NCR Corporation (NCR), Wincor-Nixdorf, VISA, MasterCard, and SWIFT. In addition, ACI has membership in or participates in the relevant committees of a number of industry associations, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Interactive Financial eXchange Forum (IFX), International Payments Framework Association (IPFA), Banking Industry Architecture Network (BIAN), U.K. Cards Association, and the PCI Security Standards Council. These partnerships provide direction as it relates to the specifications that are used by the card schemes, and in some cases, manufacturers. These organizations typically look to ACI as a source of knowledge and experience to be shared in conjunction with creating and enhancing their standards. The benefit to ACI is in having the opportunity to influence these standards with concepts and ideas that will benefit ACI and ultimately our customers.

Business partner relationships extend our product portfolio, improve our ability to get our solutions to market and enhance our ability to deliver market-leading solutions. We share revenues with these business partners based on a number of factors related to overall value contribution in the delivery of the joint solution or payment type. The agreements with business partners include referral, resale, traditional original equipment manufacturer (OEM) relationships, and transaction fee based payment-enablement partnerships. These agreements generally grant ACI the right to create an integrated solution that we host or distribute, or provide ACI access to established payment networks or capabilities. The agreements are generally worldwide in scope and have a term of several years. 
 We have alliances with our technology partners HP, IBM, Microsoft Corporation, Red Hat, Inc., and Oracle USA, Inc. (Oracle), whose industry-leading hardware and software are utilized by ACIs products. These partnerships allow us to understand developments in the partners technology and to utilize their expertise in topics like scalability and performance testing.

ACI also provides further, more in-depth technical courses that allow students to use practical labs to enhance what they have learned in the classroom. The ACI trainers ability to understand customers systems means ACI can also provide tailored course materials for individual customers. Depending upon products purchased, training may be conducted at a dedicated education facility at one of ACIs offices, online, or at the customer site.

Research and Development 
 Our product development efforts focus on new products and improved versions of existing products. We facilitate user group meetings to help us determine our product strategy, development plans, and aspects of customer support. The user groups are generally organized geographically or by product lines. We believe that the timely development of new applications and enhancements is essential to maintain our competitive position in the market. 
 During the development of new products, we work closely with our customers and industry leaders to determine requirements. We work with device manufacturers, such as Diebold, NCR, and Wincor-Nixdorf, to ensure compatibility with the latest ATM technology. We work with network vendors, such as MasterCard, VISA, and SWIFT, to ensure compliance with new regulations or processing mandates. We work with computer hardware and software manufacturers, such as HP, IBM, Microsoft Corporation, and Oracle to ensure compatibility with new operating system releases and generations of hardware. Customers often provide additional information on requirements and serve as beta-test partners. 
 We have a continuous process to encourage and capture innovative product ideas. Such ideas include features as well as entire new products or service offerings. A Proof of Concept (POC) may be conducted in order to validate the idea. If determined to be viable, the innovation is scheduled into a Product Roadmap for development and release. 
 Our total research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $136.9 million, $169.9 million, and $145.9 million, or 13%, 17%, and 14%, of total revenues, respectively. 
 Customers 
 We provide software products and solutions to customers in a range of industries worldwide, with banks, financial intermediaries, and merchants comprising our largest industry segments. As of December 31, 2017, we serve over 5,100 customers, including 18 of the top 20 banks worldwide, as measured by asset size, and more than 300 of the leading merchants globally, as measured by revenue, in over 80 countries on six continents. Of this total, approximately 2,000 are in the ACI On Premise reportable segment and 3,100 are in the ACI On Demand reportable segment. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

ACIs distributors, resellers and system integration partners are enabled to provide supplemental or complete product implementation and customization services directly to our customers or in a co-prime delivery model.

 We distribute the products of other vendors where they complement our existing product lines. We are typically responsible for the sales and marketing of the vendors products, and agreements with these vendors generally provide for revenue sharing based on relative responsibilities. 
 Proprietary Rights and Licenses 
 We rely on a combination of trade secret and copyright laws, license agreements, contractual provisions, and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We distribute our software products under software license agreements that typically grant customers nonexclusive licenses to use our products. Use of our software products is usually restricted to designated computers, specified locations and/or specified capacity, and is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction or transfer of our software products. We also seek to protect the source code of our software as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work. Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of our software products and technology will not occur. 
 In addition to our own products, we distribute, or act as a sales agent for, software developed by third parties. However, we typically are not involved in the development process used by these third parties. Our rights to those third-party products and the associated intellectual property rights are limited by the terms of the contractual agreement between us and the respective third party. 
 Although we believe that our owned and licensed intellectual property rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us. Further, there can be no assurance that intellectual property protection will be available for our products in all foreign countries. 
 Like many companies in the electronic commerce and other high-tech industries, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights to business processes, technologies, and related standards that are relevant to us and our customers. These assertions have increased over time as a result of the general increase in patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. Third parties may also claim that the third-partys intellectual property rights are being infringed by our customers use of a business process method that utilizes products in conjunction

with other products, which could result in indemnification claims against us by our customers. Any claim against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product delivery delays, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or pay amounts in settlement, or require us to develop alternative non-infringing technology. We could also be required to defend or indemnify our customers against such claims. A successful claim by a third party of intellectual property infringement or one of our customers could compel us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements, pay significant damages or even stop selling certain products and incur additional costs to develop alternative non-infringing technology. 
 Government Regulation 
 Certain of our solutions are subject to federal, state, and foreign regulations and requirements. 
 Oversight by Banking Regulators. As a provider of payment services to banks and financial intermediaries, we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), an interagency body of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the National Credit Union Administration and various state regulatory authorities as part of the Multi-Region Data Processing Servicer Program (MDPS). The MDPS program includes technology suppliers who provide mission critical applications for a large number of financial institutions that are regulated by multiple regulatory agencies. Periodic information technology examination assessments are performed using FFIEC Interagency guidelines to identify potential risks that could adversely affect serviced financial institutions, determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations that affect the services provided to financial institutions and ensure the services we provide to financial institutions do not create systemic risk to the banking system or impact the safe and sound operation of the financial institutions we process. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our clients auditors and regulators. We are also subject to review under state and foreign laws and rules that regulate many of the same activities that are described above, including electronic data processing and back-office services for financial institutions and the use of consumer information. 
 Money Transfer. Official Payments Corporation, our EBPP affiliate, is registered as a Money Services Business. Accordingly, we are subject to the USA Patriot Act and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and U.S. Treasury Regulations. These businesses may also be subject to certain state and local licensing requirements. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, state attorneys general, and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and licensing. In addition, most states have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission to register as a money transmitter with that jurisdictions banking department. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations. ACI has also implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries, entities and individuals based on external threats to the U.S. foreign policy, national security, or economy; by other governments; or by global or regional multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations Security Council and the European Union as applicable. 
Segment Information and Foreign Operations 
 We derive a significant portion of our revenues from foreign operations. For detail of revenue by geographic region see Note 10, Segment Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 3,979 employees. 
 None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are good. 
 Available Information 
 Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), are available free of charge on our website at www.aciworldwide.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such information electronically with the SEC. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, Room 1580, NW, Washington DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
