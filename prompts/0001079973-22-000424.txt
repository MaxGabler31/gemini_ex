History and Development of the Company
 
We were incorporated in the State of Utah on October 4, 1985, under the name of Mormon Mint, Inc., and our business focused on the manufacture and marketing of commemorative medallions related to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. On January 5, 1999, the Company changed its name to Converge Global, Inc., and subsequently focused on the development and implementation of Internet web content and e-commerce applications. In the period from 2009 to 2014, we operated primarily in the mining exploration business, and in 2015, we left the mining business and began an internet-based marketing business focused on online marketing of service items to the hospitality and food service industry, selling retail product directly to consumers from food distributors via credit card and commercial accounts.
 
On September 4, 2015, Donald Steinberg and Charles Larsen acquired control of the Company through the purchase of 400,000,000 shares of restricted common stock and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Class A stock for $105,000.00, in equal amounts. On September 9, 2015, Donald Steinberg was appointed Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Company. Mr. Larsen was appointed to the Board of Directors. The new management changed the Company’s business plans and operations to focus on emerging opportunities in the cannabis and hemp industries. On December 1, 2015, the Company changed its name to Marijuana Company of America, Inc. and its stock trading symbol to MCOA. On December 6, 2019, a change of control occurred, where Donald Steinberg and Charles Larsen transferred their control shares to directors Robert Coale, Edward Manolos and Jesus Quintero. Also on December 6, 2019, Jesus Quintero, who was appointed as Chief Financial Officer in 2018, was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Quintero is currently our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and a member of the Board of Directors.

Growth Strategies and Strategic Priorities
 
Recent Acquisition
 
cDistro, Inc. 
 
On June 29, 2021, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of cDistro, Inc., a Florida-based hemp and CBD product distribution business incorporated in the State of Nevada (“cDistro”) by a statutory merger and share exchange. After the acquisition, cDistro’s founding partner and Chief Executive Officer, Ronald Russo, remains its Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer Jesus Quintero serves as cDistro’s Chief Financial Officer.
VBF Brands, Inc.
 
On October 6, 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Salinas Diversified Ventures, Inc., a California corporation, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, Management Services Agreement, Cooperation Agreement and Employment Agreement with VBF Brands, Inc., a California corporation (“VBF”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sunset Island Group, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“SIGO”). VBF and SIGO agreed to transfer to the Company all of VBF’s outstanding stock to the Company, and appointed our CEO and CFO Jesus Quintero as President of VBF.
 
VBF owns various fixed assets including machinery and equipment, a lease for a 10,000 square foot facility located at 20420 Spence Road, Salinas, California, 93908, leasehold improvements, good-will, inventory, tradenames including “VBF Brands,” trade secrets, intellectual property, and other tangible and intangible properties, including licenses issued by the City of Salinas, County of Monterey, and the State of California to operate a licensed cannabis nursery, cultivation facility, and operations for the manufacturing and distribution of cannabis and cannabis products.
 
VBF and SIGO agreed to sell and transfer to the Company all of VBF’s outstanding stock, and, by virtue of the Management Services Agreement, appoint Mr. Jesus Quintero as President of VBF, vesting management and control of VBF’s licensed cannabis operations in the Company. Concurrently, VBF and Livacich entered into a Cooperation Agreement, whereby VBF and Livacich agreed to cooperate to facilitate the transfer of ownership of VBF, which includes licenses issued by the City of Salinas, County of Monterey, and the State of California, to operate a cannabis nursery, cultivation facility and manufacturing and distribution operations to the Company. The Company also agreed to retain Livacich as Chief Executive Officer for a term of two years and agreed to compensate her with a salary including a signing cash bonus of $250,000, and a $250,000 performance cash bonus payable after six months after the Effective Date. The bonus is conditioned upon Livacich meeting an agreed to “Net Revenue” target of one million dollars ($1,000,000) from VBF’s operations during the six-month period after closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement, and her compliance with the terms and conditions of this Asset Purchase Agreement, the Management Services Agreement and the Cooperation Agreement.
 
As consideration for the transaction, the Company agreed to assume two secured convertible promissory notes issued by SIGO to St. George Investments, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“St. George”) (the “SIGO Notes”). The first note was issued December 8, 2017, in the original face amount of $170,000.00, and the second was issued February 13, 2018, in the original face amount of $4,245,000.00. SIGO also issued warrants to St. George to purchase shares in SIGO, and fifty (50) shares of Series A Preferred Stock in SIGO. St. George agreed to cancel the warrants and preferred shares upon the Company’s assumption of the SIGO Notes.
 
Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the closing is conditioned upon certain conditions precedent, specifically (i) VBF and SIGO’s full corporate authorization, consent and execution of this Agreement; (ii) VBF’s sale to MCOA of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of VBF; (iii) full corporate authorization, consent compliance with and execution of the Management Services Agreement and Cooperation Agreement; (iv) SIGO’s disclosure of the Agreement on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission; (v) full cooperation in MCOA’s financial auditing of VBF in accordance with ASC 805, including providing unrestricted access to all VBF corporate and financial records and providing all necessary cooperation with VBF financial personnel; (vi) full cooperation in aiding and assisting Buyer with its change of ownership applications with the relevant licensing authorities; (vii) the warranty of truthful representations and execution of and compliance with the terms and conditions of the Executive Employment Agreement, Management Services Agreement and the Cooperation Agreement.
 
As of the date of this filing, the conditions precedent to the closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement remain in the process of implementation, so that the Asset Purchase Agreement closing has not yet occurred pursuant to its terms. Legal counsel for MCOA is currently in the process of working with VBF, Salinas Diversified Ventures, and the relevant state and local governments to effect the change of control and license transfers necessary to close the Asset Purchase Agreement. The audit of VBF is also underway and the Company expects to finalize it soon.

Competition
 
Our competitors include sellers of hemp-based CBD products and professional services firms dedicated to the regulated hemp industry. We compete in markets where hemp has been legalized and regulated, which includes the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Our marketing efforts in Brazil and Uruguay are in the development stages. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the global industry matures. Additionally, increased competition worldwide is possible to the extent that new states, jurisdictions and countries enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes that de-criminalize and regulate hemp products, including the 2018 Farm Bill. We believe that by being well established in the industry, along with our experience, and our continued expansion of service and product offerings in new and existing locations, are factors that mitigate the risks associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our expected operations and results.
Joint Ventures and Investments
 
Our business also includes participating and making selected investments in other related businesses. The following disclosures include two parts. The first part discloses past joint ventures and investments that as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, were no longer effective and do not have a material current effect on the Company or its financial condition. These disclosures are provided to give a historical account of joint venture and investment activity over the past three to four years. The second part discloses active joint ventures and investments having a material effect on current operations and financial condition.

2. Current Joint Ventures  and Investments.
 

• | Global Hemp Group Joint Venture/Scio Oregon Hemp Project; On May 8, 2018, the Company, Global Hemp Group, Inc., a Canadian corporation, and TTO Enterprises, Ltd., an Oregon corporation entered into a Joint Venture Agreement. The purpose of the joint venture is to develop a project to commercialize the cultivation of industrial hemp on a 109 acre parcel of real property owned by the Company and Global Hemp Group in Scio, Oregon, and operating under the Oregon corporation Covered Bridges, Ltd. The joint venture agreement committed the Company to provide cash contributions of $600,000 payable on the following funding schedule: $200,000 upon execution of the joint venture agreement; $238,780 by July 31, 2018; $126,445 by October 31, 2018; and, $34,775 by January 31, 2019. The Company complied with its payments. The 2018 crop of hemp grown on the joint venture’s real property consisted of 33 acres of high yielding CBD hemp grown in an orchard style cultivation on the property. The 2018 harvest consisted of approximately 37,000 high yielding CBD hemp plants producing 24 tons of biomass that produced 48,000 pounds of dried biomass. The joint venture partners prepared processing samples ranging in size from 100 lbs. to 2,000 lbs. for sample offers to extraction companies. However, there were delays with Global Hemp Group’s management and maintenance of the business and the biomass that caused degradation to the harvested crop affecting marketability. Additional issues and disputes arose between the Company and Global Hemp Group. These disputes led to the parties entering into a settlement agreement on September 28, 2020, whereby Global Hemp Group agreed to pay the Company $200,000 and issue common stock to the Company equal in value to $185,000 as of September 28, 2020, subject to a non-dilutive protection provision. Additionally, Global Hemp Group agreed to pay the Company $10,000 to cover the Company’s legal fees relating to the Agreement. In exchange for the settlement consideration, the Company agreed to relinquish its ownership interest in the joint venture.

• | Bougainville Ventures, Inc. Joint Venture; On March 16, 2017, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Bougainville Ventures, Inc., a Canadian corporation. The purpose of the joint venture was for the Company and Bougainville to (i) jointly engage in the development and promotion of products in the legalized cannabis industry in Washington State; (ii) utilize Bougainville's high quality cannabis grow operations in the State of Washington, where it claimed to have an ownership interest in real property for use within the legalized cannabis industry; (iii) leverage Bougainville’s agreement with a I502 Tier 3 license holder to grow cannabis on the site; provide technical and management services and resources including, but not limited to: sales and marketing, agricultural procedures, operations, security and monitoring, processing and delivery, branding, capital resources and financial management; and, (iv) optimize collaborative business opportunities. The Company and Bougainville agreed to operate through a Washington State Limited Liability Company, and BV-MCOA Management, LLC was organized in the State of Washington on May 16, 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As our contribution to the joint venture, the Company committed to raise not less than $1,000,000 to fund joint venture operations, based upon a funding schedule. The Company also committed to providing branding and systems for the representation of cannabis related products and derivatives comprised of management, marketing and various proprietary methodologies directly tailored to the cannabis industry.
 The Company and Bougainville's agreement provided that funding by the Company would pay for the joint venture’s ultimate purchase of the land consisting of a one-acre parcel located in Okanogan County, Washington, for joint venture operations.
 
As disclosed on Form 8-K on December 11, 2017, the Company did not comply with the funding schedule for the joint venture. On November 6, 2017, the Company and Bougainville amended the joint venture agreement to reduce the amount of the Company's commitment from $1,000,000 to $800,000, and also required the Company to issue Bougainville 15 million shares of the Company's restricted common stock. The Company completed its payments pursuant to the amended agreement on November 7, 2017, and on November 9, 2017, issued to Bougainville 15 million shares of restricted common stock. The amended agreement provided that Bougainville would deed the real property to the joint venture within thirty days of its receipt of payment.

-

Thereafter, the Company determined that Bougainville had no ownership interest in the property in Washington State, but rather was a party to a purchase agreement for real property that was in breach of contract for non-payment. Bougainville also did not possess an agreement with a Tier 3 I502 license holder to grow Marijuana on the property. Nonetheless, as a result of funding arranged for by the Company, Bougainville and an unrelated third party, Green Ventures Capital Corp., purchased the land, but did not deed the real property to the joint venture. Bougainville failed to pay delinquent property taxes to Okanogan County and to date, the property has not been deeded to the joint venture.
 
To clarify the respective contributions and roles of the parties, the Company offered to enter into good faith negotiations to revise and restate the joint venture agreement with Bougainville. The Company diligently attempted to communicate with Bougainville to accomplish a revised and restated joint venture agreement, and efforts towards satisfying the conditions to complete the subdivision of the land by the Okanogan County Assessor. However, Bougainville failed to cooperate or communicate with the Company in good faith, and failed to pay the delinquent taxes on the real property that would allow for sub-division and the deeding of the real property to the joint venture.
 
On August 10, 2018, the Company advised its independent auditor that Bougainville did not cooperate or communicate with the Company regarding its requests for information concerning the audit of Bougainville’s receipt and expenditures of $800,000 contributed by the Company in the joint venture agreement. Bougainville had a material obligation to do so under the joint venture agreement. The Company believes that some of the funds it paid to Bougainville were misappropriated and that there was self-dealing with respect to those funds. Additionally, the Company believes that Bougainville misrepresented material facts in the joint venture agreement, as amended, including, but not limited to, Bougainville’s representations that: (i) it had an ownership interest in real property that was to be deeded to the joint venture; (ii) it had an agreement with a Tier 3 # I502 cannabis license holder to grow cannabis on the real property; and, (iii) that clear title to the real property associated with the Tier 3 # I502 license would be deeded to the joint venture thirty days after the Company made its final funding contribution. As a result, on September 20, 2018, the Company filed suit against Bougainville Ventures, Inc., BV-MCOA Management, LLC, Andy Jagpal, Richard Cindric, et al. in Okanogan County Washington Superior Court, case number 18-2- 0045324. The Company’s complaint seeks legal and equitable relief for breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, recession of the joint venture agreement, an accounting, quiet title to real property in the name of the Company, for the appointment of a receiver, the return to treasury of 15 million shares issued to Bougainville, and, for treble damages pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act in Washington State. The registrant has filed a lis pendens on the real property. The case is currently in litigation.
 
In connection with the agreement, the Company recorded a cash investment of $1,188,500 to the Joint Venture during 2017. This was comprised of 49.5% ownership of BV-MCOA Management LLC, and was accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company recorded an annual impairment in 2017 of $792,500, reflecting the Company’s percentage of ownership of the net book value of the investment. During 2018, the Company recorded equity losses of $37,673 and $11,043 for the first and second quarters respectively, and recorded an annual impairment of $285,986 for the year ended December 31, 2018, at which time the Company determined the investment to be fully impaired due to Bougainville’s breach of contract and resulting litigation, as discussed above.
 

• | Share Exchange with Cannabis Global, Inc. On September 30, 2020, the Company entered into a securities exchange agreement with Cannabis Global, Inc., a Nevada corporation. By virtue of the agreement, the Company issued 650,000,000 shares of its unregistered common stock to Cannabis Global in exchange for 7,222,222 shares of Cannabis Global unregistered common stock. The Company and Cannabis Global also entered into a lock up leak out agreement which prevents either party from sales of the exchanged shares for a period of 12 months. Thereafter the parties may sell not more than the quantity of shares equaling an aggregate maximum sale value of $20,000 per week, or $80,000 per month until all Shares and Exchange Shares are sold. This material transaction involves related parties, insofar as Edward Manolos, our director, is also a director of Cannabis Global, Inc.

• | Share Exchange with Eco Innovation Group, Inc. On February 26, 2021, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Eco Innovation Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation quoted on OTC Markets Pink (“ECOX”) to acquire the number of shares of ECOX’s common stock, equal in value to $650,000 based on the per-share price of $0.06, in exchange for the number of shares of MCOA common stock equal in value to $650,000 based on the closing price for the trading day immediately preceding the effective date (the “Share Exchange Agreement”). For both parties, the Share Exchange Agreement contains a “true-up” provision requiring the issuance of additional common stock in the event that a decline in the market value of either parties’ common stock should cause the aggregate value of the stock acquired pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement to fall below $650,000. Complementary to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company and ECOX entered into a Lock-Up Agreement dated February 26, 2021 (the “Lock-Up Agreement”), providing that the shares of common stock acquired pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement shall be subject to a lock-up period preventing its sale for a period of 12 months following issuance and limiting the subsequent sale to aggregate maximum sale value of $20,000 per week, or $80,000 per month. On October 1, 2021, we entered into a First Amendment to Lock-Up Agreement between the Company and Eco Innovation Group, Inc., dated and effective October 1, 2021 (the “Amended Lock-Up Agreement”), which amends that certain Lock-Up Agreement entered into between the Company and Eco Innovation Group, Inc. on February 26, 2021 (the “Original Lock-Up Agreement”). The Amended Lock-Up Agreement amends the Original Lock-Up Agreement in one respect, by amending the initial lock-up period from 12 months following its effective date to 6 months following its effective date. All other terms and conditions of the Original Lock-Up Agreement remain unaffected.

Government Regulation of Cannabis
 
Cannabis 
 
In the United States, the cultivation, manufacturing, importation, distribution, use and possession of cannabis containing a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis is illegal under U.S. federal law. However, medical and adult-use cannabis has been legalized and regulated by individual states. Currently, 37 states plus the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories recognize, in one form or another, the medical use of cannabis, while 18 of those states plus the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories recognize, in one form or another, the full adult use of cannabis. Notwithstanding the regulatory environment with respect to cannabis at the state level, cannabis continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA. Accordingly, the use, possession, or distribution of cannabis violates U.S. federal law. As a result, cannabis businesses in the United States are subject to inconsistent state and federal legislation, regulation and enforcement.
 
Under former President Barack Obama, in an effort to provide guidance to U.S. federal law enforcement regarding the inconsistent regulation of cannabis at the U.S. federal and state levels, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) released a memorandum on August 29, 2013 titled “Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement” from former Deputy Attorney General James Cole (the “Cole Memorandum”). The Cole Memorandum acknowledged that, although cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, the U.S. Attorneys in states that have legalized cannabis should prioritize the use of the U.S. federal government’s limited prosecutorial resources by focusing enforcement actions on the following eight areas of concern (the “Cole Priorities”):
 

• | Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In January 2018, under the administration of former President Donald Trump, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum. While this did not create a change in U.S. federal law, as the Cole Memorandum was policy guidance and not law, the rescission added to the uncertainty of U.S. federal enforcement of the CSA in states where cannabis use is legal and regulated. Former Attorney General Sessions, concurrent with the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, issued a memorandum (“Sessions Memorandum”) which explained that the Cole Memorandum was “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance adopted in the 1980s, as set forth in the U.S. Attorney’s Manual (“USAM”). The USAM enforcement priorities, like those of the Cole Memorandum, are also based on the U.S. federal government’s limited resources and include law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the alleged crimes, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.
 
While the Sessions Memorandum emphasizes that cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and states that it is a “dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime,” it does not otherwise provide that the prosecution of cannabis-related offenses is now a DOJ priority. Furthermore, the Sessions Memorandum explicitly indicates that it is a guide for prosecutorial discretion and that discretion is firmly in the hands of U.S. Attorneys who determine whether to prosecute cannabis-related offenses. U.S. Attorneys could individually continue to exercise their discretion in a manner similar to that permitted under the Cole Memorandum. While certain U.S. Attorneys have publicly affirmed their commitment to proceeding in a manner contemplated under the Cole Memorandum, or otherwise affirmed that their views of U.S. federal enforcement priorities have not changed as a result of the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, others have publicly supported the rescission of the Cole Memorandum.
 
Under former Attorney General William Barr, the Department of Justice did not take a formal position on the federal enforcement of laws relating to cannabis. However, prior to his resignation on December 23, 2020, former Attorney General William Barr stated that his preference would be to have a uniform federal rule against cannabis, but, absent such a uniform rule, his preference would be to permit the existing federal approach leaving it up to the states to make their own decision. In addition, former Attorney General William Barr indicated that the DOJ was reviewing the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act (“STATES Act”), which would shield individuals and businesses complying with state cannabis laws from federal intervention.
 
On March 10, 2021, the Senate confirmed, President Joseph R. Biden’s nominee, Merrick Garland, to serve as Attorney General in his administration. Furthermore, two of President Biden’s nominees for top positions at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) have strong track records of supporting and defending state-legalized marijuana programs. California’s former Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who serves as the head of HHS, vowed to defend California’s legal cannabis market from any potential intervention during the Trump administration. In addition, Pennsylvania’s former Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine, who serves as the Assistant Secretary of HHS, played a pivotal role in the implementation of Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana program. In addition, Democrats are generally more supportive of federal cannabis reform than Republicans. Currently, the Democrats compose a majority of the House of Representatives and have gained sufficient seats in the Senate to achieve control in the event of a Vice Presidential tie-breaking vote. Most notably, during the presidential campaign, President Biden stated that he supports decriminalizing marijuana. Despite the growing enthusiasm in the cannabis business community, it remains unclear whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy.
 
Other federal legislation provides or seeks to provide protection to individuals and businesses acting in violation of U.S. federal law but in compliance with state cannabis laws. For example, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has been included in annual spending bills passed by Congress since 2014. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment restricts the DOJ from using federal funds to interfere with states implementing laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical cannabis.
 
U.S. courts have construed these appropriations bills to prevent the U.S. federal government from prosecuting individuals or businesses engaged in cannabis-related activities to the extent they are operating in compliance with state medical cannabis laws. However, because this conduct continues to violate U.S. federal law, U.S. courts have observed that should the U.S. Congress choose to appropriate funds to prosecute individuals or businesses acting in violation of the CSA, such individuals or businesses could be prosecuted for violations of U.S. federal law even to the extent/even if they are operating in compliance with applicable state medical cannabis laws.
 

11
--

If Congress declines to include the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment in future fiscal year appropriations bills or fails to pass necessary budget legislation causing a government shutdown, the U.S. federal government will have the authority to spend federal funds to prosecute individuals and businesses acting contrary to the CSA for violations of U.S. federal law.
 
Furthermore, the appropriations protections only apply to individuals and businesses operating in compliance with a state’s medical cannabis laws and provide no protection to individuals or businesses operating in compliance with a state’s adult-use cannabis laws.
 
Additionally, there are a number of marijuana reform bills that have been introduced in the U.S. Congress that would amend federal law regarding the legal status and permissibility of medical and adult-use cannabis, including the STATES Act, the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (the “MORE Act”), the Substance Regulation and Safety Act (the “SRSA”) and the Medical Marijuana Research Act (the “MMRA”). The STATES Act would create an exemption in the CSA to allow states to determine their own cannabis policies without fear of federal reprisal.
 
The MORE Act, which was reintroduced to the House of Representatives on May 28, 2021, would remove cannabis from the CSA, expunge federal cannabis offenses and establish a 5% excise tax on cannabis to fund various federal grant programs. On March 1, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the MORE Act, a bill that would end the federal prohibition on cannabis by removing it from the list of banned controlled substances. This is the second time the bill passed the House; however, it is expected to receive opposition in the Senate and we have no clear expectation that the MORE Act will become law in the near future.
 
The SRSA, which was introduced by U.S. Senator Tina Smith on July 30, 2020, would remove cannabis from the CSA, grant the FDA authority to regulate cannabis and cannabis products and regulate the safety and quality control of cannabis crops and the import and export of cannabis materials. The MMRA, which was introduced in the House of Representatives on October 21, 2021, would amend the CSA to make marijuana accessible for use by qualified marijuana researchers for medical purposes. It is uncertain which federal marijuana reform bills, if any, will ultimately be passed and signed into law.
 
Businesses in the regulated cannabis industry, including our business, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States that involve money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the U.S. Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (“Bank Secrecy Act”) and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (the “US PATRIOT Act”) and the rules and regulations thereunder and any related or similar rules, regulations, or guidelines, issued, administered, or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States. Further, under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be charged with money laundering, aiding and abetting, or conspiracy.
 
Despite these laws, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”), issued a memorandum on February 14, 2014 (the “FinCEN Memorandum”), which provides instructions to banks and other financial institutions seeking to provide services to cannabis-related businesses. The FinCEN Memorandum explicitly references the Cole Priorities and indicates that in some circumstances it is permissible for banks and other financial institutions to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of U.S. federal money laundering laws. Under these guidelines, financial institutions are subject to a requirement to submit a suspicious activity report in certain circumstances as required by federal money laundering laws. These cannabis-related suspicious activity reports are divided into three categories: marijuana limited, marijuana priority and marijuana terminated, based on the financial institution’s belief that the marijuana business follows state law, is operating out of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated, respectively. The FinCEN Memorandum refers to supplementary guidance in the Cole Memorandum relating to the prosecution of money laundering offenses predicated on cannabis-related violations of the CSA.

The rescission of the Cole Memorandum did not affect the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, and to date, the U.S. Treasury has not given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum. While the FinCEN Memorandum was originally intended to work in tandem with the Cole Memorandum, the FinCEN Memorandum appears to remain in effect as standalone guidance. Although the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact, indicating that the U.S. Treasury and FinCEN intend to continue abiding by its guidance, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will continue to follow the guidelines set forth under the FinCEN Memorandum.
 
In March 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act (the “SAFE Banking Act”) which creates protections for financial institutions that provide banking services to businesses acting in compliance with applicable state cannabis laws. Most recently, on July 19, 2021, the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and Economic Strength Act of 2022 (the “America COMPETES Act of 2022”) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The America COMPETES Act of 2022 includes provisions of the SAFE Banking Act and sets out financial regulations for cannabis-related businesses and revises other aspects of the financial system with regard to cannabis-related businesses. On February 4, 2022, a majority of the U.S. House of Representatives passed the America COMPETES Act of 2022; however, it is uncertain whether it will be passed by the U.S. Senate and ultimately signed into law. This marks the sixth time that the U.S. House of Representatives have advanced SAFE Banking to the U.S. Senate. There can be no assurance that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. In addition, local and city ordinances may strictly limit and/or restrict the distribution of cannabis in a manner that could make it difficult or impossible to operate cannabis businesses in certain jurisdictions.
 
Hemp 
 
On December 20, 2018, the U.S. Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the “2018 Farm Bill”) was signed into law. Prior to its enactment, the U.S. federal government did not distinguish between cannabis and hemp and the entire plant species Cannabis sativa L. (subject to narrow exceptions applicable to specific portions of the plant) was scheduled as a controlled substance under the CSA. Therefore, the cultivation of hemp for any purpose in the United States without a Schedule I registration with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) was federally illegal, unless exempted by Section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the “2014 Farm Bill”). The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp (which is defined as “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis”) and its derivatives, extracts and cannabinoids, including CBD derived from hemp, from the definition of marijuana in the CSA, thereby removing hemp and its derivatives from DEA purview as a controlled substance. The 2018 Farm Bill also amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to allow for the commercial production of hemp in the United States under the purview of the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) in coordination with state departments of agriculture that elect to have primary regulatory authority over hemp production in their respective jurisdictions. Pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill, states, U.S. territories and tribal governments may adopt their own regulatory plans for hemp production even if more restrictive than federal regulations so long as they meet minimum federal standards and are approved by the USDA. Hemp production in states and tribal territories that do not choose to submit their own plans and that do not prohibit hemp production will be governed by USDA regulation.
 
On October 31, 2019, the USDA issued an interim final rule governing the domestic production of hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill, establishing the U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program (the “USDA IFR”). The USDA IFR outlines the requirements for the USDA to approve plans submitted by states and tribal governments for the domestic production of hemp. It also establishes a federal plan for hemp producers in states or territories of Native American tribes that do not have USDA-approved hemp production plans. Pursuant to the USDA IFR, the USDA reviews hemp production plans submitted by state and tribal governments that wish to obtain or retain primary regulatory authority over hemp production in their respective jurisdictions. Once the USDA formally receives a plan from a state or tribal government, the agency has 60 days to review and approve or reject the plan.
 

13
--

Although the USDA IFR provides the framework for the USDA, state departments of agriculture and tribal governments to begin the implementation of commercial hemp production programs pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill, the 2014 Farm Bill was scheduled to remain in effect for one year after the effective date of the USDA IFR. On January 15, 2021, the USDA issued a final rule on hemp production which incorporates modifications established under the USDA IFR published in October 2019. The rule became effective on March 22, 2021 and outlines, among other things, the licensing requirements, recordkeeping requirements, procedures for testing THC concentrations and, procedures for disposing of non-compliant plants.
 
The application of the hemp provisions of the 2014 Farm Bill was initially set to expire on October 31, 2020, at which time state programs would be required to comply with the 2018 Farm Bill regulations. However, U.S. Senators and state agricultural departments requested an extension of the application of the 2014 Farm Bill and a delay of the implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill due to delays caused by COVID-19. Although, as a result of the extension, the 2014 Farm Bill was set to expire on December 31, 2021, it was extended until January 1, 2022, by the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2021. As of January 1, 2022, there have been no further extensions and all states must either have a USDA-approved hemp product plan, or grant regulatory oversight over hemp cultivation to the USDA.
 
Under the 2018 Farm Bill, states and tribal governments have authority to adopt regulatory regimes that are more restrictive than federal mandates or prohibit hemp production altogether. Accordingly, variance in hemp regulation across jurisdictions is likely to persist. Compliance with state hemp law, if any, is required under the 2018 Farm Bill.
 As a result of the 2018 Farm Bill, federal law now provides that CBD derived from hemp is not a controlled substance under the CSA; however, CBD derived from hemp could still be considered a controlled substance under applicable state law. States take varying approaches to regulating the production and sale of hemp and hemp-derived CBD. While some states explicitly authorize and regulate the production and sale of CBD or otherwise provide legal protection for authorized individuals and businesses to engage in commercial hemp activities, other states maintain outdated drug laws that do not distinguish hemp or hemp-derived CBD from marijuana (or “cannabis” as used herein), resulting in hemp being classified as a controlled substance under certain state laws. In these states, the sale of CBD, notwithstanding its origin, is either restricted to state medical or adult-use cannabis program licensees or remains unlawful. Additionally, a number of states prohibit the sale of consumable CBD products based on the position of the FDA set forth in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FFDCA”) that it is unlawful to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as or in dietary supplements regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived.
 
The 2018 Farm Bill preserves the authority and jurisdiction of the FDA under the FFDCA to regulate the manufacture, marketing and sale of food, drugs, dietary supplements and cosmetics, including products that contain hemp extracts and derivatives such as CBD. As a producer and marketer of hemp-derived products, we are required to comply with FDA regulations applicable to the manufacturing and marketing of such products, including with respect to dietary supplements, food and cosmetics. To date, the FDA has not deemed CBD or other cannabinoids permissible for use in dietary supplements, as dietary ingredients, or as safe for use in food. The FDA has consistently taken the position that CBD is prohibited from being marketed as a dietary supplement or added to food because substantial clinical trials studying CBD as a new drug must be made public prior to the marketing of any food or dietary supplements containing CBD.
 
The FDA has issued warning letters to companies unlawfully marketing CBD products. In many of these cases, the manufacturer made unsubstantiated claims that products containing CBD are able to treat serious medical conditions, including cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, opioid withdrawal and anxiety, among others, without obtaining drug approvals. Some of these letters were co-signed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and cited the companies for making claims about the efficacy of CBD that were not substantiated by scientific evidence.
 
The FDA has stated that it recognizes the potential opportunities and significant interest in drugs and consumer products containing CBD, is committed to evaluating the agency’s regulatory policies related to CBD and has established a high-level internal working group to explore potential pathways for various types of CBD products to be lawfully marketed. The FDA has authority to issue regulation that would allow these naturally-occurring hemp compounds to be added to food or dietary supplements. In May 2019, the FDA held a public hearing to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than Epidiolex (cannabidiol), a cannabis-derived product, and three synthetic cannabis-related drug products (Marinol (dronabinol), Syndros (dronabinol) and Cesamet (nabilone)), the FDA has not approved a marketing application for cannabis for the treatment of any disease or condition and has not approved any cannabis, cannabis-derived or CBD products. See Risk Factors—Our products are not approved by the FDA or any other federal governmental authority; and There is uncertainty surrounding the regulatory pathway for CBD.
 
In connection with the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, the House Committee on Appropriations issued an explanatory statement agreeing to appropriate $2.0 million in funding to the FDA for research, policy evaluation, market surveillance and issuance of an enforcement discretion policy for products under the FDA’s jurisdiction that contain CBD. The legislation required the FDA to provide a report within 60 days regarding its progress in obtaining and analyzing data to help determine a policy of enforcement discretion and the process through which CBD will be evaluated for use in products. On March 5, 2020, the FDA issued a report on its progress and committed to expanding its educational efforts regarding CBD products, encouraging, facilitating and initiating more research on CBD, continuing to monitor the CBD marketplace and take appropriate action against unlawful CBD products that pose a risk of harm to the public and developing a risk-based enforcement policy aimed at protecting the public and providing more regulatory clarity regarding the FDA’s CBD enforcement priorities. The FDA was also required to conduct a sampling study of the current CBD marketplace to determine the extent to which products containing CBD are mislabeled or adulterated within 180 days of the enactment of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020.
 
On July 9, 2020, the FDA issued its sampling study to the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations and the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations detailing the sampling conducted in recent years on CBD products. While the minority of CBD products previously tested by the FDA contained CBD concentrations consistent with their labeling, the report states that a majority of products tested for potentially harmful elements “did not raise significant public health concerns.” The report further provides that the FDA will undertake a more extensive sampling effort expected to cover a representative sample of currently marketed CBD products, including tinctures, oils, extracts, capsules, powders, gummies, water and other beverages, conventional foods, cosmetics, lubricants, tampons, suppositories, vape cartridges and products sold for consumption by pets. Products will be evaluated for cannabinoid content as well as potentially harmful elements.
 
The rules, regulations and enforcement in this area continue to evolve and develop. On August 20, 2020, the DEA issued an interim final rule conforming its regulations to the 2018 Farm Bill (the “DEA IFR”), which went into effect on August 21, 2020. Notably, the DEA IFR creates uncertainty with respect to the federal legal status of any hemp derivative, extract, or product that exceeds a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of 0.3 percent during processing, which, pursuant to the DEA IFR, renders it a federal Schedule I substance under the CSA even if the hemp plant from which any such material is sourced does not exceed the 0.3 percent threshold.
 
On September 4, 2020, the Hemp and Hemp-Derived CBD Consumer Protection and Market Stabilization Act of 2020 was initially introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and was reintroduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on February 4, 2021. The Hemp and Hemp-Derived CBD Consumer Protection and Market Stabilization Act of 2020 permits the inclusion of hemp and CBD derived from hemp as ingredients in dietary supplements that otherwise comply with the applicable requirements for dietary supplements set forth in the FFDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. The bill does not address the inclusion of hemp or CBD derived from hemp as ingredients in food products, and it is unclear whether it will ultimately be passed and signed into law.
 
On January 8, 2021, the FDA issued a report stating that more real-world data on CBD use and safety, alongside data from other types of studies, is needed to fill in the current gaps in the FDA’s understanding of the safety profile of CBD and many other cannabis-derived compounds, including potential safety risks for people and animals. Until these gaps are filled and the FDA formally adopts regulations authorizing the production and sale of CBD products as food and/or dietary supplements, there is a risk that the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Failure to comply with FDA requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, seizures, fines and criminal prosecutions. We continue to closely monitor FDA developments with respect to CBD and our compliance with applicable United States laws relating to hemp, including the FDA’s regulations of CBD and evaluate and implement appropriate compliance measures on an ongoing basis.
 
On February 8, 2022, the Hemp Advancement Act of 2022 was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Hemp Advancement Act of 2022 would raise the permitted THC threshold for hemp and in-process hemp extract, remove the requirement that hemp testing occur at DEA-registered facilities, and allow people with drug-related felony convictions to receive a hemp license.

Application of Cannabis Regulations in the United States 
 
Violations of U.S. federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions, or settlements arising from either civil or criminal proceedings brought by either the U.S. federal government or private citizens, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, seizure of property or products, cessation of business activities, or divestiture. Our cannabis business activities and the cannabis business activities of our subsidiaries, while believed to be compliant with applicable U.S. state and local laws, currently are illegal under U.S. federal law.
Cannabis Regulations in Brazil
 
Brazilian law currently prohibits cannabis cultivation, processing, and sales. This restriction applies to both marijuana and industrial hemp. There is no distinction between hemp and marijuana. As a result, there is no specific legislation on industrial hemp. However, on August 18, 2020, draft legislation was introduced that would allow Brazilian farmers to grow cannabis for medical and industrial purposes on domestic soil for the first time has been submitted to the country’s lower house of Congress. The bill was delivered to the House of Deputies speaker by lawmakers Paulo Teixeira and Luciano Ducci, co-sponsors of the bill who sit on the chamber’s special commission for the regulation of medicinal cannabis. Action is pending on this legislation.
Cannabis Regulations in Uruguay
 
Cannabis is legal in Uruguay, and is one of the most widely used drugs in the nation. President Jose Mujica signed legislation to legalize recreational cannabis in December 2013, making Uruguay the first country in the modern era to legalize cannabis. Uruguay has an established market that the Company intends to enter and compete in.
