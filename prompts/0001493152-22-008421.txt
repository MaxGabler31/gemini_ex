Introduction
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read together and in connection with the other reports that have been filed by us with the SEC for a comprehensive description of our financial condition and operating results. In the interest of disclosure, we have included in this Form 10-K certain material events and developments that have taken place through the date of filing of this Form 10-K with the SEC.
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, INVO Bioscience, Inc. (INVO Bioscience, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referred to in this document as “we”, “us”, “INVO Bioscience”, “INVO,” or the “Company”), incorporates by reference certain information from parts of other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The SEC allows us to disclose important information by referring to it in that manner. Please refer to all such information when reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All information is as of December 31, 2021, unless otherwise indicated. For a description of the risk factors affecting or applicable to our business, see “Risk Factors,” below.


The Company
 
We are a commercial-stage fertility company dedicated to expanding the assisted reproductive technology (“ART”) marketplace by making fertility care accessible and inclusive to people around the world. Our flagship product is INVOcell, a revolutionary medical device that allows fertilization and early embryo development to take place in vivo within the woman’s body. Our primary mission is to implement new medical technologies aimed at increasing the availability of affordable, high-quality, patient-centered fertility care. This treatment solution is the world’s first intravaginal culture technique for the incubation of oocytes and sperm during fertilization and early embryo development. This technique, designated as “IVC”, provides patients a more natural, intimate and more affordable experience in comparison to other ART treatments. The IVC procedure can deliver comparable results at a lower cost than traditional in vitro fertilization (“IVF”) and is a significantly more effective treatment than intrauterine insemination (“IUI”). Our commercialization strategy is focused on the opening of dedicated “INVO Centers” offering the INVOcell and IVC procedure (with three centers in North America now operational), in addition to continuing to sell our technology solution into existing fertility clinics.


We were formed on January 5, 2007, under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts under the name Bio X Cell, Inc. to acquire the assets of Medelle Corporation (“Medelle”). Dr. Claude Ranoux purchased and contributed all of the assets of Medelle, including four patents relating to the INVOcell technology, to Bio X Cell, Inc. upon its formation in January 2007.


On December 5, 2008, Bio X Cell, Inc., doing business as INVO Bioscience, and each of the shareholders of INVO Bioscience entered into a share exchange agreement and consummated a share exchange with Emy’s Salsa AJI Distribution Company, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Emy’s”). Upon the closing of the share exchange on December 5, 2008, the INVO Bioscience shareholders transferred all of their shares of common stock in INVO Bioscience to Emy’s. In connection with the share exchange, Emy’s changed its name to INVO Bioscience, Inc. and Bio X Cell, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Emy’s (re-named INVO Bioscience, Inc.).
 
Recent Developments
 
In January 2022, we issued 94,623 shares of common stock to Paradigm Opportunities Fund, LP (“Paradigm”). The shares were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We received $315,000 in proceeds from this issuance. Pursuant to its terms, on March 30, 2022, we terminated the stock purchase agreement with Paradigm, under which Paradigm had committed to purchase 600,703 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,999,740.29. We issued our termination notice when it became clear that Paradigm would not be able to fulfil its commitment in a timely fashion.
 
On March 29, 2022, the joint venture agreement between INVO and Medesole Healthcare and Trading Private Limited, India was terminated by us pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement after mutual agreement with Medesole that Medesole would not be able to fulfil its commitments in a timely fashion.
 
Operations 
 
We operate with a core internal team and outsource certain operational functions in order to help accelerate our efforts as well as reduce internal fixed overhead needs and in-house capital equipment requirements. Our most critical management and leadership functions are carried out by our core management team. We have contracted out the manufacturing, packaging/labeling and sterilization of the device to a contract medical manufacturing company that completes final product manufacturing as well as manages the gamma sterilization process at a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) registered contract sterilization facility.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had ten full time and two part time employees. We also engage key consultants to further support our operations.


Market Opportunity
 
The global ART marketplace is a large, multi-billion industry growing at a strong pace in many parts of the world as increased infertility rates, increased patient awareness, acceptance of treatment options, and improving financial incentives such as insurance and governmental assistance continue to drive demand. According to the European Society for Human Reproduction 2020 ART Fact Sheet, one in six couples worldwide experience infertility problems. Additionally, the worldwide market remains vastly underserved as a high percentage of patients in need of care continue to go untreated each year for many reasons, but key among them are capacity constraints and cost barriers. While there have been large increases in the use of IVF, there are still only approximately 2.6 million ART cycles, including IVF, IUI and other fertility treatments, performed globally each year, producing around 500,000 babies. This amounts to less than 3% of the infertile couples worldwide being treated and only 1% having a child though IVF. The industry remains capacity constrained which creates challenges in providing access to care to the volume of patients in need. A survey by “Resolve: The National Infertility Association,” indicates the two main reasons couples do not use IVF is cost and geographical availability (and/or capacity).


In the United States, infertility, according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (2017), affects an estimated 10%-15% of the couples of childbearing-age. According to the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”), there are approximately 6.7 million women with impaired fertility. Based on preliminary 2020 data from the CDC’s National ART Surveillance System, approximately 326,000 IVF cycles were performed at 449 IVF centers, leaving the U.S. with a large, underserved patient population, which is similar to most markets around the world.


Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that the INVOcell, and the IVC procedure it enables, have the following key advantages:


Lower cost than IVF with equivalent efficacy. The IVC procedure can be offered for less than IVF due to lower cost of supplies, labor, capital equipment and general overhead. The laboratory equipment needed to perform an IVF cycle is expensive and requires ongoing costs as compared to what is required for an IVC cycle. As a result, we also believe INVOcell and the IVC procedure enable a clinic and its laboratory to be more efficient as compared to conventional IVF.
 
The IVC procedure is currently being offered at practicing clinics at a range of $5,000 - $11,000 per cycle and from $4,500 to $7,000 at the existing INVO Centers, thereby making it more affordable than conventional IVF (which tends to average $12,000 to $17,000 per cycle or higher).

Improved efficiency providing for greater capacity and improved access to care and geographic availability. In many parts of the world, including the U.S., IVF clinics tend to be concentrated in higher population centers and are often capacity constrained in terms of how many patients a center can treat, with volume often limited by the number of capital-intensive incubators available in IVF clinic labs. With the significant number of untreated patients along with the growing interest and demand for services, the industry remains challenged to provide sufficient access to care and to do so at an economical price. We believe INVOcell, and the IVC procedure it enables, can play a significant role in helping to address these challenges. According to the 2020 CDC Report, there are approximately 449 IVF centers in the U.S. We estimate that by adopting the INVOcell, IVF clinics can increase fertility cycle volume by up to 30% without adding to personnel, space and/or equipment costs. Our own INVO Centers also address capacity constraints by adding to the overall ART cycle capacity and doing so with comparable efficacy to IVF outcomes as well as at a lower per cycle price. Moreover, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to drive more significant growth in fertility treatment capacity in the future by partnering with existing OB/GYN practices. In the U.S., there are an estimated 5,000 OB/GYN offices, many of which offer fertility services (usually limited to consultation and IUI, but not IVF). Since the IVC procedure requires a much smaller lab facility, less equipment, and fewer lab personnel (in comparison to conventional IVF), it could potentially be offered as an extended service in an OB/GYN office. With proper training and a lighter lab infrastructure, the INVOcell could expand the business for these physicians and allow them to treat patients that are unable to afford IVF and provide patients with a more readily accessible, convenient, and cost-effective solution. With our three-pronged strategy (IVF clinics, INVO Centers and OB/GYN practices), in addition to lowering costs, we believe INVOcell and the IVC procedure can address our industry’s key challenges, capacity and cost, by their ability to expand and decentralize treatment and increase the number of points of care for patients in need. This powerful combination of lower cost and added capacity has the potential to dramatically open up access to care for patients around the world.


Greater patient involvement. With the IVC procedure, the patient uses their own body for fertilization, incubation and early embryo development which creates a greater sense of involvement, comfort and participation. In some cases, this may also free people from barriers related to ethical or religious concerns, or fears of laboratory mix-ups.


Sales and Marketing
 
Our product commercialization efforts are focused on identifying distributors and partners within targeted geographic regions that we believe can best promote, market, and sell the INVOcell and support our efforts to expand access to advanced fertility treatment for the large number of underserved infertile people hoping to have a baby. We believe that the IVC procedure is an effective and affordable treatment option that greatly reduces the need for more expensive IVF lab facilities and allows providers to pass on related savings to patients without compromising efficacy. We have been cleared to sell the INVOcell in the United States since November 2015 after receiving de novo class II clearance from the FDA. Our primary focus has been on establishing INVO Centers to promote the INVOcell and the IVC procedure, selling the INVOcell directly to U.S. fertility clinics, and developing key international market partnerships around the world.


We anticipate that we will experience quarterly fluctuations in our revenue as we expand the sales of the INVOcell to new markets in the U.S. and globally. We continue to seek partners that will contractually commit to meeting agreeable performance objectives that are consistent with our goals and objectives.
 
Ferring
 
On November 12, 2018, we entered into a U.S. Distribution Agreement (the “Ferring Agreement”) with Ferring International Center S.A. (“Ferring”), which closed on January 14, 2019. Pursuant to the Ferring Agreement, among other things, we granted Ferring an exclusive license in the United States to market, promote, distribute, and sell the INVOcell. Ferring was responsible, at its own cost, for all commercialization activities for in the United States. We retained a limited exception to the exclusive license granted to Ferring allowing us, subject to certain restrictions, to establish up to five INVO Centers in the United States, which as of March 2, 2021, was amended to seven centers. We retained all commercialization rights for the INVOcell outside of the United States.
 
On November 2, 2021, Ferring notified us of its intention to terminate the Ferring Agreement, which required 90-days prior written notice. Accordingly, the Ferring Agreement officially terminated on January 31, 2022. Pursuant to the terms of the Ferring Agreement, upon notice of termination, Ferring was required to use commercially reasonable efforts to transition any customers to us and otherwise facilitate the orderly transition of the distribution from Ferring to us. By its terms, our Supply Agreement with Ferring also terminated on January 31, 2022.
 
The Ferring license was deemed to be a functional license that provides the counterparty with a “right to access” to our intellectual property during the subscription period and accordingly, revenue is recognized over a period of time, which is generally the subscription period. During the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, we recognized $3.6 million and $0.7 million of revenue related to the Ferring license agreement, respectively.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had no deferred revenue related to the Ferring Agreement as it was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 in relation to the contract termination. The likelihood of Ferring exercising its rights became remote at the time notice of termination was received therefore INVO recognized the full remaining amount of the deferred revenue.


International Distribution Agreements
 
We have entered into exclusive distribution agreements for a number of international markets. These agreements usually have an initial term with renewal options and require the distributors to meet minimum annual purchases, which vary depending on the market. We are also required to register the product in each market before the distributor can begin importing, a process and timeline that can vary widely depending on the market.
 
The following table sets forth a list of our current international distribution agreements:

Pursuant to the Lyfe Agreement, we will provide embryology laboratory services in connection with the IVC procedure and other fertility-related treatments (the “Lab Services”) to be provided by Lyfe to its patients at the Bay Area Clinic. Under the terms of the Lyfe Agreement, we will receive 40% of the net income received by the Bay Area Clinic for the performance of the Lab Services. As of December 31, 2021, the Bay Area Clinic was not yet operational.
Competition
 
The fertility treatment regimens that the INVOcell and IVC procedure compete with when infertile people, in conjunction with their physician, are choosing the treatment method include drug-only stimulation, IUI, and conventional IVF. The fertility industry is highly competitive and characterized by long-standing well-entrenched procedures as well as technological improvements. Our INVOcell enables the first new advanced treatment alternative in over forty years. We face competition from all ART practitioners and device manufacturers. To date, most advancements in the ART market have been limited to incremental improvements to the various products designed to simply support conventional IVF.


Our principal ART medical device competitor for INVOcell is an intrauterine device called AneVivo™, developed by Anecova, a Swiss life sciences company. The principal difference between the INVOcell and AneVivo™ is its placement inside the woman’s uterus for early embryo development. We believe that placing the device in the uterus may be more invasive and thus may increase the risk to patients compared to the INVOcell, which is placed in the vaginal cavity. Currently, AneVivo™ has obtained a CE Mark, but has not received FDA approval.
 
For additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Government Regulation
 
In November 2015, FDA granted our petition for de novo classification of the INVOcell. The INVOcell is intended for use in preparing, holding, and transferring human gametes or embryos during IVC procedure with or without intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection fertilization (“ICSI”). The special controls include clinical and non-clinical performance testing, biocompatibility, sterility and shelf-life testing, and labeling. These special controls also apply to competing products that seek 510(k) clearance under the classification regulation for IVC systems, including our own 510(k) effort to expand the labeling on INVOcell from a 3-day incubation period to up to a 5-day incubation period.
 
We are subject to regulation in each of the foreign countries where our products are sold. Many of the regulations applicable to our products in such countries are similar to those of the FDA. The national health or regulatory organizations of certain countries require that our products be qualified before they can be marketed in those countries. Many of the countries we are targeting either do not have a formal approval process of their own or will rely on either FDA clearance or the European approval, the CE mark – although many of these countries do require specific registration processes in order to list the INVOcell and make it available for sale.
 
With our CE marking, we have the necessary regulatory authority to distribute our product, after registration, in the European Economic Area (i.e., Europe, Australia, and New Zealand). In addition, we will have the ability to market in various parts of the Middle East, Asia and South America. Every country has different regulatory and registration requirements, and we have begun or completed registrations in a number of countries. In general, we are registering the product based on the size of the market and our ability to service it given our resources as well as based on interest received from, and the execution of, agreements with distribution and joint venture partners.
 
We may be subject to healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments in the states and foreign countries in which we might conduct our business. The federal laws and many state laws generally apply only to entities or individuals that provide items or services for which payment may be made under a government healthcare program. These include laws that prohibit:
 

● | the payment or receipt of anything of value in exchange for referrals of business (e.g. Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b) (the “AKS”); Civil Monetary Penalties Law (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a) (the “CMPL”); Ala. Code § 22-1-11(c)); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the presenting of a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a government healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid (e.g. False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 – 3733); Georgia State False Medicaid Claims Act (Ga. Code Ann. §§ 49-4-168 – 49-4-168.6)); and 
● | the referral by certain ordering licensed healthcare providers of certain healthcare items and services that are payable by a government healthcare program to an entity in which the healthcare provider or his or her immediate family member has an investment or other financial relationship (e.g. Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1395nn), commonly referred to as the “Stark Law”; Georgia Patient Self-Referral Act of 1993 (Ga. Code Ann. §§ 43-1B-1 – 43-1B-8)). 

 
These laws are subject to extensive and increasing enforcement by numerous federal, state, and local government agencies including the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and various state authorities. At present, the Company’s products and services are not reimbursable under any government healthcare program. If, however, that changes in the future and it were determined that the Company was not in compliance with these federal fraud, waste, and abuse laws, the Company would be subject to liability.
 
We are subject to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH Act”), and related implementing regulations (together, “HIPAA”). Under HIPAA, the Company must have in place administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. In the ordinary course of our business as a Business Associate, and soon with INVO Centers, as a Covered Entity, we may use, collect, and store sensitive data, including protected health information (“PHI”). We face risks relative to protecting this critical information, including loss of access risk, inappropriate disclosure risk, inappropriate modification risk, and the risk of being unable to adequately monitor our controls. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Failure to comply with HIPAA, including through a breach of PHI, could result in penalties and sanctions, and materially harm our business.
 
For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Risk Factors in Item 1A.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, and trademark laws in the United States and other countries to obtain and maintain our intellectual property. We protect our intellectual property by, among other methods, filing patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and its foreign counterparts on inventions that are important to the development of our business.
 
Our product development process has resulted in the development of one (1) patent currently live and in good standing covering the INVOcell device, which is set to expire on July 14, 2024 (US Pat. No. 7,759,115). We completed a redesign of the INVOcell device as well as process improvements on the IVC procedure, which supported a new patent application that was filed on November 11, 2020 and is currently pending. We also filed a PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) application for the new U.S. application on January 18, 2021 to further expand patent protection in strategic locations across the globe.
 
Our portfolio of U.S. registered trademarks includes:
 
● Registration Nos. 6146631 and 3757982 for INVOCELL
 ● Registration No. 4009827 for INVO
 ● Registration No. 4009828 for INVO BIOSCIENCE
 
We also have pending U.S. applications to register the trademarks INVO CENTER (App. No. 88564596), and Life Begins Within (App. No. 90803801).
