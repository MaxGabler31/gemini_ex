Item 1. Business
 
The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that develops, owns and operates, or licenses upscale, high-energy restaurants and lounges and provides turn-key food and beverage services for hospitality venues including hotels, casinos and other high-end locations globally. We define turn-key food and beverage (“F&B”) services as those services that can be scaled and implemented by us at a particular hospitality venue and customized per the requirements of the client. We became The One Group Hospitality, Inc. through a reverse merger completed in October 2013. Our stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol “STKS”.
 
We were established with the vision of becoming a global market leader in the hospitality industry by melding high-quality service, ambiance and cuisine into one great experience. Our primary restaurant brand is STK, a multi-unit steakhouse concept that combines a high-energy, social atmosphere with the quality and service of a traditional upscale steakhouse. Our F&B hospitality management services include developing, managing and operating restaurants, bars, rooftop lounges, pools, banqueting and catering facilities, private dining rooms, room service and mini bars tailored to the specific needs of high-end hotels and casinos. Our F&B hospitality clients operate global hospitality brands such as the W Hotel, Cosmopolitan Hotel, Royalton, Hippodrome Casino, Hyatt and ME Hotels.
 
We opened our first restaurant in January 2004 in New York City and as of December 31, 2017, we owned, operated, or managed or licensed 31 venues including 14 STKs in major metropolitan cities in the United States, Europe and Middle East. In addition, we provided food and beverage services in five hotels and casinos. We generate management and incentive fee revenue from those restaurants and lounges that we do not own, but instead manage on behalf of our F&B hospitality clients. All our restaurants, lounges and F&B services are designed to create a social dining and high-energy entertainment experience within a destination location. We believe that this design and operating philosophy separates us from more traditional restaurant and foodservice competitors.

We expect to continue to expand our operations domestically and internationally through a mix of licensed restaurants and managed units using a disciplined and targeted site selection process (“capital light strategy”). We currently anticipate that our expansion plans will require capital expenditures, net of improvement allowances, of $1.0 million to $2.0 million over the next 12 months. There can be no assurance that we will be able to expand our operations at the rate we currently expect, or at all.
 
STK
 
STK is a global steakhouse restaurant concept with locations in major metropolitan cities. STK artfully blends the modern steakhouse and a chic lounge, offering a high-energy, fine dining experience in a social atmosphere with the quality and service of a traditional upscale steakhouse. Each STK location features a large, open restaurant and bar area with a DJ playing music throughout the restaurant, offering our customers a high-energy, fun “destination” environment that encourages social interaction. We believe this concept truly differentiates us from other upscale steakhouses. Our menu provides a variety of portion sizes and signature options to appeal to a broad customer demographic. We currently operate eight owned, four managed and two licensed STK restaurants in major metropolitan cities, such as Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Ibiza, Las Vegas, London, Los Angeles, Miami, Milan, New York and Orlando. We expect to open an STK restaurant in the Andaz Hotel in San Diego, California in the second quarter of 2018.
 
Our growth in 2018 is expected to continue with the planned opening of licensed locations in Puerto Rico, Dubai, Qatar and Mexico. We had plans to open company-owned restaurants in Austin and Dallas, TX, but have determined that opening these locations is not in line with our capital light strategy. Accordingly, we wrote off assets of $0.6 million in 2017 related to these locations.
 
Our STK restaurants average approximately 10,000 square feet and we typically target locations that range in size from 8,000 to 10,000 square feet. In 2017, the average unit volume, check average and beverage mix for owned and managed STK restaurants that have been open 18 months at December 31, 2017 were $10.8 million, $110.39 and 37%, respectively.
 
We are focused on expanding our global footprint. We believe that the locations of our restaurants are critical to our long-term success, and we devote significant time and resources to analyzing each prospective site. We intend to continue our focus on (i) metropolitan areas with demographic and discretionary spending profiles that favor our high-end concepts and (ii) finding partners with excellent track records and brand recognition. We also consider factors such as traffic patterns, proximity to high-end shopping areas and office buildings, hotels and convention centers, area restaurant competition, accessibility and visibility. We have identified over 30 additional major metropolitan areas across the globe where we could grow our STK brand over the next several years. We expect to open as many as three to five STKs annually in the foreseeable future primarily through licensing agreements, provided that we have sufficient interest from prospective licensees, acceptable locations and quality restaurant managers available to support that pace of growth. From time to time, based on the quality of the opportunity and our current strategy, we may open one or more company-owned restaurants.
 
F&B Hospitality Services Business
 
We believe that through our developmental and operational knowledge and know-how, we are able to provide comprehensive tailored food and beverage solutions to our hospitality clients. Our fee-based hospitality food and beverage solutions include developing, managing and operating restaurants, bars, rooftops, pools, banqueting, catering, private dining rooms, room service and mini bars on a contract basis. Currently we are operating under five F&B hospitality management agreements with hotels and casinos throughout the United States and in Europe. Historically, our clients have provided the majority of the capital required for the development of the facilities we manage on their behalf. Our F&B hospitality contracts generate revenues for us through management fees, which are typically calculated as a percentage of the operation’s revenues, as well as additional milestone and incentive fees based on the operation’s profitability. We typically target F&B hospitality service opportunities where we believe we can generate $500,000 to $750,000 of pre-tax income. We expect our food and beverage hospitality services business to be an important driver of our growth and profitability going forward, enabling us to generate management fee income with minimal capital expenditures.

We believe we are well positioned to leverage the strength of our brands and the relationships we have developed with global hospitality providers to drive the continued growth of our F&B hospitality business model. We continue to receive inbound inquiries regarding new opportunities globally, as well as continue to work with existing hospitality clients to identify and develop additional opportunities in their venues. Going forward, we expect to enter into one to two new F&B hospitality agreements annually.
 
Sourcing and Supply Chain
 
We seek to ensure consistent quality of the food and beverages served at all of our properties through the coordination and cooperation of our purchasing and culinary departments. All product specifications are established on a global basis by our culinary and purchasing teams, which are then disseminated to all locations through recipe books for all dishes served at our properties.
 
We maintain consistent, high quality, pricing standards and procedures for all top volume purchases at our restaurants. Suppliers are selected and pricing is negotiated on a national level in each country where one or more of our restaurants operate. We test new suppliers on a regional basis for an extended period prior to utilizing them on a national basis. We periodically review supplier consistency and satisfaction with our location chefs and continually research and evaluate products and supplies to ensure the meat, seafood and other menu ingredients that we purchase comply with our high quality specifications. We also utilize purchasing software at some of our locations to facilitate a true bidding process on local purchases. In markets where we have not instituted this software, we require local chefs to seek bids from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing. We believe we have strong relationships with national and regional foodservice distributors who can continue to supply us with our products on a consistent basis. Products are shipped directly to the restaurants from our suppliers.
 
Our corporate beverage program imposes guidelines for ordering beverage products at our properties. Beverage managers at each location are provided with national guidelines for standardized products. We utilize a third-party company to conduct beverage inventory and cost reviews. Our concepts emphasize the bar as a driver of activity in the restaurants and in 2017, the sale of alcoholic beverages accounted for approximately 34% of restaurant revenues.
 
On a company-wide basis, no supplier of food accounts for more than 30% of our total food and beverage purchases and no brand of alcohol accounts for more than 25% of such purchases. We believe that our food and beverage supplies are available from a significant number of alternate suppliers and that the loss of a supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our costs of supplies.
 
Advertising and Marketing
 
Our marketing efforts are designed to strengthen our brand recognition in markets where we currently operate and to create brand awareness in new markets prior to opening a new location. We use digital/social media channels, targeted local media such as magazines, billboards and other out of home advertising, and a strong internal public relations team to increase the frequency with which our existing customers visit our facilities and to attract new customers. We conduct frequent promotional programs tailored to the city, brand and clientele of each location. The primary focus of our marketing is to increase awareness of our brand and our overall reputation for quality, service and delivering a high-energy experience. For example, our “Not Your Daddy’s Steakhouse” branding campaign for STK is integrated into marketing communications including digital, radio, print and outdoor advertisement. Additional marketing functions include the use of our website, www.togrp.com, to facilitate online reservations and gift card sales to drive revenue.
Competition
 
The restaurant and hospitality industries are intensely competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambiance of facilities and type and quality of food. We experience competition from a variety of sources, such as upscale steakhouse chains such as Del Frisco’s, Flemings and The Capital Grille, as well as local upscale steakhouses. There is also competition from other upscale and high-energy restaurants such as Nobu and Lavo, as well as other high-end hospitality services companies such as the Gerber Group, Lettuce Entertain You and Esquared Hospitality. To the extent that we operate lounges and similar venues in hotels and resorts, we are subject to our host venues being able to compete effectively in attracting customers who would frequent our establishments.

Seasonality
 
Our business is subject to fluctuations due to seasonality and adverse weather. Because of the seasonality of the business and the industry, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or the full calendar year. Typically, our second and fourth quarters have higher sales volume than other quarters of the year.
Intellectual Property
 
Our rights in our registered and unregistered intellectual property, including trademarks and service marks, are significant to our business. We are the owners of the U.S. federal registration rights to the “STK,” “Cucina Asellina” and “Asellina” marks, as well as several related word marks and design marks related to our brands. We depend on registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks to maintain the identity of our locations. We license the rights to use certain trademarks we own or license to our licensees in connection with their operations. We also own several other trademarks and service marks. It is our policy to defend our marks against encroachment by others.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 50 persons (inclusive of 7 in reservations and 6 in event planning) in our corporate office and an aggregate of 103 full-time salaried employees at our locations. In addition, we rely on hourly-wage employees for kitchen staff, servers, bussers, runners, polishers, hosts, bartenders, barbacks, reservationists, administrative support, and interns. Average head count for employees in our restaurants is 88. Combining full-time and part-time employees, we employ and manage approximately 2,000 persons worldwide. We have never experienced a work stoppage and our employees are not represented by labor organization.
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulation, including health, safety, labor, sanitation, building and fire agencies in the state, county, municipality or jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. In certain states, our restaurants are subject to “dram shop” statutes, which generally provides a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We maintain the necessary restaurant, alcoholic beverage and retail licenses, permits and approvals. Federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. The development and construction of additional restaurants are also subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. A failure to comply with one or more regulations could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the closing of restaurants for an indeterminate period of time, fines or third party litigation.
Available Information
 
We are subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act. We therefore file period reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Such reports may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains an internet site (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.
 
Additionally, copies of our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and any amendments to such reports are available for viewing and copying through our internet site (www.togrp.com), free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing it to, the SEC. We typically post information about us on our website under the Investor Relations tab, including materials used at investor conferences. We do not incorporate any information found or accessible through our website into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
We also make available on our website and in print to any stockholder who requests it, our Audit and Compensation Committees charters, as well as the Code of Conduct that applies to all directors, officers and associates of the company. Amendments to these documents or waivers related to the Code of Conduct will be made available on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after their execution.
