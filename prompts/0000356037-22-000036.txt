Item 1.     Business
CSP Inc. ("CSPi" or "CSPI" or "the Company" or "we" or "our") was incorporated in 1968 and is based in Lowell, Massachusetts. To meet the diverse requirements of our commercial and defense customers worldwide, CSPi and its subsidiaries develop and market IT integration solutions, advanced security products, managed IT services, cloud services, purpose built network adapters, and high-performance cluster computer systems.
Segments
CSPI operates in two segments: Technology Solutions ("TS") and High Performance Products ("HPP").
TS Segment

● | The TS segment consists of our wholly-owned Modcomp, Inc. subsidiary, which operates in the United States and the United Kingdom.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The TS segment generates product revenues by reselling third-party computer hardware and software as a value added reseller ("VAR"). The TS segment generates service revenues by the delivery of professional services for complex IT solutions, including advanced security; unified communications and collaboration; wireless and mobility; data center solutions; and network solutions as well as managed IT services ("MSP") that primarily serve the small and mid-sized business market ("SMB").
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Third party products and professional services are marketed and sold through the Company’s direct sales force into a variety of vertical markets, including; automotive; defense; health care; education; federal, state and local government; and maritime.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HPP Segment





● | The HPP segment revenue comes from three distinct product lines: (i) a cybersecurity solution marketed as ARIA™ Software-Defined Security (“SDS”), which is offered to commercial, original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") and government customers; (ii) the Myricom® network adapters for commercial, government and OEM customers; and (iii) the legacy Multicomputer product portfolio for digital signal processing ("DSP") applications within the defense markets.​
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ARIA SDS solution is a software portfolio starting with an underlying platform, hosted applications that reside on top, as well as any supporting hardware then deployed in turn-key security deployments. All are developed to secure an organization’s network, enterprise-wide, to better protect critical devices, applications and high-value data from breaches or other disruptive attacks. Revenue is derived from: (i) license sales of our software platform components, (ii) supporting hardware and (iii) any required support packages. The software licenses, as well as the support packages, are renewable on a recurring basis. The ARIA SDS platform and applications can also be deployed on customer provided virtual machines or on our Myricom SmartNIC adapters which can be directly inserted into our customers servers or integrated as part of our turn-key appliances. Either of these approaches can be deployed into a customer’s data center environments or within Cloud Platform services such as AWS and Azure to provide cybersecurity services. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | The ARIA portfolio is of value to regulated industries, such as financial services or healthcare, due to the rise of data-privacy regulations enforced at the federal, U.S. state, and international level, as well as industry entities. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting increase in hybrid remote workforce models, we believe ARIA SDS will provide additional protection against exploits entering in from home-based computers and networks. In addition, due to the complexities and high-costs associated with enterprise-wide security, particularly in the creation and operation of Security Operation Centers (“SOCs”), we believe that ARIA will be attractive to organizations that desire SOC level protections without incurring the procurement of disparate 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tools and the need to hire and retain highly-trained security analysts. We also have begun selling our unique, solution into Managed Security Service Providers (“MSSPs”) that want to offer a lower cost, more effective service at detecting todays widening range of cyber attacks. The ARIA SDS portfolio of software based products will continue to expand based on customer feedback during Fiscal 2023. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | The Myricom SmartNIC adapters (“ARC Series” and Myricom Secure Intelligent Adapters or “SIA”) are optimized for and sold into markets that require high-bandwidth and low-latency including (i) packet capture, (ii) financial transactions, (iii) machine vision and (iv) network security. Our primary customers for packet capture include government agencies that need to capture and/or analyze network traffic at line rate, and OEMs selling into vendors of computer security appliances. Financial institutions, such as banks and brokerage firms, use Myricom adapters to decrease transaction times. Our machine vision customers, primarily in the manufacturing industry, use our adapters and software for high fidelity video capture and processing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | There was limited revenue for HPP products in fiscal 2022. This was primarily due to supply chain issues which delayed delivery of components used by our Myricom Hardware. We hope to clear the majority of our backlog during the first half of FY 2023.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Multicomputer products for DSP applications are no longer actively developed but will continue to be sold into established programs and supported for several years. Revenue flows come from servicing previously deployed products for a modest number of existing high-value defense customers. The revenue from these products, as a percentage of overall Company revenue, is expected to continue to decline over time.

Markets and Marketing 
We are an IT systems integrator and computer hardware and software VAR. We also provide technical services to achieve a value-add to our customers. We operate within the VAR sales channels of major computer hardware and software OEMs, primarily within the geographic areas of our sales offices and across the U.S. We provide innovative IT solutions, including a myriad of infrastructure products with customized professional IT consulting services and managed services to meet the unique requirements of our customers. We market the products and services we sell through sales offices in the U.S. and the U.K. using our direct sales force.
Competition
Our primary competition in the TS segment are other VARs ranging from small companies that number in the thousands, to large enterprises such as CDW, PC Connection, Insight, Presidio, Dimension Data, and Computacenter Limited. In addition, we compete directly with many of the companies that manufacture the third-party products we sell, including Cisco Systems, IBM, HPE, EMC (now part of Dell) and others. In the network management, security and storage systems integration services business, our competitors are extensive and vary to a certain degree in each of the geographical markets, but they also include such national competitors as HP/EDS, IBM and Cap Gemini.
Nearly all of our product offerings are available through other channels. Favorable competitive factors for the TS segment include procurement capability, product diversity which enables the delivery of complete and custom solutions to our customers and the strength of our key business relationships with the major IT OEMs. We also consider our ability to meet the unique and/or specialized needs of the SMB and LEB markets and our strong knowledge of the IT products that we sell to be a key competitive advantage. Our ability to provide managed services through our network operations center and the professional IT services required to design and implement custom IT solutions to address our customers' IT needs are distinct competitive advantages. Unfavorable competitive factors include low name recognition, limited geographic coverage and pricing.
