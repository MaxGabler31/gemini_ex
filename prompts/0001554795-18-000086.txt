Item 1. Description of Business
General
 
TimefireVR Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our” the “Company” and “Timefire”) was originally incorporated in the State of Colorado on February 16, 1984 under the name of Oravest Interests, Inc.  On April 10, 2002 we re-domiciled to the State of Nevada under the name Broadleaf Capital Partners, Inc. On July 23, 2014 we changed our name to EnergyTek Corp. since the Company was engaged in the oil and gas business. On November 21, 2016, we changed our name to TimefireVR Inc. We are currently in the process of changing our name to TeraForge Ventures Inc.
 
On March 31, 2014 we closed a transaction whereby we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Texas Gulf Oil & Gas, Inc., a Nevada corporation, which were contributed to our then wholly-owned subsidiary Texas Gulf Exploration & Production, Inc. On March 31, 2014, we also closed a transaction whereby we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Litigation Capital, Inc., a Nevada corporation, which were contributed to our then wholly-owned subsidiary Legal Capital Corp.
 
On January 6, 2015, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Wagley Offshore-Onshore, Inc. to pursue a distressed energy asset acquisition program. The joint venture was formed as Wagley-EnergyTEK J.V. LLC, a Texas limited liability company, to which we issued 2,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock.
 
Sale of Our Existing Business
 
Effective September 13, 2016, the Company acquired Timefire, LLC (“TLLC”), a Phoenix-based virtual reality content developer which is an Arizona limited liability company. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued the equity holders of TLLC a total of 41,400,000 shares of the Company's common stock and 2,800,000 five-year warrants, which constituted a change of control of the Company (the “Merger”).
 
In December 2016, the Company transferred ownership of its legacy oil and gas subsidiaries and Legal Capital Corp. to Litigation Capital, Inc. in exchange for Litigation Capital, Inc. assuming approximately $180,000 of the Company’s liabilities.
 
On January 3, 2018, the Company effected the sale of TLLC to a group which included its former owners including two of our former executive officers and directors. The Company received: (i) $100,000 in cash and (ii) a secured promissory note in the principal amount of $120,000 bearing 6% annual interest that matures in September 2018. Additionally, the buyers of TLLC assumed certain of the Company’s liabilities totaling approximately $558,054. The Company’s business model in the virtual reality business was not successful and the Company was unable to continue to finance its business due to a loss of confidence in the virtual reality business by the Company’s investors and threats of resignation from the Company’s officers, directors and lead technologist and TLLC employees. While shareholder approval was required by Nevada law, the purchasers refused to fund TLLC unless we closed immediately. Certain investors that had financed the Company had agreed to provide further funding if we sold TLLC and received a release from key liabilities including past due promissory notes. Rather than cease operations and have no working capital, we adhered to the TLLC purchasers' demands and closed the sale. Pending finalization of the sale of TLLC over the year-end holidays, these investors lent us approximately $669,000 on December 21, 2017 and cancelled past due notes held by the investors on January 3, 2018 as explained in the following paragraph. Because we needed to eliminate state law liabilities, we opted to get irrevocable proxies which would permit us to seek shareholder ratification. We have filed a preliminary proxy statement which has not yet been finalized. We expect to file an amendment by mid-April 2018.
 
Effective January 3, 2018, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange”) with certain of the Company’s investors pursuant to which the Company issued 303,714 shares of the Company’s new Convertible Series E Preferred Stock in exchange for the cancellation of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, Senior Convertible Notes issued March 3, 2017, Senior Convertible Notes issued August 21, 2017, and certain of the Company’s outstanding Warrants. This Exchange had the effect of simplifying our capital structure and eliminating past due secured debt while substantially increasing future potential dilution. Effective December 21, 2017, we closed a private placement with our principal investors in which we borrowed $668,750 and issued the investors $703,947 in 5% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Notes which Notes were due January 18, 2018, convertible at $0.03 per share and pay 8% per annum interest. The short-term nature was designed to ensure the TLLC sale closed in early January. On March 6, 2018, we borrowed $1 million from these same investors and issued them $1,052,632 new 5% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Notes (the "March Notes") which are due on April 15, 2019. The March Notes pay 8% per annum interest and are convertible at $0.03 per share. On the maturity date, we must pay 120% of the principal of the March Notes. The March Notes are secured by a first lien on the Company's assets. For information on the warrants we issued, see Item 8 “Financial Statements” Note 11. Also on March 6, 2018, the investors extended their other Convertible Notes to April 15, 2019.
 
Summary of Recent Developments
 
On January 3, 2018, we announced our entry into the cryptocurrency business. As of April 6, 2018, we owned approximately $41,000 worth of Ether. In addition to its current business, the Company intends to enter into the cryptocurrency mining business. In order to enter the cryptocurrency mining business, we entered into an Advisory Agreement with two parties on March 16, 2018. Under the Advisory Agreement, the parties will provide consulting services to us concerning cryptocurrency mining and other opportunities in the cryptocurrency business. The parties to the Advisory Agreement will also provide us with an engineer who will provide half-time services to us in the mining business under which he will provide logistical advice and mining oversight including designing, and building overhead operating proprietary software, and monitoring operations of the mining systems. Under the Advisory Agreement, we agreed to reimburse one party $5,000 per month for the services of the mining engineer. Assuming we have entered into the mining business within 90 days, we agreed to pay a sales royalty as additional consideration. Further, upon finalizing the agreement, we will issue 6,666,666 shares of common stock (with an agreed value of $200,000) which will vest quarterly subject to the Advisory Agreement remaining in effect on each applicable vesting date and an additional 6,666,666 three-year warrants exercisable at $0.05 with the same vesting provisions.
Our Bitcoin Mining Business
 
In late March we entered into a co-location arrangement with an unaffiliated third party in the mining business. We ordered high speed computer servers and, in early April 2018, after delivery of the servers, will initiate our mining of Bitcoin. The intent of this purchase and location is to allow us to solidify, test and validate our hardware and software operating systems prior to expanding our mining operations. We are currently evaluating locations in Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Wyoming for mining and are considering the costs, management, and security advantages of each potential future location. See the general discussion of mining beginning at page 5 of this Report.

Cryptocurrency Business
 
We have been negotiating a series of agreements with Cryptogram, LLC (“Cryptogram”) including a License Agreement (the “License”). Cryptogram is a development stage company developing cryptocurrency data analytics, portfolio management, a cryptocurrency trading platform, and an information sharing software program. The software program being developed is designed for traders of cryptocurrency and is being designed to provide real price and volume information similar to how Bloomberg’s software programs are used in the capital markets. Cryptogram has developed prototype software which can be used on a computer and mobile devices by cryptocurrency investors in tracking prices and receiving technical data and other information which we believe can be sold to investors. The initial target is to complete the development of the first stage for sale to individual investors on a monthly fee basis with further development for the professional market when Cryptogram raises additional funds.
 
Under a term sheet we entered into with Cryptogram, we will pay Cryptogram $500,000 for the License. Additionally, we will issue Cryptogram $250,000 of our new Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for a 10% interest in Cryptogram and a Warrant to acquire up to an additional 30% of Cryptogram for $10 million. The License to the Cryptogram software will allow us to market the software to individual retail investors. Although we believe that we will finalize our agreements with Cryptogram in April, there are no assurances that we will successfully enter into any agreements with Cryptogram or acquire the License.
 
The Company intends to acquire Bitcoin, Ether, and invest in other cryptocurrency technologies.
 
Bitcoins and the Bitcoin Network
 
A Bitcoin is one type of cryptocurrency that is issued by, and transmitted through, an open source, math-based protocol platform using cryptographic security that is known as the “Bitcoin Network.” The Bitcoin Network is an online, peer-to-peer user network that hosts the public transaction ledger, known as the “Blockchain,” and the source code that comprises the basis for the cryptography and math-based protocols governing the Bitcoin Network. Bitcoins can be used to pay for goods and services or can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar. Bitcoins are the initial and leading cryptocurrency and therefore offer the greatest mining opportunity.
 
Bitcoin transactions and ownership are recorded and reflected on the digital transaction ledger known as the “Blockchain,” which is a digital file stored in a decentralized manner on the computers of each Bitcoin Network user. The Blockchain records the transaction history of all Bitcoins in existence and, through the transparent reporting of transactions, allows the Bitcoin Network to verify the association of each Bitcoin with the digital wallet that owns them. Users keep their Bitcoins in an electronic computer file known as a digital wallet.
 
The Bitcoin Network is decentralized and does not rely on either governmental authorities or financial institutions to create, transmit or determine the value of Bitcoins. Rather, Bitcoins are created and allocated by the Bitcoin Network protocol through a “mining” process subject to a strict, well-known issuance schedule.
 
Overview of the Bitcoin Network’s Operations
 
In order to own, transfer or use Bitcoins, a person generally must have internet access to connect to the Bitcoin Network. Bitcoin transactions between parties occur very rapidly (within several seconds) and may be made directly between end-users without the need for a third-party intermediary, although there are entities that provide third-party intermediary services. To prevent the possibility of double-spending a single Bitcoin, a user must notify the Bitcoin Network of the transaction by broadcasting the transaction data to its network peers. The Bitcoin Network provides confirmation against double-spending by memorializing every transaction in the Blockchain, which is publicly accessible and transparent. This memorialization and verification against double-spending is accomplished through the Bitcoin mining process, which adds “blocks” of data, including recent transaction information, to the Blockchain.
Transaction Verification (Mining)
 
The process by which Bitcoins are “mined” results in new blocks being added to the Blockchain and new Bitcoins being issued to the miners. Miners engage in a set of prescribed complex mathematical calculations in order to add a block to the Blockchain and thereby confirm Bitcoin transactions included in that block’s data. Miners that are successful in adding a block to the Blockchain are automatically awarded a fixed number of Bitcoins for their effort; we also refer to this process of receiving the aforementioned award as transaction verification services. This reward system is the method by which new Bitcoins enter into circulation to the public and is accomplished in the added block through the notation of the new Bitcoin creation and their allocation to the successful miner’s digital wallet. To begin mining, a user can download and run Bitcoin Network mining software, which, like regular Bitcoin Network software programs, turns the user’s computer into a “node” on the Bitcoin Network that validates blocks. Due to the enhanced investor interest in Bitcoin, there has been large increases in, and a scarcity of, computer servers needed for mining. Additionally, since these high-speed servers use vast amounts of electricity, there has been a spike in the prices of electricity in the areas where mining has been prevalent. These areas were selected for their then low prices. The “poster boy or girl” for mining is Bitcoin mining which uses huge amounts of electricity to operate the computer servers. Miners sought out areas where electric power was relatively inexpensive. This has caused electricity prices to spike in these areas. Locations such as East Wenatchee, Washington have witnessed a swell in occupants and business as miners relocate to areas with cheap electricity. The mining industry has witnessed a change from small miners operating from their homes to large mining “farms” operated by companies with substantial capital, computer resources and other capabilities and competitive advantages. As electricity prices have risen as a result of mining, local officials have become alarmed because area residents are forced to pay more for their electricity. Very recently, Plattsburg, NY banned certain aspects of mining.
 
We have purchased servers and entered into an arrangement with a mining company that will permit us to commence mining operations. We anticipate that we will commence our actual mining by April 10, 2018 from our mining location in Brooklyn, NY

Alternative cryptocurrencies
 
Bitcoins are not the only type of cryptocurrency founded on math-based algorithms and cryptographic security, although it was considered the most prominent as of March 2018. Over 1,500 other cryptocurrencies, have been developed since the Bitcoin Network’s inception, including Ether, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash, and Monero. The Bitcoin Network, however, possesses the “first-to-market” advantage and thus far has captured the majority of the industry’s market share and is secured by a mining network with significantly more processing power than that of any other cryptocurrency. The Company is examining and will continue to examine these other cryptocurrencies, subject to financing, existing market conditions and regulatory compliance.
 
In 2017, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experienced substantial price increases particularly in the late fall with extreme volatility beginning in the second half of December as illustrated by the following chart showing the price of Bitcoin from December 1, 2017 through March 30, 2018:
 


As the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rose, the speculative fever brought substantial competition to the business both from established companies, early stage entrants and bad actors. The effect has been to make existing and new businesses much more expensive due to the growing demand and relatively limited supply.
 
Competition
 
As we enter this business, we face substantial competition and a myriad of other risks. We have one employee, our Chief Executive Officer, and relatively limited financial and other resources. See the “Risk Factors” that are at the end of Item 9. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” including the regulatory section under the section of “Risk Factors” entitled “Risk of Future Cryptocurrency Legislation and Regulation.”
Cryptocurrency
 
Subject to raising additional capital, the Company’s cryptocurrency initiatives will compete with other industry participants that focus on investing in and mining of Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Company’s control, may make it more attractive to invest in other entities, or to invest in cryptocurrency directly. Companies have raised substantial capital this year seeking to enter the cryptocurrency business. Our lack of capital is a competitive disadvantage.
Mining
 
The business of mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency is extremely competitive. Over the last several years as costs have spiked and the price of Bitcoin increased, large sources of capital have entered the mining business. This factor, as well as the prior experience and technical capabilities of our competitors, puts us at a competitive disadvantage.
Cryptocurrency Software Business
 
If we acquire the License our potential competitors may have greater resources, longer histories, and lower cost operations. Several other companies offer cryptocurrency software which provides users with the ability to buy, sell, and access important cryptocurrency information. They may secure better terms from server suppliers and devote more resources to technology infrastructure. Other companies may also enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.
Employees 
 
We currently have one full time employee, our Chief Executive Officer. Our Chief Financial Officer is a part-time contractor.
 
Regulation
 
Because we will buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrency, we are subject to numerous federal and state laws around the world regarding cryptocurrency. The scope of these regulations are continuing to evolve, and they may be inconsistent among the locations in which we operate and our users reside. Compliance with these rules may be difficult and costly, and if we fail to comply, we could face liability under these statutes and legal or administrative actions by government entities and private litigants. See “Risk Factors” below, for further discussion of the risks we face.
Facilities
 
See Item 2. “Description of Property.”
