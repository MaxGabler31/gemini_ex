BioNexus Malaysia

BioNexus Malaysia is an emerging molecular diagnostics company focused on the application of functional genomics to enable early diagnosis and personalized health management. Our focus is on developing and marketing safe, effective and non-invasive blood tests for early detection of diseases in order to minimize treatment cost and improve patient management. Our non-invasive blood tests analyze changes in ribonucleic acid (or RNA) to detect the risk potentiality of 11 different diseases. These diseases include eight cancers (nasopharyngeal, lung, liver, stomach, breast, cervical, prostate and colon), two bowel diseases (colitis and Crohn) and osteoarthritis. This unique blood based genomic biomarker approach is based on the scientific observation that circulating blood reflects, in a detectable way, what is occurring throughout the body currently.

The Company believes that its blood based genomic screening protocol for the risk of disease detection can be utilized in conjunction with other medical procedures for disease detection including blood tests, imaging and biopsies. We market our blood based genomic screening process to health care providers, such as doctors, laboratories and hospitals, which began in July 2017.

Our principal office address is Unit 02, Level 10, Tower B, Avenue 3, The Vertical Business Suite II, Bangsar South, No. 8 Jalan Kerinchi, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, our lab is located at Lab 353, Chemical Science Centre, University Science Malaysia, George Town, Penang, Malaysia, and we have a blood collection center located at 1st Floor, Lifecare Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Acquisition of BGS Lab Sdn. Bhd.

On August 23, 2017, BioNexus Gene Lab Corp., a Wyoming company, acquired all of the capital stock of Bionexus Gene Lab Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian company (“BioNexus Malaysia”), from its then existing shareholders. In connection with the transaction, the following shareholders of BioNexus Malaysia received the corresponding number of shares of our common stock; Soo Kow Lai, our Chairman, received 10,000,000 shares; Chi Yuen Leong, our President received 10,000,000 shares; Mr. Chan Chong Wong, our Chief Executive Officer received 10,000,000 shares; and late Dr. Choong Chin Liew, our Scientific Adviser received 20,000,000 shares. In exchange, we received certain software, equipment, know-how, related inventory and technology relating to blood based genomic analysis and screening developed by Dr. Liew which had enabled us to conduct our current operations. The technology and related assets were previously acquired by the BioNexus Malaysia from Dr. Liew in June 2017 in exchange for Dr. Liew receiving 40% of the equity of BioNexus Malaysia and the obligation to pay Dr. Liew the sum of approximately $354,930. The Company paid Dr. Liew the sum of $83,664 on January 23, 2018 and on February 15, 2018, Dr. Liew agreed to waive the remaining balance due to him by the Company which amounted to $271,266.
Development of the Blood Analysis Process.

Our company’s major shareholder, Dr. Liew, developed and tested a novel approach in blood based genomic analysis and screening by identifying biomarkers in RNA as opposed to deoxyribonucleic acid (or DNA) analysis. Through his extensive research and clinical trials, he had determined that communication occurs between cells in blood and tissue as blood circulates throughout the body and subtle changes occur in cells over time due to injury or disease. These cell-cell interactions induce changes in blood gene expression. Profiling these changes enables the Company to identify unique molecular signatures reflecting disease activity which can then be used to develop disease-specific molecular diagnostic assays. The Company uses disease-specific blood-based biomarkers as the basis for molecular diagnostics tests and to enable personalized health management through the development of systems biology tools and algorithms.

The Company focuses on developing and commercializing proprietary molecular diagnostic tests for early detection of diseases and personalized health management, with a primary focus on cardiovascular, diabetes and cancer-related indications. There is a constant and dynamic interaction of blood with cells, tissues and organs of the human body. Many clinical studies performed by Dr. Liew and others have demonstrated that blood gene expression profiles can be used to develop personalized signatures capable of differentiating patients with cancer from healthy patients across a broad spectrum of pathologies interaction between tumor cells and the immune system that has been referred to as immunoediting. Immunoediting is the response of the immune system to a tumor and comprises three stages: elimination (in which the immune system identifies cancerous and/or precancerous cells and attempts to eradicate them), equilibrium (in which the surviving tumor cells begin mutating rapidly), and escape (in which tumor cells proliferate uncontrollably, leading to tumor progression). Each of these stages induces leukocyte gene expression changes that constitute a unique, detectable molecular signature.

Dr. Liew began his research in 1962 and has published numerous articles in medical and peer review journals. His publications include the following;

Peripheral Blood Transcriptome Dynamically Reflects System-wide Biology: A Potential Diagnostic Tool. Liew CC, Ma J, Tang HC, Zheng R, Dempsey AA. Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine (March 2006).

The Peripheral Blood Transcriptome: New Insights into Disease and Risk Assessment. Mohr, S Liew CC. Trends in Molecular Medicine (October 2007).

DNA and RNA each consist of a single molecule and both are present in the blood. DNA is the carrier of human genetic information and is passed down from generation to generation. At conception, a person receives DNA from both parents. All of the cells in our bodies, except red blood cells, contain a copy of our DNA. Humans share about 99% of the same genetic code. However, it is the 1% of the genetic code that makes us all very distinct individuals. Historically, the study of DNA has been used to detect ancestry and inherited characteristics, including certain inherited diseases like Huntington Disease, Cystic Fibrosis and Down Syndrome, among others. It also is believed there is a genetic (DNA) pre-disposition to certain cancers, like breast cancer, colon cancer and gastric cancer.

While DNA is relatively static, RNA conversely is subject to change and is affected by an individual’s lifestyle, such as diet, alcohol, tobacco and/or drug use, excessive or ongoing stress from work/family and exercise, along with exposure to environmental influences, such as pollutants and chemicals.

The distinctions between the characteristics of RNA and DNA are illustrated in the below table.



· Static | · Dynamic 
--------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
· Measures lifetime risk | · Measure current risk 
· Repeated test does not provide different result | · Repeated test provides different result 
· DNA does not change with external factors | · Lifestyle and external factors affect RNA expression 

The Collection and Analysis Process.

Our process involves a simple blood draw. A nurse or technician of the health care provider draws 2.5 ml of blood from the patient using a Paxgene blood tube. The blood and a completed company form are couriered to our lab located at 353, Chemical Science Centre, USM, George Town. All blood samples are labelled with name and personal identity number and laboratory reference number on the tube where the blood sample is maintained for safekeeping.

At our lab, RNA is extracted in biosafety cabinet followed by microcentrifuge and spectrophotometer to check spectrophotometric concentration and quality of the extracted RNA. The RNA then is purified (Biotinylated RNA will be mixed with purification beads and transferred to a U-bottom 96-well plate. Then, the plate will be placed onto a magnetic ring stand. Labeled cRNA will be captured when placed on the magnetic stand. The remaining solution will be removed and the captured pellet will be cleaned-up to obtain cRNA with high purity. Then, purified cRNA will be fragmented for hybridization) and hybridized onto a genechip (GeneChip 3’ IVT PLUS Reagent Kit will be used for preparing biotinylated target from purified total RNA samples suitable for hybridization to GeneChip arrays. Double-stranded cDNA will be synthesized from the total RNA using reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT primers. An in-vitro transcription (IVT) reaction is then done to produce biotin-labeled cRNA from the cDNA in 16 hours incubation) and scanned through the affymetrix station (Once the overnight hybridization is completed, the Genechips will be washed with dedicated buffers and solutions to remove excess cRNAs and hybridization solutions. Washed chips will be stained with staining buffers to illuminate attached cRNAs. All these processes will be conducted in the fluidic station by following the given instructions. Specific experimental information is defined using AMDS software on a PC-compatible workstation. Stained chips are ready for scanning. The chips will be transferred into the scanner. The scan is automatically completed and the image is processed into data files. The data collected from microarray analysis is analysed using our propriety software and algorithm calculation to generate the disease risk score report for the individual patient. A report is generated by our software and is forwarded to the health care provider for further consultation with the patient. This report can be used by patient and physician to plan future tests and therapies.

The process for effectuating RNA analysis depicted in the below pictures.

The raw data obtained will be analyzed and quality control processed by our lab in Malaysia using our proprietary software to calculate the risk analysis of 11 different diseases. We simplify the result into a graph which is contained in the patient booklet provided to the health care professional. A sample graph is depicted below.


In the above chart, NPC is Nasopharyngeal Cancer, ATDS is Ascending, Transverse, Descending and Sigmoid Colon Cancer, and OA is Osteoarthritis.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following cautionary text in contained in the results booklet which the Company provides to each patient:

This report/screening is not intended or implied to be substitute for professional medical advice, diagnostics or treatment. The content, including text, graphics and information in the report illustrate the risk score only. Bionexus Gene Lab Sdn Bhd makes no representation and assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the information as such information and contents are subject to change without notice. You are encouraged to review any medical condition or treatment with your doctor.

The key proprietary aspect of our process is our proprietary algorithm software and the RNA extraction, preservation, quality control, hybridization, data analysis processes which was developed by Dr. Liew. We acquired the software and the technological processes in June 2017. The gene expression from a reference population representing a specific disease condition is filtered according to a quality assurance process based on repeatability data. This collected data is then analyzed by our proprietary algorithm software and processes checked by the laboratory manager to ensure all the steps are followed in the deriving predictive model for each disease condition. Once these models have been established, they then can be applied to the data from a new sample to make risk prediction for this individual. Each disease/disorder has similar group of diseased/disordered genes which were identified through the years of research and clinical trials in Malaysia.

Business Development.

As mentioned above, the screening provides a risk analysis of 11 diseases, of which eight are different forms of cancer. In Malaysia, the cost for the analysis is not covered by health insurance. Thus, patients are required to pay for the costs of the services, which under our current pricing of $975 for the 11-disease panel for an individual plan. We do have different pricing for groups, like companies and associations.

As of December 31, 2021, we have 10 swab and blood sample collection centers, 8 in Klang Valley (which is comprised of our capital city Kuala Lumpur, together with towns on the northern and southern fringes of the capital city) recommending our blood based genomic screening protocol to their patients. Of these centers, Lifecare Medical Centre, Iheal Medical Centre, National Heart Centre, 1-Utama Clinic, Clinic Q, LYC Healthcare, Gene Therapy Centre, Nexus Reality Lab in Klang Valley, Sandakan hospital and Tawau Hospital and account for approximately 90% of our patient population from Jan 2020 through December 31, 2021. We believe that there are over 500 clinics and hospitals located in the Kuala Valley metropolitan area.

Our goal is to have a large percentage of health care providers in the Klang Valley refer patients to us for our screening protocol. Once we have established our brand and reputation in Klang Valley, we intend to expend to other large cities in Malaysia, followed by an expansion to large metropolitan areas other countries in Asia Pacific, such as Indonesia, Taiwan and Singapore. However, we do not foresee expansion beyond Malaysia until fiscal year 2022 and beyond.

Our existing equipment and personnel are sufficient to handle up to 94 patients a day. If our daily patient count increases above 200 patients, we will be required to hire another laboratory technician and purchase and install an additional semi-automatic Affymetrix station equipment estimate to be $200,000.

For health care providers, we pay a referral fee of between 20% to 25%. Typically, the patient, while in the offices of the health care provider, completes a form which identifies the name, address and other contact information of the patient.

During the 3rd fiscal quarter of 2020, we began testing for COVID 19 using our RNA platform apply qPCR process. During this period, the Ministry of Health began providing us with COVID samples taken at hospitals for testing using our laboratory. To date, we had screened more than 5,000 samples reported less than 100 positive covid-19 cases to the Health Ministry In addition, during 3rd quarter of 2020, we began promoting this q-PCR test through the Malaysian General & Life Insurance Association, various banks, airports and small and medium enterprises (SME) in Malaysia. The response from these markets have slow in developing. Our Covid screening generates substantially lower per ticket charges at $55 per test compared with $975 per customer for our RNA screening. They also generate lower margins than our RNA screenings.

Competition and Competitive Strengths.

While the Company believes that there is no similar commercialized blood based genomic screening for 11 diseases using RNA analysis, it believes that its blood based genomic screening protocol for disease detection could be utilized in conjunction with other medical procedures for disease diagnostics including lab (blood, urine or other body fluids) tests, imaging and biopsies. As such, the Company does not consider it to be in competition with these other medical procedures which have been industry standards for many years.

Disease detection for cancer, for example, are numerous and is dependent on the type of cancer tested. Information from the National Cancer Institute provides the following information;


· | Genetic testing, also known as DNA testing, allows the determination of bloodlines and the genetic diagnosis of vulnerabilities to inherited diseases. In humans, genetic testing can be used to determine a child’s parentage or in general a person’s ancestry; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Lab tests. High or low levels of certain substances in your body can be a sign of cancer. So, lab tests of the blood, urine, or other body fluids that measure these substances can help doctors make a diagnosis. However, abnormal lab results are not a sure sign of cancer. Lab tests are an important tool, but doctors cannot rely on them alone to diagnose cancer. Current tumour markers available in many countries including Malaysia are CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, PSA, AFP, β-hCG, CA 27.29. All are NOT suitable for screening and diagnostic use because of low sensitivity, specificity and predictive value. Source: American Family Physician (2003) Vol 68 (6)
· | Imaging Procedures. Imaging procedures create pictures of areas inside your body that help the doctor see whether a tumor is present. These pictures can be made in several ways, including a CT Scan, Nuclear Scan, MRI, PET Scan, among others. 
· | Biopsies. In most cases, doctors need to do a biopsy to make a diagnosis of cancer. A biopsy is a procedure in which the doctor removes a sample of tissue. A pathologist then looks at the tissue under a microscope to see if it is cancer.

We however believe that we have a number of competitive strengths compared these other health diagnostic tools are as follows:


· | Our screening is non-invasive (other than a simple blood draw), unlike biopsies; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | In one test, we can screen for 11 diseases unlike conventional diagnostics; 
· | Non-DNA blood tests for diseases like cancer are not dispositive and detect only elevated levels of proteins or other substances which are caused by cancer; 
· | DNA blood tests are limited to certain types of inherited diseases, Huntington Disease, Cystic Fibrosis and Down Syndrome, among others. Such inherited disease(s) may or may not happen in a person’ life time; 
· | MRI exams are uncomfortable and require fasting prior to testing, and implants in the body will distort result; 
· | Most importantly, our screening provides a predictive risk assessment for developing the 11 diseases. Most other disease detection procedures detect diseases already present in the body, and in most cases in the final stages of the disease making it difficult to treat or reverse. With our screening, patients are able to monitor the development of these diseases in the future through further medical testing, including using our protocol. In addition, patients are able to make adjustments to their lifestyles in an effort to reduce the potentiality of these diseases. Lifestyle adjustments may include reduction or changes to food, tobacco and alcohol intake, change of working environment and the implementation of exercise programs, among other changes.

Our Growth Strategy

We will look to grow and expand our business by further penetrating the Klang Valley market and expand our marketing efforts elsewhere in Malaysia. We believe that an increase in our marketing and promotional efforts will correlate to increased revenues and the expansion of our business. Our growth and expansion strategy for the next 6-12 months are as follows:

• Continue to leverage our relationships with healthcare providers
To date, we have relied upon the efforts of management and their relationships with health care providers to create the initial interest in our blood based genomic screening. These relationships have been located primarily in the Kuala Lumpur market. We will continue to use our relationships with providers in the Kuala Lumpur market and elsewhere in Malaysia to increase sales and product awareness.

• Allocate more capital resources to our marketing efforts
Apart from sales through existing relationships with health care providers, we intend to allocate more capital resources to marketing and promotion. As part of these efforts, we have appointed two commission-based Marketing Companies last year and they managed to bring some business after creating awareness of our services nationwide.

• Increase focus on corporate clients.
To date, we have entered into arrangements with two corporate clients for screening on their employees. We intend to solicit more corporate clients in the Klang Valley and major cities in Malaysia. We commenced these efforts last year and is continued in 2022. These efforts will be undertaken by the officers and the Marketing Companies.

• Expand to other regions in Malaysia.
We intend to reach other large cities in Malaysian, such as Penang, Ipoh, Seremban, Melaka, Johor Bahru and Kuantan.

Regulatory Matters

We are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulations. We are subject to the laws and regulations of those jurisdictions in wellness operation and advertising materials circulation. Generally, business licensing requirements, income taxes and payroll taxes are applicable to all types of business operations. The development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements. In 2007, the Malaysian Parliament passed the Pathology Laboratory Bill of 2007 (“Pathology Act”), subject to the finalization of the underlying regulations. Since the passage of the Pathology Act, the Malaysian government has not implemented the legislation. Currently, we are only required an operating permit from local council, which we have received. However, we cannot predict whether we would be able to comply with the Pathology Act and its regulations, if implemented.

Employees

As of the date of this this filing, BioNexus Malaysia has eight full-time employee and five directors/officers who work part-time. Management does not plan to hire additional employees at this time. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees.

Currently, BioNexus Malaysia has not entered into an employment agreement with any of our officers. The Company presently does not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, the Company may adopt plans in the future. Management does not plan to hire additional employees at this time.

Intellectual Property.

BioNexus Malaysia does not have any patents protecting our blood based genomic screening process. Instead, we rely on trade secrets and know-how using the process developed by Dr. Liew. There is no assurance that others will not independently develop the same or similar technology or obtain unauthorized access to our trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented technology. To protect our rights in these areas, we require all employees that work in our lab to enter into strict confidentiality agreements. Presently, we have one lab manager and 2 casual lab technicians. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our unpatented technology in the event of an unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure. While we have attempted to protect the unpatented proprietary technology that we develop or acquire, and will continue to attempt to protect future proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secrets, we believe that our success will depend, to a large extent, upon continued innovation and technological expertise.

In general, the level of protection afforded by a patent is directly proportional to the ability of the patent owner to protect and enforce those rights through legal action. Since our financial resources are limited, and patent litigation can be both expensive and time consuming, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully prosecute an infringement claim in the event that a competitor develops a technology or introduces a product that infringes on one or more of our patents or patent applications. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop other technologies that render our proposed products obsolete. In general, we believe the best protection of our proprietary technology will come from market position, technical innovation, speed-to-market, and product performance. There is no assurance that we will realize any benefit from our intellectual property rights.

Product Liability.

Due to nature of the Company’s business, the Company may face claims for product liability resulting from the inaccurate or erroneous diagnosis using our screening process. Presently, the Company does not maintain any product liability insurance to cover any claims for an erroneous diagnosis.
