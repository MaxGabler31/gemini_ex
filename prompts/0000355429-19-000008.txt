Item 1.    Business
Protective Life Corporation (the “Company”), is a holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, with subsidiaries that provide financial services primarily in the United States through the production, distribution, and administration of insurance and investment products. Founded in 1907, Protective Life Insurance Company (“PLICO”) is the Company’s largest operating subsidiary. Unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to the consolidated group of Protective Life Corporation and its subsidiaries.
On February 1, 2015, The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited, a kabushiki kaisha organized under the laws of Japan (now known as Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc., “Dai-ichi Life”), acquired 100% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock through the merger of DL Investment (Delaware), Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life, with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, the Company is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life.
The Company operates several operating segments, each having a strategic focus. An operating segment is distinguished by products, channels of distribution, and/or other strategic distinctions. The Company’s operating segments are Life Marketing, Acquisitions, Annuities, Stable Value Products, and Asset Protection. The Company has an additional reporting segment referred to as Corporate and Other which consists of net investment income on assets supporting our equity capital, unallocated corporate overhead, and expenses not attributable to the segments above (including interest on certain corporate debt). This segment also includes earnings from several non-strategic or runoff lines of business, financing and investment-related transactions, and the operations of several small subsidiaries. The Company periodically evaluates its operating segments and makes adjustments to our segment reporting as needed.
Additional information concerning the Company and its operating segments may be found in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 22, Operating Segments to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
In the following paragraphs, the Company reports sales and other statistical information. These statistics are used to measure the relative progress of its marketing and acquisition efforts, but may not have an immediate impact on reported segment or consolidated adjusted operating income. Sales data for traditional life insurance is based on annualized premiums, while universal life sales are based on annualized planned premiums, or “target” premiums if lesser, plus 6% of amounts received in excess of target premiums and 10% of single premiums. “Target” premiums for universal life are those premiums upon which full first year commissions are paid. Sales of annuities are measured based on the amount of purchase payments received less surrenders occurring within twelve months of the purchase payments. Stable value contract sales are measured at the time the purchase payments are received. Sales within the Asset Protection segment are based on the amount of single premiums and fees received.
These statistics are derived from various sales tracking and administrative systems and are not derived from the Company’s financial reporting systems or financial statements. These statistics attempt to measure only some of the many factors that may affect future profitability, and therefore, are not intended to be predictive of future profitability.
Life Marketing
The Life Marketing segment markets fixed universal life (“UL”), indexed universal life (“IUL”), variable universal life (“VUL”), bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”), and level premium term insurance (“traditional”) products on a national basis, primarily through networks of independent insurance agents and brokers, broker-dealers, financial institutions, independent distribution organizations, and affinity groups.
The following table presents the Life Marketing segment’s sales as defined above:

Acquisitions
The Acquisitions segment focuses on acquiring, converting, and servicing policies and contracts from other companies. The segment’s primary focus is on life insurance policies and annuity products that were sold to individuals. The level of the segment’s acquisition activity is predicated upon many factors, including available capital, operating capacity, potential return on capital, and market dynamics. The Company expects acquisition opportunities to continue to be available. However, the Company believes it may face increased competition and evolving capital requirements that may affect the environment and the form of future acquisitions.
Most acquisitions completed by the Acquisitions segment have not included the acquisition of an active sales force, thus policies acquired through the segment are typically blocks of business where no new policies are being marketed. Therefore, earnings and account values are expected to decline as the result of lapses, deaths, and other terminations of coverage, unless new acquisitions are made. The segment’s revenues and earnings may fluctuate from year to year depending upon the level of acquisition activity. In transactions where some marketing activity was included, the Company may cease future marketing efforts, redirect those efforts to another segment of the Company, or elect to continue marketing new policies as a component of other segments.
The Company believes that its focused and disciplined approach to the acquisition process and its experience in the assimilation, conservation, and servicing of acquired policies provides a significant competitive advantage. 
On May 1, 2018, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“Lincoln Life”) completed the acquisition (the “Closing”) of Liberty Mutual Group Inc.’s (“Liberty Mutual”) Group Benefits Business and Individual Life and Annuity Business (the “Life Business”) through the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Liberty Life Assurance Company of Boston (“Liberty”). In connection with the Closing and  pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement, dated January 18, 2018, PLICO and Protective Life and Annuity Insurance Company (“PLAIC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of PLICO, entered into reinsurance agreements (the “Reinsurance Agreements”) and related ancillary documents (including administrative services agreements and transition services agreements) providing for the reinsurance and administration of the Life Business.
Pursuant to the Reinsurance Agreements, Liberty ceded to PLICO and PLAIC the insurance policies related to the Life Business on a 100% coinsurance basis. The aggregate ceding commission for the reinsurance of the Life Business was $422.4 million, which is the purchase price. Other than cash received as part of the acquired Liberty investment portfolio as reflected in “amounts received from reinsurance transaction” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and as reflected in the table below, this was a non-cash transaction.
All policies issued in states other than New York were ceded to PLICO under a reinsurance agreement between Liberty and PLICO, and all policies issued in New York were ceded to PLAIC under a reinsurance agreement between Liberty and PLAIC.  The aggregate statutory reserves of Liberty ceded to PLICO and PLAIC as of the closing of the Transaction were approximately $13.2 billion, which amount was based on initial estimates and is subject to adjustment following the Closing. Pursuant to the terms of the Reinsurance Agreements, each of PLICO and PLAIC are required to maintain assets in trust for the benefit of Liberty to secure their respective obligations to Liberty under the Reinsurance Agreements. The trust accounts were initially funded by each of PLICO and PLAIC principally with the investment assets that were received from Liberty. Additionally, PLICO and PLAIC have each agreed to provide, on behalf of Liberty, administration and policyholder servicing of the Life Business reinsured by it pursuant to administrative services agreements between Liberty and each of PLICO and PLAIC.
On January 23, 2019, PLICO entered into a Master Transaction Agreement (the “GWL&A Master Transaction Agreement”) with Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company (“GWL&A”), Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company of New York (“GWL&A of NY”), The Canada Life Assurance Company (“CLAC”) and The Great-West Life Assurance Company (“GWL” and, together with GWL&A, GWL&A of NY and CLAC, the “Sellers”), pursuant to which PLICO will acquire via reinsurance (the “Transaction”) substantially all of the Sellers’ individual life insurance and annuity business (the “Individual Life Business”). Pursuant to the GWL&A Master Transaction Agreement, PLICO and PLAIC will enter into reinsurance agreements (the “Reinsurance Agreements”) and related ancillary documents at the closing of the Transaction. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Reinsurance Agreements, the Sellers will cede to PLICO and PLAIC, effective as of the closing of the Transaction, substantially all of the insurance policies relating to the Individual Life Business. To support its obligations under the Reinsurance Agreements, PLICO will establish trust accounts for the benefit of GWL&A, CLAC and GWL, and PLAIC will establish a trust account for the benefit of GWL&A of NY. The Sellers will retain a block of participating policies, which will be administered by the Company.
The Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the execution of the Reinsurance Agreements and related ancillary documents. The GWL&A Master Transaction Agreement and other transaction documents contain certain customary representations and warranties made by each of the parties, and certain customary covenants regarding the Sellers and the Individual Life Business, and provide for indemnification, among other things, for breaches of those representations, warranties and covenants.    
Annuities
The Annuities segment markets fixed and variable annuity (“VA”) products. These products are primarily sold through broker-dealers, financial institutions, and independent agents and brokers.
The Company’s variable annuities offer the policyholder the opportunity to invest in various investment accounts and offer optional features that guarantee the death and withdrawal benefits of the underlying annuity.
4

The Company’s fixed annuities include indexed annuities, single premium deferred annuities, and single premium immediate annuities. The Company’s fixed annuities also include modified guaranteed annuities which guarantee an interest rate for a fixed period. Contract values for these annuities are “market-value adjusted” upon surrender prior to maturity. In certain interest rate environments, these products afford the Company with a measure of protection from the effects of changes in interest rates. 
The demand for annuity products is related to the general level of interest rates, performance of the equity markets, and perceived risk of insurance companies. The following table presents fixed annuity and VA sales:

Successor Company

Stable Value Products
The Stable Value Products segment sells fixed and floating rate funding agreements directly to the trustees of municipal bond proceeds, money market funds, bank trust departments, and other institutional investors. The segment also issues funding agreements to the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and markets guaranteed investment contracts (“GICs”) to 401(k) and other qualified retirement savings plans. GICs are contracts which specify a return on funds for a specified period and often provide flexibility for withdrawals at book value in keeping with the benefits provided by the plan. The demand for GICs is related to the relative attractiveness of the “fixed rate” investment option in a 401(k) plan compared to the equity-based investment options which may be available to plan participants. The Company also has an unregistered funding agreement-backed notes program which provides for offers of notes to both domestic and international institutional investors. Most GICs and funding agreements the Company has written have maturities of one to twelve years.

Asset Protection
The Asset Protection segment markets extended service contracts, credit life and disability insurance, and other specialized ancillary products to protect consumers’ investments in automobiles, recreational vehicles, watercraft, and powersports. In addition, the segment markets a guaranteed asset protection (“GAP”) product. GAP products are designed to cover the difference between the scheduled loan pay-off amount and an asset’s actual cash value in the case of a total loss. Each type of specialized ancillary product protects against damage or other loss to a particular aspect of the underlying asset. The segment’s products are primarily marketed through a national network of approximately 8,500 automobile, marine, RV, and powersports dealers. A network of direct employee sales representatives and general agents distribute these products to the dealer market.
The following table presents the insurance and related product sales measured by the amount of single premiums and fees received:

Successor Company 
For The Year Ended December 31, | Sales

2018 | $ | 482

In 2018, all of the segment’s sales were through the automobile, RV, marine, and powersports dealer distribution channel and approximately 83.7% of the segment’s sales were extended service contracts. A portion of the sales and resulting premiums are reinsured with producer-affiliated reinsurers.
Corporate and Other
The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of net investment income on assets supporting our equity capital, unallocated corporate overhead, and expenses not attributable to the segments above (including interest on corporate debt). This segment includes earnings from several non-strategic or runoff lines of business, financing and investment related transactions, and the operations of several small subsidiaries. The results of this segment may fluctuate from year to year.

Investments
As of December 31, 2018 (Successor Company), the Company’s investment portfolio was approximately $66.1 billion. The types of assets in which the Company may invest are influenced by various state insurance laws which prescribe qualified investment assets. Within the parameters of these laws, the Company invests in assets giving consideration to such factors as liquidity and capital needs, investment quality, investment return, matching of assets and liabilities, and the overall composition of the investment portfolio by asset type and credit exposure. On February 1, 2015, immediately before the Merger, the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio was significantly above the carrying value primarily due to low market interest rates. As a result of purchase accounting applied as of February 1, 2015, the carrying value of the Company’s investment portfolio was adjusted to fair value which resulted in a drop in the overall yield of the Company’s investment portfolio for the successor period. For further information regarding the Company’s investments, the maturity of and the concentration of risk among the Company’s invested assets, derivative financial instruments, and liquidity, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5, Investment Operations, and Note 7, Derivative Financial Instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Mortgage Loans
The Company invests a portion of its investment portfolio in commercial mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2018 (Successor Company), the Company’s mortgage loan holdings were approximately $7.7 billion. The Company has specialized in making loans on credit-oriented commercial properties, credit-anchored strip shopping centers, senior living facilities, and apartments. The Company’s underwriting procedures relative to its commercial loan portfolio are based, in the Company’s view, on a conservative and disciplined approach. The Company concentrates on a small number of commercial real estate asset types associated with the necessities of life (retail, multi-family, senior living, professional office buildings, and warehouses). The Company believes these asset types tend to weather economic downturns better than other commercial asset classes in which it has chosen not to participate. The Company believes this disciplined approach has helped to maintain a relatively low delinquency and foreclosure rate throughout its history. The majority of the Company’s mortgage loan portfolio was underwritten and funded by the Company. From time to time, the Company may acquire loans in conjunction with an acquisition.

Ratings
Various Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (“rating organizations”) review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. These ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in an insurer’s products, its ability to market its products and its competitive position. The following table summarizes the current financial strength ratings of our significant member companies from the major independent rating organizations:

Ratings | A.M. Best | Fitch | Standard &Poor’s | Moody’s
Insurance company financial strength rating: | | | | 
Protective Life Insurance Company | A+ | A+ | AA- | A1 
West Coast Life Insurance Company | A+ | A+ | AA- | A1 
Protective Life and Annuity Insurance Company | A+ | A+ | AA- | — 
Protective Property & Casualty Insurance Company | A | — | — | — 
MONY Life Insurance Company | A+ | A+ | A+ | A1 

The Company’s ratings are subject to review and change by the rating organizations at any time and without notice. A downgrade or other negative action by a ratings organization with respect to the financial strength ratings of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect sales, relationships with distributors, the level of policy surrenders and withdrawals, the Company’s acquisitions strategy or competitive position in the marketplace, and the cost or availability of reinsurance. The rating agencies may take various actions, positive or negative, with respect to the financial strength ratings of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries, including as a result of the Company’s status as a subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life.
Rating organizations also publish credit ratings for the issuers of debt securities, including the Company. Credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. These ratings are important in the debt issuer’s overall ability to access credit markets and other types of liquidity. Ratings are not recommendations to buy the Company’s securities or products. A downgrade or other negative action by a ratings organization with respect to our credit rating could limit the Company’s access to capital markets, increase the cost of issuing debt, and a downgrade of sufficient magnitude, combined with other negative factors, could require the Company to post collateral. The rating organizations may take various actions, positive or negative, with respect to the Company’s debt ratings.

Underwriting
The underwriting policies of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are established by management. With respect to individual insurance, the subsidiaries use information from the application, and in some cases, third party medical information providers, inspection reports, credit reports, motor vehicle records, previous underwriting records, attending physician statements and/or the results of a medical exam, to determine whether a policy should be issued as applied for, other than applied for, or rejected. Substandard risks may be referred to reinsurers for evaluation. The Company does utilize a “simplified issue” approach for certain policies. In the case of “simplified issue” policies, coverage is rejected if the responses to certain health questions contained in the application, or the applicant’s inability to make an unqualified health certification, indicate adverse health of the applicant. 
The Company’s insurance subsidiaries generally require blood samples to be drawn with individual insurance applications above certain face amounts based on the applicant’s age. Blood samples are tested for a wide range of chemical values and are screened for antibodies to certain viruses. Applications also contain questions permitted by law regarding certain viruses which must be answered by the proposed insureds. 
The Company utilizes an advanced underwriting system, TeleLife®, for certain product lines in its life business. TeleLife® streamlines the application process through a telephonic interview of the applicant, schedules medical exams, accelerates the underwriting process and the ultimate issuance of a policy mostly through electronic means. The Company also introduced a streamlined underwriting approach that utilizes the TeleLife® process and noninvasive risk selection tools to approve some applications without requiring a paramedical exam or lab testing. 
The Company’s maximum retention limit on directly issued business is $5,000,000 for any one life on certain of its traditional life and universal life products.
Reinsurance Ceded
The Company’s insurance subsidiaries cede life insurance to other insurance companies. The ceding insurance company remains liable with respect to ceded insurance should any reinsurer fail to meet the obligations assumed by it. 
For approximately 10 years prior to mid-2005, the Company entered into reinsurance contracts in which the Company ceded approximately 90% of its newly-written traditional life insurance business on a first dollar quota share basis under coinsurance contracts. In mid-2005, the Company substantially discontinued coinsuring its newly written traditional life insurance and moved to yearly renewable term (“YRT”) reinsurance. The amount of insurance retained by the Company on any one life on traditional life insurance was $500,000 in years prior to mid-2005. In 2005, this retention amount was increased to $1,000,000 for certain policies, and during 2008, was increased to $2,000,000 for certain policies. During 2016, the retention amount was increased to $5,000,000.
For approximately 15 years prior to 2012, the Company reinsured 90% of the mortality risk on the majority of its newly written universal life insurance on a YRT basis. During 2012, the Company moved to reinsure only amounts in excess of its $2,000,000 retention, which was increased to $5,000,000 during 2016, for the majority of its newly written universal life and level premium term insurance.
10

Policy Liabilities and Accruals
The applicable insurance laws under which the Company’s insurance subsidiaries operate require that each insurance company report policy liabilities to meet future obligations on the outstanding policies. These liabilities are calculated in accordance with applicable law. These liabilities along with additional premiums to be received and the compounded interest earned on those premiums are considered to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the liabilities shall not be less than liabilities calculated using certain named mortality tables and interest rates.
The policy liabilities and accruals carried in the Company’s financial reports presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and carried in the insurance subsidiaries’ statutory financial statements (presented on the basis of statutory accounting principles mandated by state insurance regulations). For policy liabilities for traditional life, immediate annuity, and health contracts, these differences arise from the use of mortality and morbidity tables and interest rate assumptions which are deemed to be more appropriate for financial reporting purposes than those required for statutory accounting purposes. The GAAP policy liabilities also include lapse assumptions in the calculation and use the net level premium method on all business which generally differs from policy liabilities calculated for statutory financial statements. Policy liabilities for universal life policies, deferred annuity contracts, GICs, and funding agreements are generally carried in the Company’s financial reports at the account value of the policy or contract plus accrued interest. Additional liabilities are held as appropriate for excess benefits above the account value.
Federal Taxes
In general, existing law generally exempts policyholders from current taxation on an increase in the value of their life insurance and annuity products during these products’ accumulation phase. This favorable tax treatment gives certain of the Company’s products a competitive advantage over investment products. If tax laws are revised such that there is an elimination or scale-back of this favorable tax treatment, or competing investment products are granted similar tax treatment, then the relative attractiveness of the Company’s products may be reduced or eliminated.
The Company is subject to corporate income, excise, franchise, and premium taxes. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) was enacted. It significantly changed U.S. tax law. For example, it lowered the corporate income tax rate, beginning in 2018. This resulted in a decrease in the Company’s effective tax rate. The Tax Reform Act increases the Company’s taxable income, as a result of changes regarding policy acquisition costs and policyholder benefit reserves. While overall the Tax Reform Act will cause the Company to report higher amounts of taxable income, the Company expects to pay less future income taxes due to the lower tax rate.
In addition, life insurance products are often used to fund estate tax obligations. Recent and possibly future changes to estate tax law may affect the demand for life insurance products.
The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are generally taxed in the same manner as are other companies in the industry. Certain tax law restrictions prevent the immediate inclusion of recently-acquired life insurance companies in the Company’s consolidated income tax return. Additionally, these restrictions limit the amount of life insurance income that can be offset by non-life-insurance losses. Overall, these restrictions may cause the Company’s effective tax rate to increase.
The Company’s decreased reliance on reinsurance for newly written traditional life products resulted in a reduction in the taxes which the Company currently pays, offset by an increase in its deferred taxes. The Company allocates the benefits of reduced current taxes to the Life Marketing and Acquisition segments. The profitability and competitive position of certain of the Company products are dependent on the continuation of certain tax benefits which are provided by current tax law and the Company’s ability to generate future taxable income.
Competition
Life and health insurance is a mature and highly competitive industry. In recent years, the industry’s life insurance sales have been relatively flat, though the aging population has increased the demand for retirement savings products. The Company encounters significant competition in all lines of business, including in the Acquisitions segment. 
The Company encounters competition for sales of life insurance and retirement products from other insurance companies, many of which have greater financial resources than the Company and which may have a greater market share, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower operating or financing costs, or have lower profitability expectations. The Company also faces competition from other providers of financial services. Competition could result in, among other things, lower sales or higher lapses of existing products.
The Company’s ability to compete is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to attract and retain distributors to market its insurance and investment products, its ability to develop competitive and profitable products, its ability to maintain low unit costs, and its maintenance of adequate ratings from rating organizations.
As technology evolves, a comparison of a particular product of any company for a particular customer with competing products for that customer is more readily available, which could lead to increased competition as well as agent or customer behavior, including persistency, which differs from past behavior.

The Company encounters competition in its Acquisitions segment from other insurance companies as well as from other types of acquirers, including private equity investors. Many of these competitors may have greater financial resources than the Company and may be willing to assume a greater level of risk, have lower operating or financing costs, or have lower profitability expectations.
Risk Management
Risk management is a critical part of the Company’s business, and the Company has adopted risk management processes in multiple aspects of its operations, including product development and management, business acquisitions, underwriting, investment management, asset-liability management, hedging, and technology. The Company’s Enterprise Risk Management office, under the direction of the Chief Risk Officer, along with other departments, management groups and committees, have responsibilities for managing different risks throughout the Company. Risk management includes the assessment of risk, a decision process which includes determining which risks are acceptable and the monitoring and management of identified risks on an ongoing basis. The primary objectives of these risk management processes are to determine the acceptable level of variations the Company experiences from its expected results and to implement strategies designed to limit such variations to these levels.
Regulation
State Regulation
The Company is subject to government regulation in each of the states in which it conducts business. In many instances, the regulatory models emanate from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). Such regulation is vested in state agencies having broad administrative and in some instances discretionary power dealing with many aspects of the Company’s business, which may include, among other things, premium and cost of insurance rates and increases thereto, interest crediting policy, underwriting practices, reserve requirements, marketing practices, advertising, privacy, data security, cybersecurity, policy forms, reinsurance reserve requirements, insurer use of captive reinsurance companies, acquisitions, mergers, capital adequacy, claims practices and the remittance of unclaimed property. In addition, some state insurance departments may enact rules or regulations with extra-territorial application, effectively extending their jurisdiction to areas such as permitted insurance company investments that are normally the province of an insurance company’s domiciliary state regulator.
The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are required to file periodic reports with the regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which they do business, and their business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time. Under the rules of the NAIC, insurance companies are examined periodically (generally every three to five years) by one or more of the regulatory agencies on behalf of the states in which they do business. At any given time, a number of financial and/or market conduct examinations of the Company’s subsidiaries may be ongoing. From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations or audits for the Company’s subsidiaries that could, if determined adversely, have a material adverse impact on the Company. To date, no such insurance department examinations have produced any significant adverse findings regarding any of the Company’s insurance company subsidiaries.
Under the insurance guaranty fund laws in most states, insurance companies doing business in the state can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent companies. From time to time, companies may be asked to contribute amounts beyond prescribed limits. It is possible that the Company could be assessed with respect to product lines not offered by the Company. In addition, legislation may be introduced in various states with respect to guaranty fund assessment laws related to insurance products, including long-term care insurance and other specialty products, that increases the cost of future assessments or alters future premium tax offsets received in connection with guaranty fund assessments. The Company cannot predict the amount, nature or timing of any future assessments or legislation, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, many states, including the states in which the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, have enacted legislation or adopted regulations regarding insurance holding company systems. These laws require registration of and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within the jurisdiction which control or are controlled by other corporations or persons so as to constitute an insurance holding company system. These laws also affect the acquisition of control of insurance companies as well as transactions between insurance companies and companies controlling them. Most states, including Tennessee, where PLICO is domiciled, require administrative approval of the acquisition of control of an insurance company domiciled in the state or the acquisition of control of an insurance holding company whose insurance subsidiary is incorporated in the state. In Tennessee, the acquisition of 10% of the voting securities of an entity is deemed to be the acquisition of control for the purpose of the insurance holding company statute and requires not only the filing of detailed information concerning the acquiring parties and the plan of acquisition, but also administrative approval prior to the acquisition. Holding company legislation has been adopted in certain states where the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which subjects the subsidiaries to increased reporting requirements. Holding company legislation has also been proposed in additional states, which, if adopted, will subject any domiciled subsidiaries to additional reporting and supervision requirements.
The states in which the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled also impose certain restrictions on the subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends to the Company. These restrictions are based in part on the prior year’s statutory income and surplus. In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered ordinary and may be paid without prior approval. Dividends in larger amounts are considered extraordinary and are subject to affirmative prior approval by the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile. The maximum amount that would qualify as ordinary dividends to the Company by its insurance subsidiaries in 2019 is approximately, in the aggregate, $434.0 million. No assurance can be given that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled; such restrictions could have the effect, under certain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to the Company by such subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities.
12

State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer and may lead to additional expense for the insurer. Furthermore, some NAIC pronouncements, particularly as they affect accounting issues, take effect automatically in various states without affirmative action by those states. 
The NAIC is considering revisions to the Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation which, if adopted by regulators, could impose a stricter standard of care upon insurers who sell annuities. Likewise, several states are considering or have adopted legislation or regulatory measures that would implement new requirements and standards applicable to the sale of annuities and, in some cases, life insurance products. The NAIC and several states, including Connecticut, Nevada, New Jersey, and New York have passed laws or proposed regulations requiring insurers, investment advisers, broker-dealers, and/or agents to disclose conflicts of interest to clients or to meet standards that their advice be in the customer’s best interest. These standards vary widely in scope, applicability, and timing of implementation. The adoption and enactment of these or any revised standards as law or regulation could have a material adverse effect upon the manner in which the Company’s products are sold and impact the overall market for such products.
Federal Regulation
At the federal level, the executive branch or federal agencies may issue orders or take other action with respect to financial services and life insurance matters, and bills are routinely introduced in both chambers of the United States Congress which could affect the Company’s business. In the past, Congress has considered legislation that would impact insurance companies in numerous ways, such as providing for an optional federal charter or a federal presence for insurance, preempting state law in certain respects regarding the regulation of reinsurance, increasing federal oversight in areas such as consumer protection and solvency regulation, setting tax rates, and other matters. The Company cannot predict whether or in what form legislation will be enacted and, if so, the impact of such legislation on the Company.
The Company is also subject to various conditions and requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the "Healthcare Act"). The Healthcare Act makes significant changes to the regulation of health insurance and may affect the Company in various ways, including by potentially treating small blocks of business the Company has offered or acquired over the years as health insurance, as well as by potentially affecting the benefit plans the Company sponsors for employees or retirees and their dependents and the Company’s expenses and tax liabilities related to the provision of such benefits. In addition, the Company may be subject to regulations, guidance or determinations emanating from the various regulatory authorities authorized under the Healthcare Act, all of which could have a significant impact on the Company.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“the Dodd-Frank Act”) made sweeping changes to the regulation of financial services entities, products and markets. The Dodd-Frank Act directed existing and newly-created government agencies and bodies to perform studies and promulgate a multitude of regulations implementing the law, a process that has substantially advanced but is not yet complete. Although the current presidential administration has indicated a desire to revise or reverse some of its provisions, the fate of these proposals is unclear, and we cannot predict with certainty how the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to affect the financial markets generally, or impact our business, ratings, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act imposed a comprehensive new regulatory regime on the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives marketplace and granted new joint regulatory authority to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) over OTC derivatives. In collaboration with U.S. federal banking regulators, the CFTC has adopted regulations which categorize the Company as a “financial end-user” which is thereby required to post and collect margin in a variety of derivatives transactions. Recommendations and reports from entities created under the Dodd-Frank Act, such as the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), could also affect the manner in which insurance and reinsurance are regulated in the U.S. and, thereby, the Company’s business. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), an independent division of the Department of Treasury with jurisdiction over credit, savings, payment, and other consumer financial products and services, other than investment products already regulated by the SEC or the CFTC. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries sell products that may be regulated by the CFPB, and the Company is unable to predict at this time the ways in which the CFPB’s regulations might directly or indirectly affect the Company or its subsidiaries.
Sales of life insurance policies and annuity contracts offered by the Company are subject to regulations relating to sales practices adopted by a variety of federal and state regulatory authorities. Certain annuities and life insurance policies such as variable annuities and variable universal life insurance are regulated under the federal securities laws administered by the SEC. On April 18, 2018, the SEC voted to propose rulemakings and interpretations relating to the standard of conduct applicable to broker-dealers, investment advisers, and their representatives when making certain recommendations to retail customers. Specifically, under the proposed regulations, a broker-dealer would be required to act in the best interest of a retail customer when recommending any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities to a retail customer. The SEC also proposed an interpretation reaffirming and, in some cases, clarifying its views of the fiduciary duty that investment advisers owe to their clients. Another SEC proposal would require broker-dealers and investment advisers to provide each customer with a summary of the nature of the customer’s relationship with the investment professional, as well as a restriction on the use of the terms “adviser” and “advisor” by broker-dealers. The comment period on the proposals closed on August 7, 2018. The SEC has indicated that it will issue a final version of the regulations and the interpretation before the end of the third quarter 2019. 
In addition, broker-dealers, insurance agencies and other financial institutions sell the Company’s annuities to employee benefit plans governed by provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) and Individual Retirement Accounts that are governed by similar provisions under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). Consequently, our activities and 
13

those of the firms that sell the Company’s products are subject to restrictions that require ERISA fiduciaries to perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and that prohibit ERISA fiduciaries from causing a covered plan or retirement account to engage in certain prohibited transactions absent an exemption.
There remains significant uncertainty surrounding the final form that these regulations may take. Our current distributors may continue to move forward with their plans to limit the number of products they offer, including the types of products offered by the Company. The Company may find it necessary to change sales representative and/or broker compensation, to limit the assistance or advice it can provide to owners of the Company’s annuities, to replace or engage additional distributors, or otherwise change the manner in which it designs, supervises, and supports sales of its annuities and, where applicable, life insurance products. In addition, the Company continues to incur expenses in connection with initial and ongoing compliance obligations with respect to such rules, and in the aggregate these expenses may be significant. Any of the foregoing regulatory, legislative, or judicial measures or the reaction to such activity by consumers or other members of the insurance industry could have a material adverse impact on our ability to sell annuities and other products, to retain in-force business, and on our financial condition or results of operations. 
Certain life insurance policies, contracts, and annuities offered by the Company are subject to regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the SEC. The federal securities laws contain regulatory restrictions and criminal, administrative, and private remedial provisions. From time to time, the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) examine or investigate the activities of broker-dealers and investment advisers, including the Company’s affiliated broker-dealers and investment advisers. These examinations or investigations often focus on the activities of the registered representatives and registered investment advisers doing business through such entities and the entities’ supervision of those persons.
The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 includes anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws as well as various regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. Financial institutions are required to collect information regarding the identity of their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies and share information with other financial institutions. As a result, the Company is required to maintain certain internal compliance practices, procedures, and controls.
Cyber Security Regulation
In response to the growing threat of cyber attacks in the insurance industry, certain jurisdictions have begun to consider new cybersecurity measures, including the adoption of cybersecurity regulations that, among other things, would require insurance companies to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program and implement and maintain cybersecurity policies and procedures. On October 24, 2017, the NAIC adopted its Insurance Data Security Model Law (the “NAIC Model Law”), which is intended to serve as model legislation for states to enact in order to govern cybersecurity and data protection practices of insurers, insurance agents, and other licensed entities registered under state insurance laws. To date, South Carolina, Michigan, and Ohio have adopted cybersecurity regulations that are based, at least in part, on the NAIC’s Model Law, and several other states have pending or are considering adopting regulations based on the NAIC Model Law. Additionally, the New York Department of Financial Services (“DFS”) issued regulations governing cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies, which became effective in March 2017. The DFS regulations require insurance companies, among others, licensed in New York to assess their specific cyber risk profiles and design cybersecurity programs to address such risks, as well as file annually with DFS a program compliance certification pertaining to their compliance with DFS cybersecurity requirements. The Company continues to monitor whether the other states in which it conducts business, as well as federal governmental agencies, adopt data security laws. 
The Company has implemented information security policies that are designed to address the security of the Company’s information assets, which include personally identifiable information (“PII”) and protected health information (“PHI”), as well as other proprietary and confidential information about the Company, its employees, customers, agents, and business partners. Additionally, the Company has an information risk management committee that, among other things, reviews emerging risks and monitors regulatory requirements and industry standards relating to the security of the Company’s information assets, monitors the Company’s cybersecurity initiatives, and approves the Company’s cyber incident response plans. This committee meets regularly, and the Board of Directors receives reports regarding cybersecurity matters. Furthermore, as part of the Company’s information security program, the Company has included security features in its systems that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of the Company’s information assets, including PII and PHI. Notwithstanding these efforts, cyber threats and related legal and regulatory standards applicable to the insurance industry are rapidly evolving, and the Company’s and the Company’s business partners’ and service providers’ systems may continue to be vulnerable to security breaches, viruses, programming errors, and other similar disruptive problems or incidents. Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations, reputation, customer relationships, and financial condition.
Other Regulation    
Other types of regulation that could affect the Company and its subsidiaries include insurance company investment laws and regulations, state statutory accounting practices, tax laws, antitrust laws, minimum solvency requirements, enterprise risk requirements, state securities laws, federal privacy laws, technology and data regulations, insurable interest laws, federal anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, employment and immigration laws and, because the Company owns and operates real property, state, federal, and local environmental laws. The Company may also be subject to regulations influenced by or related to international regulatory authorities or initiatives. The Company’s sole stockholder, Dai-ichi Life, is subject to regulation by the Japanese Financial Services Authority (“JFSA”). Under applicable laws and regulations, Dai-ichi Life is required to provide notice to or obtain the consent of the JFSA prior to taking certain actions or engaging in certain transactions, either directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries, including the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Domestically, the NAIC may be influenced by 
14

the initiatives or regulatory structures or schemes of international regulatory bodies, and those initiatives or regulatory structures or schemes may not translate readily into the regulatory structures or schemes of the legal system (including the interpretation or application of standards by juries) under which U.S. insurers must operate. Changes in laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof, or to initiatives or regulatory structures or schemes of international regulatory bodies, which are applicable to the Company could have a significant adverse impact on the Company.
Additional issues related to regulation of the Company and its insurance subsidiaries are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included herein.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 2,957 employees, of which 2,948 were full-time and 9 were part-time employees. Included in the total were approximately 1,568 employees in Birmingham, Alabama, of which 1,562 were full-time and 6 were part-time employees. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a union and the Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes its relations with its employees are satisfactory. Most employees are covered by contributory major medical, dental, vision, group life, and long-term disability insurance plans. The cost of these benefits to the Company in 2018 was approximately $17.8 million. In addition, substantially all of the employees may participate in a defined benefit pension plan and 401(k) plan. The Company matches employee contributions to its 401(k) plan. See Note 16, Employee Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Intellectual Property 
The Company relies on a combination of intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and policies, and contractual provisions to protect its brand and its intellectual property, which includes copyrights, trademarks, patents, domain names, and trade secrets. The success of the Company’s business depends on its continued ability to use and protect its intellectual property, including its trademark and service mark portfolio which is composed of both United States registered and common law trademarks and service marks, including the Company’s Protective name and logo. The Company’s intellectual property assets are valuable to the Company in maintaining its brand and marketing its products; thus, the Company maintains and protects its intellectual property assets from infringement and dilution.
