ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General
 
Clearday is a non-acute health care services company focused on servicing the largest demographic in the country – older Americans, who we define as adults that are 50 or more years of age. Clearday provides a modern, hopeful vision for making high-quality care more accessible, affordable, and empowering for older Americans and those who love and care for them. We operate four residential care facilities and a day care center that serve primarily older Americans, and persons facing cognitive issues such as Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. These facilities are our centers of cognitive excellence in which we have developed new care models that improve the experiences of our customers, their families and our care givers.
 
We expect to disrupt the traditional long-term care model by providing:
 

● | Innovative care products and service solutions that serve older Americans, their families and their caregivers, primarily through our digital service Clearday at HomeTM, which provides an innovative, tech-enabled platform that makes high-quality care more accessible, affordable, and empowering; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A membership-based adult day care model under our Clearday Clubs brand that will provide high-quality, daytime-only care primarily for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, other dementias, or other lifestyle-limiting chronic health conditions; 
● | Continuing our memory care facilities that focus on treating residents suffering from any of 25 diagnoses of dementia (including Alzheimer’s disease) which may require 24/7 care and be treated in a residential care facility and continuing to develop therapies and services that enhance the quality of life for our residents and their families; and 
● | Continuing to develop and market innovative care and wellness solutions through Clearday Labs. 

 
Clearday focuses on expanding the traditional continuum of care to develop and provide a complete care spectrum. The traditional continuum of care often focuses predominately on different types of residential communities (brick and mortar). Our complete care spectrum focuses on allowing people to age in the right place, which may be their home, a daily care center or a residential community.


Based on certain generally available industry publications and surveys, Clearday believes that the older American segment currently represents approximately 45% of the U.S. consumer market and estimates that, subject to the disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the spending power of U.S. consumers over 60 years old will be approximately $7.6 trillion annually, a figure that Clearday believes will likely grow significantly as age demographics continue to shift to longer lifespans. Clearday believes that every day approximately 10,000 Americans turn 65 and that this trend will continue for decades. Certain studies expect that the number of Americans aged 65 and over will nearly double from 52 million in 2018 to 95 million in 2060. All of these consumers will need care as they grow older, and Clearday believes its portfolio of traditional, alternative, and technology-enabled businesses is aligned to address the diverse needs of these older Americans and their caregivers.
 
Clearday believes that:
 

● | The U.S. older care market has more than 110 million Americans and is growing; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Approximately 16 million Americans provide unpaid care for people with Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia, which represents a significant number of people that could enter or return to the paid work force if alternatives such as affordable adult day care were available; 
● | Approximately, 7.2 million Americans today live with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia, and it is expected that over the next 20 years, the total number of those living with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia in the U.S. is expected to approximately double from 7.2 million to nearly 13 million, with 8.5 million women and 4.5 million men; 
● | More than 75% of the help provided to older adults in the United States is provided by family members, friends or other unpaid caregivers; and 
● | That there is a significant labor shortage in the U.S. for older care that supports the development of innovative care solutions.

Innovation by Leveraging Technologies
 
Clearday intends to pursue businesses that are focused on the older care consumer market. Clearday evaluated changes to traditional care businesses to meet the consumer demand with innovative technologies, including in a manner that protects its customers from infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Clearday has developed each of our innovative businesses with the intent to leverage technology and will continue business development to address changing consumer preferences and regulatory requirements, including adding to the adult day care business a virtual service that provides many of the core benefits to the older Americans that would participate as a member of a Clearday Club. The products and services that are described below may be modified by Clearday as part of its continuing business strategy to provide a full care spectrum to older Americans that we believe will enhance their lives at a cost that is significantly lower than many competitors that historically service this market with traditional (residential care) services.
 
One indicator of Clearday’s ability to leverage technologies is our development during Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 of our proprietary B.E.S.T. test that provides an evaluation of a person’s (1) Behavior, (2) level of Engagement, and factors that indicate issues with such person’s level of (3) Stimulation and (4) Temperament or interaction with others. The B.E.S.T. test enables Clearday to develop a customized plan of care for the individual. The plan of care is implemented by the individual’s care givers such as family members or skilled professionals including CNAs. At regular intervals, the B.E.S.T. test is again administered, and the individual’s plan of care is modified to the extent necessary.
 
Clearday at Home
 
Clearday at Home is a unique digital service offering to the multi-billion home care industry with proprietary modern, innovative care products and services, with the goal of enabling seniors to stay in their homes longer and delay the need for residential care. Clearday launched its virtual offering of in-home care services through a digital network that makes a senior’s day more healthy, social and uplifting. The Clearday at Home service is a scalable, economic and effective platform that may reach the older American market. Clearday at Home connects the senior and their loved ones to others with similar experiences and challenges with proprietary programing that includes a range of activities, including physical and mental exercises to improve individuals that are challenged by dementia or other cognitive issues. Some of these programs are coordinated with the client’s at home care giver and greatly assist integrated plans of care. Such products and services are expected to be integrated with Clearday Clubs and other Clearday businesses.
 
Clearday believes that the care spectrum will be significantly improved by providing a home health option that integrates with a broader range of care offerings. Clearday plans to improve the traditional home health care model with technologies and superior point of care service.
 
Clearday believes that its business model provides superior client attention and service experience for the informal family caregivers of senior citizens, who often are the primary point of contact for coordinating care services. Clearday’s tech-enabled care model is planned to coordinate a range of care, health and wellness issues that are often not given significant attention or provided in a unified and coordinated model. Clearday at Home may be integrated with our facilities, such as adult day care and specialty clinics, to provide a broader, more flexible assortment services to this market segment.
 
Residential Memory Care
 
The residential care businesses have been conducted by Clearday and its predecessors for a significant period through our subsidiaries, referred to collectively as “MCA”. The residential care communities are facilities that have been built to suit using architecture, designs and furniture that elevate the residential care of persons suffering from dementia or other cognitive issues. There are 26 diagnoses of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. 25 of these diagnoses may be treated in a community setting and our residential care communities treat each of these 25 diagnoses. Our residential communities operate in three U.S. states. We believe that our facilities are a leader in memory care, in part because during 2021 the facilities had a below industry average adverse behavior incidents and protected residents from the COVID-19 virus as evidenced by that fact that the number of our residents that were hospitalized because of COVID-19 was below the industry average and there have not been any resident deaths directly caused by this virus to March 31, 2022. Clearday’s MCA executives have decades of experience in the cognitive residential care treatment, including policies and procedures that protect older Americans. Our residential care communities provide us with a proprietary and extensive understanding of the non-acute care and wellness industry and serve as our foundation for innovative care solutions, including the use of Clearday Restore, a proprietary, innovative, multi-sensory therapy tailored to the needs of those with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia or cognitive challenges that has contributed to decreased adverse incidents, and robotics.

Adult Day Care—Clearday Clubs
 
We acquired an adult daycare center in San Antonio, Texas in May, 2021, and plan to develop our Clearday Club adult daycare at our San Antonio headquarters building and develop a network of local, membership-based centers, which will provide to the older care market a high-standard, technology-enabled care option that is significantly less expensive than long-term residential care alternatives. Our Clearday Clubs adult daycare will offer services through a monthly subscription and be characterized by welcoming facilities, trained staff, and personalized care programs that may be tailored to individual member needs. Each of the Clearday Clubs will utilize the proprietary format and programs, enabling Clearday to quickly and efficiently roll out or expand its Clearday Clubs at an efficient standard cost per center.
 
The Clearday Clubs is positioned by us to be an integral part of Clearday building the complete care spectrum for older Americans that enable people to stay in their homes longer and conserve their savings. Clearday believes that the adult day care centers will be able to provide many of the full-day residential care services at a fraction of the cost. Clearday believes that current adult day care market participants include many smaller local businesses that do not provide the level of technology-enabled care, proven programming, and best practices expertise that will be provided by Clearday.
 
Clearday Labs
 
Clearday Labs is a focus group of Clearday senior executives and advisors supported by a team of technology consultants. We have developed Clearday Labs to continue to identify and develop modern innovative products and services to support older Americans Age in the Right Place. The Clearday Lab initiatives include the following:

● | Clearday Therapeutic streams, our proprietary service that provides guidance to care givers as to specific issues such as assisting with activities of daily living, for example sundowning; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Robotic services through our strategic alliance with Invento Research, that delivers our proprietary Clearday at Home digital services and enhances safety, security and engagement; and 
● | Clearday Cutting Edge Rooms that enhance the experience of a resident with our proprietary therapies and technology; 
● | A cryogenic air quality system that removes particulates and volatile organics (which effectively sterilizes the internal atmosphere), reduces CO2 (carbon dioxide), and regulates humidity, by condensing or freezing the air in interior built spaces in a system that can easily integrate with HVAC systems. 
● | Clearday Network, a subscription service that helps agencies recruit and retain caregivers and enhance client experiences and provides support and backbone to Clearday services that are aligned with the “healthcare at home” movement. Clearday Network launched in November, 2021 and provides Clearday’s proprietary BEST Test content to provide a Digital Care Map that is personalized and supports both the family caregiver plus additional training to the professional caregiver; 

 
We expect to use Clearday Labs to continue to develop products and services targeted to the health and homecare markets, including through strategic alliances that are expected to be structured to lower our development costs to bring new products and services to market.
 
Our Strategy
 
Clearday’s mission is to be a leading provider to the older care consumer market by providing more engaging and more affordable alternatives that will:
 

● | Allow people to Age in the Right Place; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Leverage technology to enhance the customer experience and quality of product and service offerings, with a lower cost structure than is possible for legacy care service providers; 
● | Require less capital investment than traditional residential care facilities and other customary care services offerings targeted to older Americans; and 
● | Provide exemplary care to older Americans facing dementia and other lifestyle-limiting physical and cognitive issues. 

 
Clearday’s digital service strategy is initially focused on the initial launch and rapid expansion of Clearday at Home service. Clearday intends to continue the use of our digital service in our communities and acquire other customers through a B2B (business to business) strategy, primarily by teaming with home care agencies and long-term care facilities, which permits such agencies to resell Clearday at Home services and offer an advantage over other agencies by providing a more engaging and beneficial service to home care consumers.


Clearday also plans to expand its Clearday Club services. Clearday acquired an adult day care center that is located in San Antonio, Texas that primarily serves veterans who receive reimbursement from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Clearday is rebranding this adult day care center and expects it will continue to focus on members that are Veterans who receive VA reimbursement. Clearday plans to expand their number of Clearday Club locations in the near future and may also selectively acquire adult day care centers that are local and continue its business or revitalize such adult day care center and rebrand it as a Clearday Club. Clearday expects to locate its adult day care facilities near employment hubs or medical service communities, such as medical offices, hospitals or other traditional and alternative patient care facilities permitting close proximity for easy “drop off” and “pick up” and coordinated care by its client’s medical and other care professionals. Clearday believes that employers who have adopted and promoted the growth of childcare service options with employee support and benefit subsidies may support and subsidize adult day care in a similar fashion.
 
Clearday expects that most of its growth of its adult day care centers will be through proprietary centers that are developed by Clearday. Clearday may also selectively acquire adult day care centers that are local and continue its business or revitalize such adult day care center and rebrand it as a Clearday Club.
 
Clearday markets and distributes its products and services through its own sales and marketing staff as well as through on-line and e-commerce. Our innovative care services are distributed primarily through a business to businesses marketing strategy.

Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that one of our competitive advantages is our almost two decades of knowledge of the older care market, as well as our ability to apply this understanding consistently across a diverse array of care delivery channels. Clearday believes that our competitive strengths include that:

● | Our executive management has extensive experience in operating long-term care assets with decades of knowledge in real estate, regulatory matters, and delivering care to customers and their families . 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | We are able to offer a more diverse, flexible, and affordable care spectrum 
● | We may expand our real estate centric business without the burden of existing lease and facilities costs, enabling us to take advantage of significant opportunities created in the long-term care market by the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges; 
● | We have a proprietary design for the build out of leased space to promote a consistent look, feel, and service experience within its Clearday Clubs; 
● | We have an effective sales and marketing program led by a local San Antonio team that has already sold adult day care center services prior to the opening of any of the Clearday Clubs, which services are delivered at an affiliated residential care facility. 


● | Our residential care facilities are well positioned in geographic markets with consistent growing demand; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Opportunity Zone Fund
 
Clearday sponsored an opportunity fund that provided investors with the ability to utilize the significant tax advantages of investing in designated “qualified opportunity zones,” within the meaning of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This sponsored fund acquired a 3-story medical office building located in San Antonio, Texas 78217 that is located on 0.84 acres and has approximately 22,265 rentable square feet. Clearday intends to use most of the ground floor for an adult day care center and for related businesses including production of virtual programing. Some of the office space will be used for Clearday’s initial medical staff training and educational center that will further develop and offer Clearday’s Technicians of Cognitive Care Program. Space in this building will also be used for Clearday’s corporate headquarters.
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive market. Our residential care facilities compete with numerous other senior living community operators, as well as companies that provide senior living services, such as home healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. Some of Clearday’s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than Clearday and some of Clearday’s competitors are not-for-profit entities that have endowment income and may not face the same financial pressures as Clearday. Also, in recent years, a significant number of new senior living communities have been developed, and Clearday expects this increased development activity to continue in the future. This activity has increased competitive pressures on Clearday, particularly in the geographic markets where Clearday operates its residential care facilities. Additionally, some competitors of Clearday that operate in the same geographic market as some of Clearday’s residential care facilities have renegotiated their facility lease terms which provide a lower cost structure than Clearday. Other participants that enter the longevity residential care market will have a similar cost advantage over Clearday.

The adult day care market is generally a more fragmented market in the locations that Clearday has targeted and generally do not provide the same level of tech enabled care and range of cognitive and relaxation therapies that will be offered by Clearday. There are several larger firms in the adult day care markets that are targeted by Clearday and not for profit entities, as well as a range of alternatives including social centers and religious institutions that provide some, but not all of the services that will be provided by Clearday.
 
Certain of our products and services being developed in our Clearday Labs, including the use of robotic services, also face significant competition, including by companies that may have greater resources, more widely accepted and innovative products and stronger name recognition than we do.
 
Clearday addressed the competition in the home and residential care market by differentiating our facilities by, among other matters, quality of services and use of innovative therapeutic services, including Clearday Restore our digital services and our development of robotic based services.
 
For more information on our competitive pressures that we may face and associated risks, see “Risk Factors”.
 
Government Regulation
 
Residential Care and Adult Day Care Businesses
 
The senior living and healthcare industries are subject to extensive, frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations vary by jurisdiction but may address, among other things, licensure of facilities and personnel, required staffing ratios, the authority to provide various types of medical care, zoning and physical facility requirements, food safety, emergency preparedness plan requirements, medical waste disposal requirements, government healthcare program participation requirements, fraud and abuse prohibitions, requirement relating to reimbursement for services, recordkeeping requirements, resident rights and prohibitions against abuse and neglect, confidentiality and security of personal information. Some states may also require a certificate of need before a community may be opened or the services at an existing community may be expanded. These laws and regulatory requirements impact Clearday’s day-to-day operations could affect Clearday’s ability to expand its facilities-based businesses into new markets and to expand our services and communities in existing markets.
 
There are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals, relationships, and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers, including those in the senior living industry. Governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources to anti-fraud initiatives. Pertaining to Clearday’s provision of services to veterans that are reimbursed through benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the “VA”), Clearday is subject to the federal False Claims Act that prohibits anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented to the government, claims for payment that are false, fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Either the government or a private individual acting on behalf of the government may bring an action under the False Claims Act alleging that a healthcare provider has defrauded the government and seek treble damages for false claims and the payment of additional monetary civil penalties. The False Claims Act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government’s recovery. As a result of these financial incentives, these so-called “whistleblower” suits have become more frequent. Violation of the False Claims Act may also result in loss of licensure, citations, sanctions, and other criminal or civil fines and penalties, the refund of overpayments, payment suspensions, or termination of participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs, which may also trigger default under debt and lease obligations.

Additionally, Clearday is subject the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), and certain state referral laws. The AKS makes it unlawful for any person to offer or pay (or to solicit or receive) “any remuneration... directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind” for referring or recommending for purchase any item or service which is eligible for payment under a federal healthcare program, including VA benefits. A violation of the federal AKS is a felony and may also result in criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from government reimbursement programs, which may also cause default under debt and lease obligations The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has published a number of “safe harbor” regulations that define practices that may technically violate the AKS, but will not be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action. An arrangement that fails to fit within a safe harbor is not necessarily per se illegal; the OIG will evaluate the facts and circumstances of arrangements on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the arrangements involve illegal remuneration by one party to the other. Other than VA benefits, Clearday did not generally receive reimbursement from Medicare or Medicaid or other governmental programs.
 
Clearday’s compliance with many of the laws and regulations cited above is determined by inspection, survey and review by the applicable authority on a periodic or other basis (e.g., complaint-based) as determined from time to time by the applicable authority. Many inspection deficiencies are resolved through a plan of corrective action relating to the facility’s cited deficiencies, but a reviewing agency may have the authority to take further action against a licensed or certified facility that could result in fines, adverse licensure action (suspension, revocation, probation), suspension or denial of admissions, loss of certification as a provider under federal and/or state reimbursement programs, or imposition of other sanctions, including criminal penalties. Challenging and appealing allegations of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations requires the expenditure of significant legal fees and management attention. Any adverse determination concerning any of Clearday’s licenses, permits or eligibility to receive government-based reimbursement, any penalties, repayments or other sanctions, and the increasing costs of required compliance with applicable laws may trigger default under debt or lease obligations, and may negatively affect its financial condition and operations. Also, adverse findings with regard to any single Clearday community may have an adverse impact on Clearday’s ability to obtain or maintain licenses at other locations, and may have a material adverse effect on marketing and Clearday’s reputation. In addition, states’ Attorneys General vigorously enforce consumer protection laws as those laws relate to the senior living industry. State Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Units may also investigate assisted living and memory care communities even if the community or any of its residents do not receive federal or state funds.
 
Clearday’s care businesses must comply with laws designed to protect the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable information. Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, Clearday must comply with rules adopted by HHS governing the privacy, security, use and disclosure of individually identifiable information, including financial information and protected health information, or PHI, and also with security rules for electronic PHI. There may be both civil monetary penalties and criminal sanctions for noncompliance with these laws. Under the HITECH Act, penalties for violation of certain provisions may be as high as $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil penalty of $1.5 million per calendar year. In January 2013, HHS released the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, or the Omnibus Rule, which went into effect in March 2013 and required compliance with most provisions by September 2013. The Omnibus Rule modified various privacy and security requirements, including modifying the standard for providing breach notices. In addition to HIPAA, many states have enacted their own security and privacy laws relating to individually identifiable information, including financial information and health information. In some states, these laws are more burdensome than HIPAA. In instances in which the state provisions are more stringent than or differ from HIPAA, providers must comply with both the applicable federal and state standards. Failure to comply with applicable federal or state standards could subject Clearday to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. HIPAA enforcement efforts have increased considerably over the past few years, with HHS, through its Office for Civil Rights, entering into several multi-million dollar HIPAA settlements in recent years. Finally, the Office for Civil Rights and other regulatory bodies have become increasingly focused on cybersecurity risks, including the emerging threat of ransomware and similar cyber-attacks. The increasing sophistication of cybersecurity threats presents challenges to the entire healthcare industry.
 
The recent Presidential election results will likely change the regulatory environment for healthcare and Clearday is unable to predict the impact of these or other regulatory reform efforts. While we expect that there will be a Secretary of HHS that will reinvigorate the Healthcare Reform Act with many aspects that were adopted by the Obama / Biden administration, the extent of such efforts and the impact cannot be estimated by Clearday. Such changes may require us to incur additional expenses.
 
Insurance
 
Litigation against senior living and healthcare companies continues to increase, and liability insurance costs continue to increase as a result. In addition, Clearday’s employee benefit costs, including health insurance and workers’ compensation insurance, generally continue to increase.
 
In addition to existing government regulation, Clearday is subject to numerous property and hospitality regulations applicable to the other segments of Clearday’s business of non-core assets.

Human Capital
 
Number of Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, Clearday had approximately 225 employees, substantially all of which were employed for the benefit of our residential care business and our innovative care and wellness products and services. None of Clearday’s employees are expected to be subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.
Human Capital Definition and Scope
 
Clearday defines “human capital” as the resources that may be retained and deployed by Clearday to achieve its business strategies and objectives by properly governing and managing:

● | Clearday’s longevity care and wellness businesses; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The continued innovation of Clearday’s businesses including our adult day care, digital services, robotics and related services; 
● | Clearday’s general governance and administrative functions, including management of our financial capital and physical capital assets; and 
● | The liquidation and other monetization of our non-core assets held for disposition. 

 
Clearday uses a combination of full-time employees and outsourced capabilities from independent contractors, including accounting and finance professionals.
 
Substantially all of Clearday’s human capital are the employees of our residential care businesses. Our additional human capital include our executive teams and those who focus on our innovative care businesses. There are several levels of human capital at MCA, including:
 

● | Senior management such as the President of MCA, each Executive Director of a facility, the head of education and training and the head of non-residential services; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Program staff, including those that present at Clearday’s digital adult day care service Clearday at Home; 
● | Senior management and staff at Memory Care America residential facilities, including: 


○ | Nursing professionals such as Registered Nurses, Licensed Vocational Nurses, and Licensed Practical Nurses; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | Certified Nursing Assistants and Certified Medication Aids 
○ | Resident Assistants; 
○ | Home Health Aids; 
○ | Certified Medication Aids; and 
○ | Other staff including housekeeping and food and beverage. 

 
The number and level of staff at a residential or non-residential care facility is determined by several factors, primarily, the regulatory requirements and the number of residents or clients. Historically, the regulatory requirements have been stable, until the COVID-19 pandemic. The response by federal and state health regulatory authorities have been significant and required increased staff levels during 2021. Clearday is not able to adequately predict the extent of additional actions that may be taken by such authorities.
 
Human Capital Policy
 
Clearday’s human capital policy is to promote a culture of mutual respect that is aligned and promotes the governance and management of Clearday’s business strategies and objectives with substantially all of the senior executive functions performed by its employees with the additional use of outsourced capabilities primarily when such consultants or professionals have significant and required expertise or when such use is expected to be more efficient than full-time employees. Clearday believes that certain independent contractors will continue to be important to innovate Clearday’s business, including Thinktiv, our consultant that has been retained to provide services, including market and competitive research, develop Clearday’s technology enabled service platform, and our market strategy for its Clearday at Home and Clearday Club business models. Clearday will also retain other outside counsel and other professionals from time to time as we determine appropriate.
Material Changes in Human Capital
 
Since January, 2020, consistent with Clearday’s human capital policy, Clearday has retained professionals to strengthen its financial, legal and administrative capabilities, including professionals responsible for timely reporting as a public company under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, Clearday has increased its human capital in its accounting and finance department to reduce our reliance on outside independent contractors and financial consultants.

Clearday has experienced an amount of executive turnover in its residential care business which Clearday believes is customary in the industry. There has been turnover in our executive and financial reporting. Clearday believes that its turnover in our residential care business is driven primarily by compensation available by other employers, including other residential care facilities, and the personal mental demands of providing the highest quality of care with dedication to protecting the most vulnerable demographic, including those suffering from dementia and other cognitive or physical limitations.
 
Diversity
 
Clearday is committed to expanding the diversity of its human capital. In our residential care business, the management team, including its President, is more than 60% women and more than 15% are minority. Our 4 independent Board directors include one woman, one minority and one elder American.
 
Clearday’s policies do not permit intolerant statements or actions, including those that are demeaning or prejudicial to persons of any nationality, culture, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, gender or gender identification, age, cognitive or physical limitation or other social class. Violations or allegations of any violations may be directed to the Human Resources Executive, currently Clearday’s Chief Financial Officer, or Clearday’s Chairman for appropriate investigation and resolution by appropriate action that may include termination for cause. Clearday’s policy is to enable the continued development and advancement of its employees through education, including Clearday’s Technicians of Cognitive Care program and reimbursement for continued professional education. In addition, the Company offers sales and marketing seminars, including the seminars and coaching provided personally by Clearday’s CEO. Of our residential care business’ 5 Executive Director positions and its President, 3 (60%) of these positions were filled by employee promotions.
 
Human Capital Evaluation
 
Clearday considers numerous factors in determining the compensation for, and the amount (number) of, its human capital that is required for the proper administration and promotion of its business strategies and objectives, including Clearday’s ability to promote Clearday’s vision for its services through the following set of key principles which we refer to as The Clearday Way:
 
Provide Clearday’s customers with safe, positive community based environments that increase their independence, social engagement, and overall well-being.
 
Deliver personalized programming and therapies that prolong Clearday’s members’ ability to live at home, rather than transitioning to full-time residential care.
 
Give Clearday’s members’ families the comfort of knowing their loved ones are enjoying their days with Clearday, whether at home, in a daily care Club, or in one of Clearday’s living centers
 
Reduce economic anxiety for Clearday’s members and their families by offering innovative new care options at a fraction of the price of residential care.
 
Create innovative work environments, empowering development programs, and a purpose-driven culture that attracts and retains the highest quality caregiving staff.
 
Compensation includes wages, promotions, salary increases and bonus compensation and equity based compensation that is believed by the Clearday Board to promote the human capital processes and goals that are summarized above, in addition to customary industry metrics.
 
Clearday evaluates its human capital using several qualitative metrics and with customary employee performance metrics, such as on-time performance and achievement of applicable assigned tasks. Clearday’s senior management in the residential and non-residential care business, such as Memory Care America and adult day care, also evaluate human capital based on an individual’s dignity and respect for the residents and clients and their dedication to energize and improve a resident’s and client’s quality of life, and adding some fun and enjoyment in their day, as well as their compliance with Clearday’s infectious control policies.
 
Certain Corporate Executive Officers
 
Clearday has a smaller number of Clearday executive officers that focus their time and attention to general administration and financial capital matters, including Clearday’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and its General Counsel and other executive officers including our Executive Vice President—Director of Real Estate Operations, and the President of our residential care business (the “HQ Executives”). Compensation for the HQ Executives is determined by the Clearday Board. In determining the compensation for each HQ Executive, Clearday considers, among other things, such officer’s achievement of material business strategies and objectives, including their:

● | Accomplishments during the year compared to annual objectives; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Support to “line” management in operations and innovations and other contributions to Clearday’s human capital to achieve Clearday’s business strategies and objectives; 
● | Contribution and improvement to Clearday’s human capital culture; 
● | Identification and mitigation of risks to Clearday, its businesses and people; 
● | Ability for future development and undertaking or managing additional tasks; 
● | Background, training, education and experience; and 
● | Compensation of similarly situated executives in the San Antonio, Texas executive employment market.

HQ Executive Compensation Philosophy and Process
 
Clearday’s compensation has been established under the policies of the Clearday Board and is designed to help Clearday achieve its business strategies and objectives, which include increasing, on a long term basis, the value of Clearday by improving Clearday’s financial and operating performance, improving Clearday’s competitive position within its industry, innovating and improving Clearday’s care and wellness services and products and managing risks facing Clearday.
 
Individual performance is an important factor in determining each element of compensation. Clearday’s Board determines, and after this offering, Clearday’s Compensation Committee will determine:
 

● | The executive officers that are considered an HQ Executive; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The cash annual and bonus compensation of Clearday’s HQ Executives; 
● | The amount and terms of equity incentive compensation of Clearday’s HQ Executives; and 
● | All other compensation and benefits of Clearday’s HQ Executives. 

 
There is no formulaic approach to such determinations and such determinations are made by the Clearday Board (and will be made by the Compensation Committee) in their discretion. In exercising such discretion, the Clearday Board (or Compensation Committee) may rely on the benefit of reports and information provided by counsel, accountants and other professionals, including compensation consultants.
 
The compensation is intended to further align the interests of the HQ Executives with those of the Clearday’s stockholders. Equity compensation is used to foster such alignment. Additionally, cash bonuses may be used when Clearday has achieved net cash flow that is not reinvested in the businesses or used for distributions.
 
The primary factor considered by the Compensation Committee and the Board when determining discretionary compensation for the HQ Executive is the historical cash and equity compensation paid to such individual and to the other HQ Executives with similar specific areas of expertise and value to Clearday, and the likelihood that the Clearday could find a suitable replacement on a timely and cost effective basis.
 
In addition to the consideration of the various factors described in the preceding paragraphs, the Clearday Board considers (and Compensation Committee will consider) available compensation data for similarly situated companies or that possess size or other characteristics that are similar to Clearday.
 
Clearday Compensation philosophy and procedures are intended to limit incentives for management to take excessive risk for short term benefit.

Material Changes in our Business and the AIU Merger
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on May 11, 1987 shortly after the discovery of HTS materials. Our business, prior to our cost reduction plan announced on January 28, 2020, focused on developing and commercializing high temperature superconductor (“HTS”) materials and related technologies for the commercial marketplace. We also developed and had commercialized our Sapphire Cryocooler and its related patents and intellectual property. This product and related intellectual property rights are used in our development of a cryogenic air quality system.
 
On January 28, 2020, we announced a cost reduction plan for the purpose of aligning our personnel needs and capital requirements as we explored strategic alternatives previously announced. We maintained operations of our Sapphire Cryocooler cryogenics initiatives while ceasing additional manufacturing of our HTS Conductus® wire. The cost reduction plan also included a 70% reduction of the then employee workforce. Subsequent to the announcement about our cost reduction plan, we started the process of selling, in separate transactions, assets that we deemed non-essential going forward. The aggregate sales prices of the post January 28th transactions was approximately $1,075,000, all sold to purchasers having no affiliation with us. As a result of these sales, we exited HTS wire operations and pursued other strategic alternatives, including the AIU Merger.
 
On September 9, 2021, we closed a merger (the “AIU Merger”) with Allied Integral United, Inc. (“AIU”). The AIU Merger was described in the AIU Merger Registration Statement. This is the first Annual Report on Form 10-K by the Company that includes the businesses conducted by AIU prior to the AIU Merger.

On September 9, 2021:
 

● | The AIU Merger was completed. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In connection with, and prior to completion of, the AIU Merger, the Company (1) effected a 3.773585 -for-1 share reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of its Common Stock resulting in a decrease of outstanding shares of common stock from 2,751,780 to approximately 729,222; and (2) changed its name to “Clearday, Inc.” 
● | A special distribution for the issuance and delivery of additional shares of its common stock (“True Up Shares”) to the holders of its shares of Clearday Common Stock of record as of 5:00 pm Eastern Time on September 9, 2021 was declared, which provided for the distribution of an aggregate amount of approximately 546,820 shares of such Common Stock (representing a dividend rate of approximately 0.749868); such shares were distributed on or about September 20, 2021. 

 
Under the terms of the AIU Merger:
 

● | There was an increase in the number of shares of AIU common stock (2:1), 50% of the shares of AIU’s 6.75% Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into AIU common stock and then the shares of AIU common stock were exchanged for shares of Clearday, Inc. Common Stock at an exchange ratio of approximately 1.192 shares of Common Stock for each share of AIU common stock; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Each share of AIU’s 6.75% Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock that was not converted into AIU common stock were exchanged for an equal number of a new series of preferred stock issued by Clearday, par value $0.001 per share that are designated Clearday 6.75% Series F Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred”), which provide substantially similar terms as the AIU Series A Preferred, except that such preferred stock will convert to that number of shares of the Clearday’s Common Stock after giving effect to the exchange ratio used in the Merger or 2.384675 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exchange of 1 share of Series F Preferred; 
● | The Company assumed the obligations of the warrants issued by AIU so that such warrants now represent the right to be exercised for shares of the Clearday’s Common Stock equal to approximately 3,781,509 shares; 
● | Clearday assumed the obligation to issue its shares of Common Stock with respect to the (1) 10.25% Series I Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“AIU Alt Care Preferred”) issued by AIU Alternative Care, Inc. (“AIU Alt Care”), a subsidiary of AIU, and (2) units of limited partnership interest (“Clearday OZ LP Interests”) of Clearday Alternative Care OZ Fund LP (“Clearday OZ Fund”), a subsidiary of AIU Alt Care, which as of the effective date of the merger was equal to an aggregate amount of approximately $15,253,740 of investment and accrued dividends. 

 
The merger was accounted for as a reverse asset acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Under this method of accounting, AIU was deemed to be the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes. This determination was primarily based on the facts that, immediately following the Merger: (i) AIU’s stockholders owned a substantial majority of the voting rights in us as of the effective time of the AIU Merger, (ii) AIU designated a majority of the members of the initial board of directors of us as of the effective time of the AIU Merger, and (iii) AIU’s senior management holds all key positions in the senior management of us as of the effective time of the AIU Merger. As a result, as of the closing date of the AIU Merger, the net assets of the Company were recorded at their acquisition-date relative fair values in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and the reported operating results prior to the AIU Merger are those of AIU. You may obtain additional information regarding the AIU Merger in our Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on November 24, 2021 and our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 10, 2021.
 
COVID-19
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, which spread throughout the U.S. and the world, as a pandemic and has had a significant impact on the global economy, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. National and local governments around the world instituted certain measures, including travel bans, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain non-essential businesses, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing. The governmental response includes additional protocols for the health and safety of residents and staff in the Company’s facilities. The outbreak and associated restrictions on travel that have been implemented have had a material adverse impact on the Company’s business and cash flow from operations, similar to many businesses. The Company has begun, and intends to continue, to resume normal operations as soon as practicable. However, during 2021, the Delta and Omicron variants of the COVID-19 become the predominant COVID-19 strains in the United States and put a renewed focus on prevention and caused many governments and other authorities to re-institute preventive measures to mitigate the risk of hyperlocal outbreaks. The total impact of COVID-19 is unknown. As a result, management has concluded that there was a long-lived asset impairment triggering event during 2020 and 2021, which required management to perform an impairment evaluation. See Note 5 – Discontinued Operations for additional discussion and results.
 
Other Assets and Investments
 
We have sold certain assets that are not related to our core businesses. Such sales include the sale of hospitality assets and other real property assets, as described in this Report under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Our Proprietary Technology
 
In furtherance of our business that we conducted prior to our material changes in our business discussed above, we had developed an extensive patent portfolio as well as critical trade secrets, unpatented technology and proprietary knowledge. As discussed above, we have sold most of the patents related to our HTS wires business subsequent to January 28, 2020. We retained patents related to our Sapphire Cryocooler technology: In July 2017, EU patent 2188495 (08797906.8) was granted, this patent follows the U.S. Patent granted by U.S. 8,607,560. This patent is focused on METHOD FOR CENTERING RECIPROCATING BODIES AND STRUCTURES MANUFACTURED THEREWITH, related to our Sapphire Cryocooler. We have used the STI Sapphire Cryocooler and related technologies as the basis for the development of our cryogenic air quality system.
 
We enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, suppliers and consultants to the extent that we believe appropriate to protect our proprietary information. Our technologies that enable our digital service Clearday at Home is not subject to patent protection. We have registered the mark Clearday with the United States Patent office for use in our businesses.
 
Government Contracts
 
We had revenues from Government Contracts prior to the AIU Merger. We do not have any material government contracts, although we may seek government contracts for our cyro-pure air system.
Manufacturing
 
We do not have any manufacturing processes as our manufacturing of Conductus wire prior to the AIU Merger ceased in the first quarter of 2020. We produce content for our Clearday at Home digital service primarily from our production facilities located at 8800 Village Drive, Suite 106, San Antonio, TX 78217.
Backlog
 
Our commercial backlog consisted of accepted product purchase orders with scheduled delivery dates during the next twelve months. We had no commercial backlog at December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020.
Research and Development
 
Our 2020 and 2021 research and development activities were focused entirely on developing our innovative care products, including the content and technologies for our Clearday at Home digital service.
 
Our aggregate research and development expenses during 2020 were approximately $1,919,180, of which approximately $178,000 was incurred by STI prior to the AIU Merger and approximately $1,741,180 was incurred by AIU during 2020. We have not spent any amounts in research and development during 2021.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property, such as us, may be held liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, including, among others, petroleum and materials containing asbestos, that could be located on, in, at, or under a property, regardless of how such materials came to be located there. Additionally, such an owner or operator of real property may incur costs relating to the release of hazardous or toxic substances, including government fines and payments for personal injuries or damage to adjacent property. The cost of any required investigation, remediation, removal, mitigation, compliance, fines, or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the property’s value and/or our assets’ value. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate the damage caused by such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell such property, to attract additional residents, retain existing residents, to borrow using such property as collateral, or to develop or redevelop such property. Such laws impose liability for investigation, remediation, removal, and mitigation costs on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at third-party sites. Such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence, release, or disposal of such substances as well as without regard to whether such release or disposal was in compliance with law at the time it occurred. Moreover, the imposition of such liability upon us could be joint and several, which means we could be required to pay for the cost of cleaning up contamination caused by others who have become insolvent or otherwise judgment proof. We do not believe that we have incurred such liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.
 
Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, including those relating to: the handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of medical waste products generated at our communities; identification and warning of the presence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, as well as removal of such materials; the presence of other substances in the indoor environment; and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with development or construction of our properties.

Some of our communities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents, including, for example, blood-contaminated bandages, swabs and other medical waste products, and incontinence products of those residents diagnosed with an infectious disease. The management of infectious medical waste, including its handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal, is subject to regulation under various federal, state, and local environmental laws. These environmental laws set forth the management requirements for such waste, as well as related permit, record-keeping, notice, and reporting obligations. Our communities’ engagement of waste management companies for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste does not immunize us from alleged violations of such medical waste laws for operations for which we are responsible even if carried out by such waste management companies, nor does it immunize us from third-party claims for the cost to cleanup disposal sites at which such wastes have been disposed. Any finding that we are not in compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.
 
Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management to identify and warn, via signs and labels, their employees and certain other employers operating in the building of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials in their buildings. The regulations also set forth employee training, record-keeping requirements, and sampling protocols pertaining to asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. Building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials. The regulations may affect the value of a building containing asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials in which we have invested. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling, and/or disposal of asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation, or demolition of a building. Such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release to the environment of asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials.
 
The presence of mold, lead-based paint, contaminants in drinking water, radon, and/or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may lead to the incurrence of costs for remediation, mitigation, or the implementation of an operations and maintenance plan. Furthermore, the presence of mold, lead-based paint, contaminants in drinking water, radon, and/or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may present a risk that third parties will seek recovery from the owners, operators, or tenants of such properties for personal injury or property damage. In some circumstances, areas affected by mold may be unusable for periods of time for repairs, and even after successful remediation, the known prior presence of extensive mold could adversely affect the ability of a community to retain or attract residents and could adversely affect a community’s market value.
 
We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws. We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state, and local environmental regulation and legislation. Changes in the environmental regulatory framework (including legislative or regulatory efforts designed to address climate change) could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because environmental laws vary from state to state, expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our communities. We did not make any material capital expenditures in connection with environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances and regulations in 2021 or 2020.
