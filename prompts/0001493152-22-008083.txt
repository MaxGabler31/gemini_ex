Understanding Our Approach – The AgriFORCE Precision Growth Method
 
Traditional farming includes three fundamental approaches: outdoor, greenhouse and indoor. AgriFORCE introduces a unique fourth method, the AgriFORCE precision growth method, which is informed by cutting-edge science and leveraging the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT).

With a carefully optimized approach to facility design, IoT, AI utilization, nutrient delivery, and micro-propagation, we have devised an intricate, scientific and high success-oriented approach designed to produce much greater efficacy yields using fewer resources. This method is intended to outperform traditional growing methods using a specific combination of new and traditional techniques required to attain this efficiency. We call it precision growth. The AgriFORCE precision growth method focuses on addressing some of the most important legacy challenges in agriculture: environmental impact, operational efficiency and yield volumes.
 
The AgriFORCE precision growth method presents a tremendous opportunity to positively disrupt all corners of the industry. The market size of just the nutraceutical and plant-based pharmaceutical and vaccine/therapeutics market is over $500 billion. Including the traditional hydroponics high value crops and controlled-environment food markets, the addressable market approaches nearly $1 trillion. (1)(2)(3).
 
While our patent pending intellectual property initially targeted the hydroponics sector of our customers high value crops to showcase its efficacy in a growing market, we are currently expanding operations to refine our technology and methodology for our customers’ vegetables and fruit food crops. Hydroponics was identified as an ideal sector to demonstrate proof of concept However, management has decided that the Company focus on evolving our intellectual property and applying our precision growth method to other agricultural areas so that we can be a part of the solution in fixing the severe issues with the global food supply chain.
 
The AgriFORCE Model – Managing the Difficulties of Agricultural Verticals with Modern Technology and Innovation
 
Our intellectual property combines a uniquely engineered facility design and automated growing system to provide a clear solution to the biggest problems plaguing most agricultural verticals. It delivers a clean, self-contained environment that maximizes natural sunlight and offers near ideal supplemental lighting. It also limits human intervention and – crucially – it was designed to provide superior quality control. It was also created to drastically reduce environmental impact, substantially decrease utility demands, as well as lower production costs, while delivering customers daily harvests and higher crop yields.
 
Plants grow most robustly and flavorfully in full natural sunlight. While it may seem counterintuitive to some, even the clearest of glass greenhouses inhibit the full light spectrum of the sun. However, new translucent and transparent membrane materials have emerged recently that enable the near-full-transmission of the sun’s light spectrum.

 (3) https://medium.com/artemis/lets-talk-about-market-size-316842f1ab27
 
Unlike plastic or glass, these new transparent membranes can help crops achieve their full genetic (and flavor) potential. Natural light also warms the microclimate when necessary, dramatically reducing heating energy requirements. And at times when the sun is not cooperating, advances in supplemental grow lighting can extend the plants’ photoperiod – even beyond natural daylight hours – to maximize crop growth, quality, and time to harvest by up to 50% or better.
 
Greenhouses and vertical farms are also compromised by outdoor and human-introduced contamination. The new model relies on creating a sealed, cleanroom-like microclimate that keeps pests, pesticides and other pollutants outside.

Thanks to artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and similar advances, farmers can now benefit from highly automated growing systems that reduce human intervention and its associated costs. Finely tuned convective air circulation systems enable the microclimate to remain sealed and protected. Natural temperature regulation using sunlight and organic foam-based clouds can significantly reduce air-conditioning electricity requirements. Highly automated hydration, fertilization and lighting are all continuously optimized by machine learning.
 
This new AgriFORCE model, which has been designed with more than four years of ongoing research and development, is set to be put into large scale practice when the first of three new grow facilities completes construction on a 41-acre site in Coachella, California we expect to purchase in the coming year. This unique approach, which included contributions from lighting experts who had previously worked at NASA sending plants into space, was developed to significantly improve local food security in an environmentally friendly way. It uses the best aspects of current our customers’ current growing methods – outdoor, greenhouse and indoor – and replaces their shortcomings with better technology and processes.
 
Any solution whether in agriculture, industry, or consumer goods is typically the integration of various disparate parts which, in and of themselves, require independent skill sets and levels of expertise to bring together the desired outcome. Controlled environment agriculture solutions such as our patent pending proprietary facility and automated grow system are no different. Centered around four pillars: facility and lighting; automation and AI; nutrients and fertigation and micropropagation and genetics, our business not only has a tremendous opportunity to grow organically by virtue of its existing contracts and a future pipeline of similar contracts, but also through accretive acquisitions.
 
Our Position in the Ag-Tech Sector
 
The Ag-Tech sector is severely underserved by the capital markets, and we see an opportunity to acquire global companies who have provided solutions to the industry and are leading innovation moving forward. We are creating a separate corporate office to aggressively pursue such acquisitions. The robustness of our engagement with potential targets has confirmed our belief and desire to be part of a larger integrated Ag-Tech solutions provider, where each separate element of the business has its existing legacy business and can leverage across areas of expertise to expand their business footprint. We believe that there is currently no one that we are aware of who is pursuing this model in the US capital markets environment at this time.

The AgriFORCE Grow House
 
The Company is an agriculture-focused technology company that delivers innovative and reliable, financially robust solutions for high value crops through our proprietary facility design and automation IP to businesses and enterprises globally. The Company intends to operate in the plant based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and high value crop markets using its unique proprietary facility design and hydroponics based automated growing system that enable cultivators to effectively grow crops in a controlled environment. The Company calls its facility design and automated growing system the “AgriFORCE grow house”. The Company has designed its AgriFORCE grow house to produce in virtually any environmental condition and to optimize crop yields to as near their full genetic potential possible while substantially eliminating the need for the use of pesticides, fungicides and/or irradiation. The Company is positioning itself to deliver solutions to a growing industry where end users are demanding environmentally friendly and sustainable, controlled growing environments and processes. The initial market focus is the cultivation of food and other high value crops in California, and proof of concept will be to apply the IP to biomass production of plant based vaccine materials. The Company believes that its IP will provide a lower cost cultivation solution for the indoor production of crops due to a combination of higher crop quality and yields, and reduced operating costs. The Company has designed its AgriFORCE grow house as a modular growing facility that it plans to build and license to licensed operators for the cultivation of food and high value crops. The AgriFORCE grow house incorporates a design and technology that is the subject of a provisional patent that the Company has submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office on March 7, 2019. On March 6, 2020, a New International Patent Application No. PCT/CA2020/050302 Priority Claim United States 62/815, 131 was filed. The Company’s IP can be adapted to a multitude of crops and required growing conditions where exacting environmental control and pharma grade equivalent cleanliness and processes are required to meet the highest cultivation standards. By delivering the first facility, the Company will be in a position to demonstrate the performance and to target Good Manufacturing Practices standards compliance necessary to engage the pharma industry as it moves into modifying its IP to meet the particular plant biomass requirements for vaccines and other pharma biomass.
 
As the Company commences construction of its micropropagation facility and grow house, it will start to develop its solution for fruits and vegetables focusing on the integration of its current structure with a new form of vertical grow technology. Although many of the components and elements will be the same or similar in nature, the automation and integration for going vertical and accommodating lighting, circulation, climate control and humidity control will be somewhat different. Therefore, the Company intends to develop a small working commercial facility as it moves to finalize design and engineering. The Company believes it can deliver new IP for vertical farming with a view to constructing its first commercial facility to serve the Southern California market for fresh local leafy greens (first crop) before rolling out its solution to address other crops and other local markets in the United States and internationally.
 
Our Intellectual Property Strategy
 
The Company’s IP and business is focused on four (4) key elements:
 

1) | FACILITY AND LIGHTING DESIGN 
---+---------------------------------

 
-the facility utilizes a proprietary building envelope system that allows virtually the full light spectrum and substantial portions of the UV light spectrum through it. It is fully sealed and utilizes positive air pressure exchange to create a microclimate that optimizes temperature, humidity, CO2, air velocity, filtration, and sanitation through the process of biomimicry.
 
-Advanced proprietary supplemental grow lighting technologies achieving optimal luminous efficacy, spectrum, distribution characteristics, automated DLI management and fixture architecture.

AgriFORCE Brands
 
The Company purchased Intellectual Property (“IP”) from Manna Nutritional Group, LLC (“MNG”), a privately held firm based in Boise, Idaho on September 10, 2021. The IP encompasses patent-pending technologies to naturally process and convert grain, pulses and root vegetables, resulting in low-starch, low-sugar, high-protein, fiber-rich baking flour produces as well as wide range of breakfast cereals, juices, natural sweeteners and baking enhancers. The core process is covered under a pending patent application in the U.S. and key international markets. The all-natural process is designed to unlock nutritional properties, flavor and other qualities in a range of modern, ancient and heritage grains, pulses and root vegetables to create specialized All-Natural baking and all-purpose flours, sweeteners, juices, naturally sweet cereals and other valuation products, providing numerous opportunities for dietary nutritional, performance and culinary applications.
 
The Company will rebrand the consumer products and innovative ingredient offering for food manufacturers under the brand (un)Think foods.


Wheat and Flour Market
 
Modern diet is believed to be a contributor to health risks such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity, due in part to the consumption of highly processed foods that are low in natural fiber, protein and nutrition; and extremely high in simple starch, sugar and calories. These “empty carbs” produce glycemic swings that may cause overeating by triggering cravings for food high in sugar, salt and starch. As an example, conventional baking flour is low in natural fiber (about 2-3%), low-to-average in protein (about 9%), and very high in starch (about 75%). Whole wheat flour is only marginally better. Similarly, gluten-free products are often produced with sugar and starches such as potato flour, rice flour, tapioca, etc. Gluten-free products are typically low-fiber, low-nutrition, high-starch and high-calorie.

In contrast, foods high in fiber help to satiate hunger, suppress cravings, raise metabolism and require more calories to digest. They also assist in weight loss, lower cholesterol, and may reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes.
 
Advantages of the MNG IP 
 
The CERES-MNG process allows for the development and manufacturing of All-natural Fours that are significantly higher in Fibers, Nutrients and Proteins and significantly lower in Carbohydrates and Calories than Standard Baking Flour.
 
As shown in the graph below, MNG Baking Flour produced from Soft White Wheat has 30 time more fiber, 3 times more protein, 80% less starch and 50-60% less calories as compared to standard all- purpose baking flour.



The CERES-MNG patent pending process will help develop new flours and products from modern, ancient and heritage grains, seeds, legumes and tubers/root vegetables.

The Company’s IP can be adapted to a multitude of crops and required growing conditions where exacting environmental control and pharma grade equivalent cleanliness and processes are required to meet the highest cultivation standards. 
● | On April 22, 2021, the Company terminated its agreement with PharmHaus, its initial exclusive Independent Operator, as PharmHaus failed to demonstrate the business wherewithal to serve in its capacity as an exclusive Independent Operator. 
● | The Company has substantially finalized the final design and engineering drawings for the AgriFORCE grow house. 
● | On November 30, 2021, the Company signed an offtake agreement with Humboldt Bliss, Ltd., a Barbadian limited company (“Humboldt”). Under the terms of the contract, AgriFORCE is responsible for constructing its proprietary facility and providing the full Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of the AgriFORCE Grow House and Humboldt is responsible for securing the project’s land as well as operating the facility. Upon production, Humboldt has committed to remit an IP licensing, management services and equipment leasing fee to AgriFORCE for up to 14,300 pounds (6,500 kgs) of high value medical and agricultural crops per year. David Welch, a director of the Company, owns a controlling interest in Humboldt am dos this a related party. Mr. Welch recused himself from the final deliberation and approval of the agreement by the board. 
● | On February 18, 2022, the Company signed a license agreement with Radical Clean Solutions Ltd (“Radical”), a New York corporation that has development an advanced product line consisting of “smart hydroxyl generation systems” focused on numerous industry verticals that is proven to eliminate 99.99+% of all pathogens, virus, mold, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and allergy triggers, to commercialize their new proprietary hydroxyl generating devices within the controller environment agriculture (“CEA”)and food manufacturing industries. The patent pending system seeks out and destroys both airborne and surface-based mold, bacteria, virus, odorous and volatile organic compounds and allergy triggers, as well as other pathogens and pollutants in real-time. The license grants the rights to AgriFORCE in perpetuity as well as joint patent ownership rights for CEA. 

Debt Financing
 
The Company signed a Term Sheet with Capital Funding Group on April 8, 2020 for the provision of debt related to the potential purchase of a property in Coachella, CA and all site improvements and infrastructure. The Term Sheet was further renewed on February 5, 2021. The terms of the debt are to provide 50% of the value of the land purchase price and 80% of the value of the site improvements and infrastructure. The value of the debt is expected to be approximately $12,000,000. The interest rate applicable to the land purchase is 10.5% per annum and for the site improvements and infrastructure it is 15.5% annum. In order to complete the debt facility agreement, the Company will need to raise approximately $4,500,000 in equity by February 1, 2021. The term of the loan is eighteen months. The Company expects to re-finance at the completion of the improvements and infrastructure through traditional lending sources. The Company is also in discussions with respect to debt financing for the grow house structure as well as the associated equipment including but not limited to the HVAC system and the automated growing system through the same debt broker used to secure the Capital Funding Group loan facility term sheet. Capital Funding Group has agreed to provide such debt financing subject to the completion of a development appraisal and final approval by its board of directors. There can be no assurance as to whether the Company will be able to secure further debt or secure such debt on commercially reasonable terms.

On March 24, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors for the purchase of $750,000 in principal amount ($600,000 subscription amount) of senior secured debentures originally due June 24, 2021 (the “Bridge Loan”). On June 24, 2021, the due date was extended to July 12, 2021. The imputed interest rate is encompassed within the original issue discount of the debentures and no additional cash interest shall be due. The debentures were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to certain purchasers who are accredited investors within the meaning of Rule 501 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Each debenture holder will receive a warrant to purchase shares of common stock in an amount equal to 50% of the principal amount divided by 80% of the initial public offering price of the Company’s common stock. The warrants are exercisable at 80% of the initial public offering price. Transaction costs of $69,000 have been recorded in connection with the Bridge Loan. The Bridge Loan was fully repaid on July 13, 2021.
 
The Company’s Initial California EIO (Exclusive Independent Operator)
 
The Company has terminated its EIO agreements (the “PharmHaus Agreements”) with PharmHaus, a private company that is arms-length to AgriFORCE. The Company had entered into each of the following agreements, on the terms outlined above, with PharmHaus as the EIO (the “PharmHaus Agreements”):

● | Cultivation Facility Lease Agreement; 
--+------------------------------------------
● | IP License Agreement; and 
● | Management Services Agreement. 

 
PharmHaus required additional financing in order to achieve its business plan and objectives and in order to perform its contractual obligations under the Company’s agreements with PharmHaus. There was no assurance that PharmHaus would be able to obtain such funding. As a result of PharmHaus’ inability to secure funding and the Company’s focus on food and pharma applications of its IP as well as acquisition opportunities outside of the cannabis market, the Company chose to terminate its contract with PharmHaus on April 22, 2021. 
 
Micropropagation Laboratories

The Company has undertaken the steps described below in connection with the design and deployment of the Company’s micropropagation laboratories. These laboratories will ultimately be deployed at the Company’s AgriFORCE grow houses. However, the Company has identified a business opportunity through a current micropropagation lab which requires additional capacity for deployment of the micropropagation laboratories for plantlet growth in advance of the completion of the initial AgriFORCE grow houses. The advantage of the Company for pursuing this opportunity is that it enables the Company to achieve initial revenues in advance of incurring the full construction expenditure required for the initial AgriFORCE grow houses, thereby providing internally generated funding for the Company’s expenditures and tests of the micropropagation process with the selected crops:

● | the Company has completed the evaluation of options for construction of the micropropagation facility; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the Company has completed the determination of the most suitable low capital expenditure option providing flexibility; 
● | Acquired in-house expertise through Dr. Laila Benkrima, the Company’s Chief Scientific Officer, who has a PhD from the University of Paris in horticulture with a specialization in tissue culture and the hybridization and selection of plant varietals; 
● | completed the design of full facility and equipment scope and layout; 
● | identified potential vendors and received final quotations; and 
● | Research and preparation for permitting and licensing requirements.

Our Competitive Conditions
 
Both indoor and greenhouse growing facilities have come to the forefront in recent years. With the advent of new business opportunities and the necessity and demand for increasing efficiency and yields, the facility design for both indoor and greenhouse has been significantly improved through advancing technologies and operational procedures, even more importantly in hybrid facility environments.
 
In recent decades, the greenhouse industry has been transforming from small scale facilities used primarily for research and aesthetic purposes (i.e. botanic gardens) to significantly more large-scale facilities that compete directly with land-based conventional food and ornamental plant production. While indoor growing allows production throughout the year and in most geographical locations, the energy used for lighting and climate control is costly while those systems are critical to the success, efficiency and yield of the operation. In large part due to the recent improvements in growing technology, the industry is witnessing a blossoming like no time before. Greenhouses today are increasingly emerging that are large-scale, capital-infused, more resource conscientious and urban-centered.
 
A major part of this recent transformation in the greenhouse industry has been the rise of a technology-infused Smart Greenhouse Market. Smart Greenhouses feature new levels of technology and automated control systems that allow for further optimization of growing conditions. These technologies include LED grow-lights that provide energy efficient supplemental lighting during cloudy conditions and at night, as well as an array of smart sensors that can detect issues with plants or the growing environment as they arise and trigger responses from different control systems.
 
No matter the country or region, one universal trend is that modern greenhouses are being built closer to metropolitan areas and large transportation hubs. One reason for this shift is to locate greenhouses closer to universities where research opportunities and skilled labor abound. As greenhouses become more tech-heavy, having this close proximity to research institutions will continue to be an important factor in location.

As the market has grown dramatically, it has also experienced clear trends in recent years. Modern greenhouses are becoming increasingly tech-intensive, using LED lights and automated control systems to tailor optimal growing environments. Successful greenhouse companies are scaling significantly and locating their growing facilities near urban hubs to capitalize on the ever-increasing demand for local (sustainable, conscientious, nutritious) food, no matter the season. To accomplish these feats, the greenhouse industry is also becoming increasingly capital-infused, using venture funding and other sources to build out the infrastructure necessary to compete in the current market.
 
As the smart greenhouse market continues to expand, new technologies are also coming online that will shape the future of production. Like before, many of these technologies are being developed for the greenhouse industry in particular. However, perhaps recently more than ever, innovation is also coming from other sectors. From artificial intelligence to Solar PV, new technologies from a wide range of industries are now finding their way into the modern greenhouse.
 
Past and current deficiencies with indoor farming in general have already signaled two important messages. First, there is logical reasoning to support the argument that indoor agriculture will become the norm and play a vital role to our current food (water intensive, non-grain) landscape. It will not be an easy journey, but the industry is growing and evolving at a fascinating speed. Second, technology advancements play a key role in leading the industry to continue to mature and reach greater efficiencies, production, and profitability.
 
As the global population continues to grow, and resources like land and water become more restricted, greenhouse (and hybrid) farming will be a dominant contributor for feeding global population that is just as important as land-based farming.
 
As a whole, the solutions provided to the agriculture industry have been driven by the integration of disparate components predominately lead by the client / farmer, major greenhouse vendors such as Kubo, Van der Hoeven, Certhon and Havecon or by major automation vendors such as Codema Systems or Ridder Group. This has resulted in fragmentation and sub-optimal IP that has not been fully integrated in a form as the Company is endeavoring to provide. Additionally, many solutions often are an amalgamation of disparate parts and vendors that are not necessarily optimized for a particular crop. In the indoor growing space, this is even more pronounced as the facility is often a simple warehouse which is in and of itself suboptimal and the draw backs are more pronounced. Often the integration is led by the cultivators themselves, who often do not possess the necessary skills to effectively manage such a process or it is led by one of the main vendors.
 
Technology
 
The future: hardware, software, & plant physiology
 
Currently innovation is steered by three main drivers: in-house development within companies, technology providers, and “cross-industry pollination”. New and upcoming companies have great potential to create innovative products. When companies showcase how their innovative technology can be applied, other companies can either adapt or further develop these ideas. There are also technology providers who specialize in specific areas of Ag-Tech. Through cross-industry pollination, we can acquire existing technology from other industries for use in greenhouse application.
Lighting/materials
 
Energy costs—primarily associated with lighting—are of major significance in the operation of a greenhouse facility. Lighting is a critical component for growing plants in fully closed environments because it is the primary energy input used by plants for photosynthesis. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were first adopted for indoor growing in the 1970s to supplement natural sunlight more efficiently than previously used incandescent bulbs. With the advancement of LED technology, the cost has dropped significantly over the last 10 years—specifically, LED lighting costs have halved, while their efficacy, or light energy, has more than doubled. We can expect costs to continue to drop as technology develops and this trend continues. Additionally, precise control of lighting can enable the discovery and dissemination of reproducible “light recipes” that are tailored to crops specifically grown indoors. These light recipes are being developed and used by cultivators to manipulate how plants grow, what they taste like, and their nutrient composition.

In addition to lighting, improvements related to materials can also help further efficiency. Companies like Soliculture, are paving the way for a revolution of greenhouse materials. Their LUMO solar panel contains a low density of silicon photovoltaic (PV) strips arranged with space in between to allow light to transmit between the strips. A thin layer of luminescent material is adhered to the backside of the glass, enhancing light quality by converting green light to red light. Red light has the highest efficiency for photosynthesis in plants, and therefore this optimized light spectrum increases yield faster maturation rate, and has proven to contribute to more disease resistant plants.
 
Data/AI
 
Artificial intelligence (“AI”) is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, where humans are certainly not obsolete but essential in leading innovation to significantly enhance results. AI-powered tools are gaining popularity across several industries including agriculture. In the future, we expect AI to be used in operations by means of automation and for predictive analytics.
 
Robots are increasingly replacing humans as we see more fully automated operations. Robots excel at repetitive, precision mundane tasks such as seeding, weeding, and harvesting. Start-up Iron Ox uses robots every step of the way from seed to harvest.
 
This allows allocation of resources elsewhere to focus on their overall production. Robotics also reduce labor costs while increasing efficiency. Currently farming is facing a labor shortage for reasons ranging from immigration policy to a lack of desire to work in the industry. Robots can help fill in the gaps in missing labor.
 
AI and machine learning technologies are developed to integrate and deliver more precise control of comprehensive growing operations. Ag-Tech company, Autogrow, provides intelligent automation systems including pH sensors, irrigation, and climate control products. Both hardware and software are improving to become more analytical and help detect and solve problems such as pest management, nutrient solution maintenance, and disease prevention.
 
Automation will become more feasible and available as AI technology improves and becomes less expensive. Reduced labor costs will allow product prices to decrease, making local food more accessible.
 
Biological Development
 
While improved environmental control and cultivation practices will undoubtedly lead to greater crop yields, biological alterations can more specifically tailor plants to growing environments and consumer needs. Indoor growing environments and processing facilities reduce the need for plant traits which provide stability in the face of environmental fluctuations, pests, pathogens, and post-harvest injury. New plant breeding techniques and genome-editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to promote new plant traits focused on rapid plant growth, performance in low-light environments, plant stature, nutrition, and flavor. Coupling heightened environmental control with biological control also opens the door for variable gene expression under different growing conditions. This could lead to crop varieties that are distinct from their outdoor counterparts for new culinary applications and create unique markets for produce grown indoors.
 
Industrial synergies
 
With the rise of abundant tech providers and cross-disciplinary innovators, we can expect collaboration and knowledge sharing to become more common. In addition to delivering more effective indoor growing technologies, collaboration may also substantiate partnerships between companies which reduce their ecological footprints. For instance, co-locating greenhouses with industrial power plants can divert carbon dioxide and heat—by products of combustion—from the atmosphere to crops for photosynthesis enhancement and climate control. Furthermore, composted food waste may be diverted from landfills to fertilize crops in soil-based greenhouses. In the other direction, transparent solar panels may enable greenhouses to become net producers of energy to supply nearby buildings without sacrificing crop performance.

New technologies and ideas will better integrate agricultural businesses with the world around them, helping urban and industrial communities become more productive and sustainable.
 
Innovation in technology and practice will be the key drivers of new developments in indoor and greenhouse ag businesses. While these developments will be diverse and multidimensional, their effects will be focused on improvements to the potential scale and efficiency of, and quality of food from, indoor agriculture. Following the greenhouse’s historical trajectory, we believe it is safe to assume its relevance to global food systems will continue to expand as we progress into the future.
