Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical stage biotechnology company developing first-in-class immunology therapeutic product candidates focused on emerging immune control mechanisms applicable to inflammation and immuno-oncology indications. We develop our product candidates using our proprietary antibody discovery technology platform, which is based upon a breakthrough understanding of the natural process of antibody generation, known as somatic hypermutation (“SHM”), and replicates this natural process of antibody generation in vitro. Our strategy is to advance the development of our proprietary product candidates, and where applicable, establish partnerships with leading biopharmaceutical companies where we retain certain development and commercialization rights. Our most advanced wholly-owned antibody programs, imsidolimab, rosnilimab, previously referred to as ANB030, and ANB032, are designed to modulate therapeutic targets that are genetically associated with human inflammatory disorders.
Imsidolimab, our IL-36R antibody previously referred to as ANB019, inhibits the interleukin-36 receptor (“IL-36R”), and is being developed for the treatment of multiple dermatological inflammatory diseases. We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, which was presented at the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in 2018, where imsidolimab was well-tolerated by all subjects, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and no serious adverse events were reported among any subjects in the clinical trial. In July 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) granted Orphan Drug Designation for imsidolimab for the treatment of patients with GPP. We completed an open-label, multi-dose, single-arm Phase 2 clinical trial of imsidolimab in 8 GPP patients, also referred to as the GALLOP clinical trial, where top-line data through week 16 was presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology (EADV) Congress on October 2, 2021. In this trial, 6 of 8 (75%) patients treated with imsidolimab monotherapy achieved the primary endpoint of response on the clinical global impression (“CGI”) scale at week 4 and week 16, without requiring rescue medication. Two of 8 (25%) patients were considered to have not met the primary endpoint because they dropped out of the trial prior to Day 29. The Modified Japanese Dermatology Association severity index total score (mJDA-SI), which incorporates both dermatological and systemic aspects of GPP, decreased for patients on average by 29% at week 1, 54% at week 4 and 58% at week 16. Erythema with pustules, which clinically defines GPP, decreased by 60% at week 1, 94% by week 4 and 98% by week 16. Patients achieved a reduction in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), which is a patient- reported measure, of 6 points at week 4 and 11 points by week 16, each of which exceeded the minimal clinically importance difference (MCID) of 4 points. GPP Physician Global Assessment (GPPPGA) scale was implemented by protocol amendment during the course of the trial and was assessed in 4 of the 8 enrolled patients, where zero (clear) or 1 (almost clear) response was achieved in 2 (50%) patients at week 4 and 3 (75%) patients at week 16. Genotypic testing, available for 7 of the 8 patients enrolled, indicated homozygous wild-type IL-36RN, CARD14 and AP1S3 alleles. Through week 16, anti-drug antibodies were only detected in one patient, which occurred at week 12 and did not impact imsidolimab pharmacokinetics or efficacy. Imsidolimab was generally well-tolerated, and most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and resolved without sequelae. No infusion or injection site reactions were observed. One patient dropped out of the clinical trial due to a diagnosis of Staphylococcal aureus bacteremia in the first week, which was a serious adverse event deemed to be possibly drug-related. Because the patient was symptomatic prior to dosing and had a prior medical history of bacteremia, a common comorbidity of GPP, we do not believe this event is likely attributable to imsidolimab. Another patient dropped out of the study on Day 22 due to investigator reported inadequate efficacy. One patient contracted COVID-19 during the course of the clinical trial, which was deemed a serious adverse event unrelated to imsidolimab, and did not lead to study discontinuation. While initial GPP epidemiology studies suggested at least 3,000 GPP patients in the United States, medical claims analyses conducted by IQVIA indicate approximately 37,000 unique patients were diagnosed with GPP at least once, and approximately 15,000 unique patients were diagnosed with GPP at least twice, by a physician between 2017 and 2019 using the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) billing code pertaining to GPP (L40.1). 
We met with the FDA during the second quarter of 2021 for an end-of-Phase 2 meeting to review an orphan disease registration plan for imsidolimab for the treatment of GPP. We initiated our first Phase 3 trial for imsidolimab for GPP, called GEMINI-1, during the third quarter of 2021. GEMINI-1 will enroll approximately 45 moderate-to-severe GPP patients, each undergoing an active flare at baseline, which will be randomized equally to receive a single dose of 750mg intravenous (IV) imsidolimab, 300mg IV imsidolimab or placebo. The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 program is the proportion of patients achieving clear or almost clear skin as determined by a Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Physician’s Global Assessment (GPPPGA) score of zero or 1 at week 4 of GEMINI-1. Patients completing the GEMINI-1 trial will subsequently be enrolled in GEMINI-2, our second Phase 3 trial for imsidolimab in GPP, where they will receive monthly doses of 200mg subcutaneous imsidolimab or placebo depending upon whether they are responders, partial responders or non-responders in treatment under GEMINI-1. The objective of GEMINI-2 is to assess the efficacy and safety of imsidolimab after 6 months of monthly dosing. 
We are conducting a global registry of GPP patients, also referred to as the RADIANCE study, which we anticipate will improve understanding of the patient journey and assist in enrollment of future GPP clinical trials.
We are conducting clinical development of imsidolimab in moderate-to-severe acne. Acne is the most common skin disorder in the United States, with approximately 3 million patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe disease. Moderate-to-severe acne typically presents with painful papules, pustules, nodules, cysts and scarring. A key contributing factor to the pathogenesis of acne is the immune response to Propionibacterium acnes, or P. acnes, which is associated with upregulated IL-36 cytokine activity, localized inflammation, and neutrophil infiltration of the skin. Existing therapies, including isotretinoin and systemic antibiotics, provide variable efficacy for moderate-to-severe acne patients and have practical limitations to their use given potential for clinically meaningful side effects. We are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of imsidolimab, called ACORN, where 120 patients will be randomized equally between two dose levels of imsidolimab and placebo, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne, and we anticipate top-line data during the first half of 2022.
We are conducting clinical development of imsidolimab in hidradenitis suppurativa, also known as acne inversa, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by painful nodules in intertriginous areas that can progress to abscesses, sinus tracks and scarring. Current treatment options for hidradenitis suppurativa, including antibiotics, corticosteroids and anti-TNF therapy, have variable efficacy in moderate-to-severe patients, which often leads to surgery for removal of hidradenitis suppurativa nodules. Human translational studies have demonstrated elevated IL-36 cytokine expression in hidradenitis suppurativa skin biopsies, and we believe treatment of moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa with imsidolimab may lead to therapeutic benefit for this patient population. Moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa affects approximately 150,000 adults in the United States. We are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of imsidolimab in moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa, called HARP, where 120 patients will be randomized equally between two dose levels of imsidolimab and placebo, and we anticipate top-line data during the second half of 2022.
Our second wholly-owned program, rosnilimab, previously referred to as ANB030, is an anti-PD-1 agonist antibody program designed to augment PD-1 signaling through rosnilimab treatment to suppress T-cell driven human inflammatory diseases. Genetic mutations in the PD-1 pathway are known to be associated with increased susceptibility to human inflammatory diseases, and hence we believe that rosnilimab is applicable to diseases where PD-1 checkpoint receptor function may be under-represented. We presented preclinical data for rosnilimab at the Festival of Biologics Annual Meeting in March 2020, including translational data demonstrating in vitro activity of rosnilimab in alopecia areata patient samples. We announced positive top-line data from a healthy volunteer Phase 1 clinical trial of rosnilimab in November 2021. A total of 144 subjects were enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled healthy volunteer Phase 1 trial, where single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts were administered single subcutaneous or intravenous doses of rosnilimab ranging between 0.02mg to 600mg or placebo, while multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts received four weekly subcutaneous doses of rosnilimab ranging between 60mg and 400mg or placebo. Dose escalation was conducted subsequent to data safety monitoring board review of safety and tolerability parameters following each single and multiple ascending dose level. Rosnilimab was generally well-tolerated and no dose limiting toxicities were observed. The most frequent adverse event reported among SAD cohorts was increased circulating C-reactive protein levels of mild severity in nine (10%) rosnilimab-dosed subjects occurring sporadically in a dose-independent manner and a severe occurrence in one (3.3%) placebo-dosed subject. MAD cohorts reported headache as the most frequent adverse event with mild occurrences in three (12.5%) rosnilimab-dosed subjects and none in placebo subjects. Mild injection site reactions were observed in two subjects (11.1%) administered with multiple subcutaneous rosnilimab doses. Two serious adverse events were reported in single dose cohorts, including obstructive pancreatitis in a placebo-dosed subject and COVID-19 infection in a rosnilimab-dosed subject leading to discontinuation which was deemed unrelated to treatment. No serious adverse events were reported in subjects receiving multiple doses of rosnilimab or placebo.
Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated a favorable profile for rosnilimab with an estimated two-week half-life for subcutaneous and intravenous routes of administration and approximately 80% bioavailability. Low-titer anti-drug antibodies were detected at low single dose levels in 19 (21%) rosnilimab-dosed subjects, but none were detected in high single dose or multiple dose subjects. Full PD-1 receptor occupancy was observed rapidly during the first week following single subcutaneous rosnilimab doses at or above 60mg, and was maintained for at least 30 days at or above 200mg single subcutaneous doses. These data support monthly subcutaneous dosing of rosnilimab for future patient trials. Rosnilimab’s pharmacodynamic activity resulted in rapid and sustained reduction in the quantity and functional activity of PD-1+ T cells, which are known to be pathogenic drivers of inflammatory diseases. Conventional T (Tcon) cells (CD3+, CD25 low) expressing PD-1, which represented approximately 25% of peripheral T cells at baseline, were reduced by 50%, including in both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, in a dose-dependent manner and in correlation with receptor occupancy. This effect was maximized on high-PD-1 expressing Tcon cells, which represented approximately 5% of peripheral T cells, with 90% reduction relative to baseline. Conversely, total T cells (CD3+), total Tcon cells (CD3+, CD25low) and total regulatory T (Treg) cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD25 bright, CD127-) were unchanged (<5% change from baseline), resulting in a favorable shift in the ratio of PD-1+ Tcon cells to total Treg cells post-treatment. No effect (<5% reduction from baseline) was observed on any of the aforementioned cell types in placebo-dosed subjects. In addition, an antigen-specific functional T cell recall response, measured as ex vivo interferon-
gamma released in response to tetanus toxoid challenge, was inhibited in a receptor occupancy dependent manner and was consistent with the observed reduction of PD-1+ Tcon cells, to a maximum of approximately 90% relative to baseline within 30 days following single rosnilimab dose, while placebo administration had no effect. Based upon these data, we believe rosnilimab’s in vivo mechanism has the potential to treat T-cell driven human inflammatory diseases. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated AZURE, a randomized placebo-controlled 45-patient Phase 2 trial of rosnilimab in moderate-to-severe alopecia areata patients with at least 50% scalp hair loss for at least 6 months prior to enrollment, where the primary endpoint is change in severity of alopecia tool (SALT) relative to baseline. We continue to assess clinical development opportunities for rosnilimab in additional indications, including vitiligo and rheumatoid arthritis, and will make decisions pending additional data. 
Our third wholly-owned program is an anti-BTLA modulator antibody, known as ANB032, which is broadly applicable to human inflammatory diseases associated with lymphoid and myeloid immune cell dysregulation. Mutations in the BTLA signaling pathway are associated with human inflammatory disease, and we believe ANB032 silences pro-inflammatory signaling by modulating BTLA binding to HVEM. We are conducting a healthy volunteer Phase 1 trial of ANB032, under an Australian Clinical Trial Notification (“CTN”) and anticipate top-line data from this trial during the first half of 2022. We presented preclinical data regarding ANB032 at the 2020 Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies (FOCIS) Virtual Annual Meeting in October 2020.
In addition to our wholly-owned antibody programs, multiple Company-developed antibody programs have been advanced to preclinical and clinical milestones under our collaborations. We have received to date approximately $226.9 million in cash receipts from collaborations. Our collaborations include an immuno-oncology-focused collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline, Inc. (“GSK”) and an inflammation-focused collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (“BMS”). A Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for our most advanced partnered program, which is an anti-PD-1 antagonist antibody called JEMPERLI (dostarlimab), was approved by the FDA in April 2021 for the treatment of advanced or recurrent deficient mismatch repair endometrial cancer (“dMMREC”). This is the first AnaptysBio-generated antibody, of eight currently under clinical development, to obtain FDA approval. We earned a $20.0 million milestone payment as a result of this FDA approval. In addition, in April 2021 the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) granted conditional marketing authorization in the European Union (“EU”) for JEMPERLI for use in women with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer who have progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum containing regimen, which approval makes JEMPERLI the first anti-PD-1 therapy available for endometrial cancer in Europe. We earned a $10.0 million milestone payment as a result of this approval. A second BLA submitted by GSK was accepted by the FDA during the first quarter of 2021 for JEMPERLI in pan-deficient mismatch repair tumors (“PdMMRT”). We received a $10.0 million cash milestone payment upon the FDA acceptance of GSK’s second FDA BLA for JEMPERLI and received $20.0 million cash milestone payment in September 2021, upon FDA approval of this second FDA BLA of JEMPERLI in August. JEMPERLI is currently in clinical development for various solid tumor indications, including dMMREC, PdMMRT, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, rectal cancer, clear cell sarcoma and head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma. GSK is conducting combination trials of dostarlimab with Zejula, belantamab mafodotin (BCMA ADC), GSK6097608 (anti-CD96) and GSK3745417 (STING agonist). In addition, under GSK’s collaboration with iTeos Therapeutics, dostarlimab is being developed in combination with EOS-448 (anti-TIGIT) and inupadenant (A2A receptor antagonist) in various solid tumor indications, including registration-directed trials combining dostarlimab and EOS-448 for first-line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) and a third undisclosed indication. In June 2021, GSK publicly disclosed estimated potential peak annual global JEMPERLI sales on a non-risk adjusted basis of £1-£2 billion, which is currently equal to approximately $1.4 to $2.7 billion based on the GBP to USD exchange rate as of December 31, 2021, for currently approved indications and first-line use in endometrial and ovarian cancer only. In October 2020, we amended our GSK collaboration to increase royalties on global net sales of JEMPERLI to 8% on annual global net sales below $1.0 billion and 12-25% of annual global net sales above $1.0 billion, add a 1% royalty rate on GSK’s global net sales of Zejula and received a one-time cash payment of $60.0 million. In October 2021, we signed a royalty monetization agreement (“Royalty Monetization Agreement”) with Sagard Healthcare Royalty Partners (“Sagard”). Pursuant to this transaction, we received a $250.0 million payment upon closing in December 2021, in exchange for JEMPERLI royalties due to us on annual commercial sales below $1.0 billion and certain future milestones starting in October 2021. The aggregate JEMPERLI royalties and milestones to be received by Sagard under the Royalty Monetization Agreement is capped at certain fixed multiples of the upfront payment based upon time. For more information about these collaborations, see “— Collaborations”.
Following the closing of the Sagard royalty monetization transaction, we ended 2021 with $615.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments and intend to continue to operate in a capital-efficient manner.
Our Product Candidates
The following table summarizes certain key information about our wholly-owned and partnered product candidates:
COVID-19
We are continuing to proactively monitor and assess the COVID-19 global pandemic. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is inherently uncertain. Our ongoing clinical trials have been, and may continue to be, affected by the closure of offices, or country borders, among other measures being put in place around the world. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices (including but not limited to curtailing or modifying employee travel, moving to full remote work, and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences). While we have begun to re-open our offices, we continue to allow remote work, we continue to monitor developments of the COVID-19 pandemic and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, patients, and business partners. We have implemented appropriate safety measures, following guidance from the Center for Disease Control and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future liquidity and operational performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, including its variants, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, the impact on our clinical trials, patients and collaboration partners, and the effect on our suppliers.
Our Strategy 
We are a leading antibody development company with a pipeline of novel therapeutic antibodies, which is being further expanded by applying our technology platform to emerging biological targets. The key elements of our strategy include: 
•Advancing our wholly-owned lead product candidates to clinical milestones. We are working to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our wholly-owned pipeline programs. We are currently developing three wholly-owned programs to key 2022 milestones, including top-line data from our Phase 2 imsidolimab trials in moderate-to-severe acne and hidradenitis suppurativa in the first and second halves of 2022, respectively, and top-line data from our Phase 1 clinical trial of ANB032 in the first half of 2022.
•Continuing to expand our proprietary pipeline by generating new product candidates using our technology platform. Using our proprietary SHM antibody generation platform, we are able to rapidly develop novel antibodies against biological targets. Our goal is to continue expanding our wholly-owned new therapeutic antibody program pipeline by innovating additional wholly-owned novel pipeline antibodies to potentially first-in-class immune-related targets.
•Identifying emerging opportunities in key therapeutic areas. We intend to remain at the forefront of discovery and development of new therapeutic opportunities in inflammation by understanding and translating biological breakthroughs into first-in-class therapeutic antibodies. Our approach includes translational biology assessments, such as human genetics, ex vivo tissue pathology and target expression patterns, to understand the relevance of emerging targets to patients with unmet medical needs. We plan to leverage this knowledge to create new product candidates and position our current and future programs for initial efficacy assessment. 
•Retaining rights to strategic products in key commercial markets. We intend to retain ownership and control of our pipeline programs to key preclinical and clinical data inflection points. For certain programs, we plan to seek strategic collaborations that provide us with funding, infrastructure and marketing resources to advance through development and commercialization. 
Our Wholly-Owned Product Pipeline
Our most advanced, wholly-owned pipeline programs, imsidolimab, rosnilimab and ANB032, are described below:
Imsidolimab: Anti-IL-36R Antibody
Overview
Imsidolimab is an antibody that inhibits the function of IL-36R, which we are initially developing as a potential first-in-class therapy for multiple inflammation-mediated dermatological patient populations. GPP is a life-threatening, rare systemic inflammatory disorder, with no currently approved therapies. While initial GPP epidemiology studies suggested at least 3,000 patients in the United States, recent medical claims analyses conducted by IQVIA indicate approximately 37,000 unique patients were diagnosed with GPP at least once, and approximately 15,000 unique patients were diagnosed with GPP at least twice, by a physician between 2017 and 2019 using the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) billing code pertaining to GPP (L40.1). Studies have shown that GPP can be associated with mutations in the gene encoding the IL-36R antagonist, or IL-36RA, or can be caused by excessive IL-36 cytokine levels, that lead to abnormally high signaling through the IL-36R and thereby cause the systemic inflammatory condition, GPP. We have obtained FDA Orphan Drug Designation for imsidolimab for the treatment of GPP, and plan to seek Orphan Drug Designation for additional indications in the future. We initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial in GPP, called GEMINI-1, during the third quarter of 2021. We are also developing imsidolimab for moderate-to-severe acne which affects approximately 3 million patients in the United States, for which we anticipate top-line data during the first half of 2022, and moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa affecting approximately 150,000 patients in the United States, for which we anticipate top-line data during the second half of 2022.
IL-36R Target Biology
The IL-36 subfamily of proteins consists of the IL-36 receptor antagonist, or IL-36RA, as well as three cytokines, IL-36 alpha, IL-36 beta and IL-36 gamma, each of which have agonistic characteristics and signal through IL-36R.  These IL-36 proteins are mainly expressed in keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis. The role of the IL-36RA is to dampen the inflammatory effects of IL-36 alpha, IL-36 beta and IL-36 gamma.
Studies have demonstrated the relevance of IL-36 in regulating inflammation in the skin.  Mice over-expressing the IL-36 alpha cytokine undergo a psoriasis-like condition when challenged with an inflammatory stimulus. Additionally, immuno-deficient mice transplanted with human psoriatic skin have been shown to require the IL-36R signaling to maintain disease.
Recent human studies have demonstrated that mutations in the IL-36RA can lead to the occurrence of GPP by dysregulating the IL-36R signaling pathway. However, translational studies that we conducted have also demonstrated that a significant number of GPP patients do not have mutations in the IL-36RA but are likely to have excessive levels of IL-36 cytokines leading to the same disease as patients with mutations. These findings support our hypothesis that IL-36 signaling plays a significant role in GPP.
In addition, studies have demonstrated that humans with genetic mutations that downregulate IL-36 receptor activity are otherwise normal with no specific clinical phenotype.
We believe that imsidolimab has the potential to be the first-in-class therapeutic antibody targeting IL-36R, serving as a therapeutic opportunity for patients with IL-36 signaling mediated inflammatory diseases. Translational studies have indicated that IL-36 signaling is upregulated in GPP, hidradenitis suppurativa and acne.
Imsidolimab Non-Clinical Development
Imsidolimab was generated using our SHM technology platform and has demonstrated high functional potency in blocking human and cynomolgus monkey IL-36 signaling in preclinical studies.
Imsidolimab blocks signal transduction through the human IL-36R and cynomolgus monkey IL-36R by inhibiting the interaction between the receptor and IL-36 alpha, IL-36 beta, and IL-36 gamma cytokines. The high potency and functional activity of imsidolimab for human and cynomolgus monkey IL-36R was measured using standard in vitro assays to determine equilibrium dissociation constant, or KD, and half-maximal inhibitory concentration values, or IC50. Imsidolimab has demonstrated potent KD values of approximately of 71 pM and 209 pM for human IL-36R and cynomolgus monkey IL-36R, respectively. The antibody exhibits high specificity for IL-36R, displaying no detectable binding to related proteins. Functional potency of imsidolimab is at least 100-fold greater than IL-36RA in human systems, which is measured as the IC50 of inhibition of interleukin-8, or IL-8, release from human keratinocytes.
Imsidolimab functional activity has been demonstrated through inhibition of IL-8 secretion from human primary keratinocytes when stimulated by IL-36 gamma of approximately 0.15 nM and 1.2 nM, respectively. Lower KD and IC50 values indicate higher potency and functional activity, respectively. Similar IC50 values were observed in those same preclinical studies when keratinocytes were stimulated with IL-36 alpha or beta.
To date, we have demonstrated that the half-life of imsidolimab in cynomolgus monkeys is more than nine days. Imsidolimab is well-expressed from Chinese hamster ovary cells, or CHO cells, and is readily purified using standard methodologies. In addition, the antibody retained full functional activity when incubated in normal human serum at 37 °C for one week.
Clinical Development Plan
We have completed, under an approved Clinical Trial Notification, or CTN, a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers for which we announced positive top-line results from an interim analysis of this clinical trial and subsequently presented completed data from this clinical trial at the 2018 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Congress. In the double-blinded, placebo-controlled healthy volunteer Phase 1 clinical trial, 36 subjects were administered a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose of imsidolimab ranging between 10 mg and 750 mg, 18 subjects were administered multiple ascending doses of imsidolimab intravenously ranging between 40 mg and 300 mg weekly for four consecutive weeks and 18 subjects were dosed with placebo. Imsidolimab was well-tolerated by all subjects, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events observed in the single ascending dose cohorts were upper respiratory tract infections in 10 of 36 (28%) subjects dosed with imsidolimab versus six of 12 (50%) subjects dosed with placebo and headache in 10 of 36 (28%) subjects dosed with imsidolimab versus three of 12 (25%) subjects dosed with placebo. In the multiple ascending dose cohorts, the most frequent treatment-emerging adverse events observed were headache in seven of 18 (39%) subjects dosed with imsidolimab versus one of six (17%) subjects dosed with placebo. No serious adverse events were reported among any subjects in the clinical trial. The in vivo half-life of imsidolimab was approximately 28 days for both subcutaneous and intravenous routes of administration, with bioavailability of approximately 90 percent. A single dose of imsidolimab at certain dose levels was able to completely suppress IL-36 cytokine function for 85 days, as measured by IL-36 cytokine-mediated release of IL-8 using an ex vivo pharmacodynamic assay. The favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties of imsidolimab and other results demonstrated by this Phase 1 clinical trial supported advancement of imsidolimab into Phase 2 studies. 
We completed an open-label, multi-dose, single-arm Phase 2 clinical trial of imsidolimab in 8 GPP patients, also referred to as the GALLOP clinical trial, where top-line data through week 16 was presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology (EADV) Congress on October 2, 2021. In this trial 6 of 8 (75%) patients treated with imsidolimab monotherapy achieved the primary endpoint of response on the clinical global impression (“CGI”) scale at week 4 and week 16, without requiring rescue medication. Two of 8 (25%) patients were considered to have not met the primary endpoint because they dropped out of the clinical trial prior to Day 29. The modified Japanese Dermatology Association Severity Index (“mJDA-SI”) score, which incorporates both dermatological and systemic aspects of GPP, decreased for patients on average by 29% at week 1, 54% at week 4 and 58% at week 16. Erythema with skin pustules, which clinically defines GPP, decreased by 60% at week 1 and 94% by week 4 and 98% by week 16. Patients achieved a reduction in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), which is a patient-reported measure, of 6 points at week 4 and 11 points by week 16, each of which exceeded the minimal clinically importance difference (MCID) of 4 points. GPP Physician Global Assessment (GPPPGA) scale was implemented by protocol amendment during the course of the trial and was assessed in 4 of the 8 enrolled patients, where zero (clear) or 1 (almost clear) response was achieved in 2 (50%) patients at week 4 and 3 (75%) at week 16. Genotypic testing 
indicated homozygous wild-type IL-36RN, CARD14 and AP1S3 alleles for all 8 patients. Through week 16, anti-drug antibodies were only detected in one patient, which occurred at week 12 and did not impact imsidolimab pharmacokinetics or efficacy. Imsidolimab was generally well-tolerated, and most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and resolved without sequelae. No infusion or injection site reactions were observed. One patient dropped out of the clinical trial due to a diagnosis of Staphylococcal aureus bacteremia in the first week, which was a serious adverse event deemed to be possibly drug-related. Because the patient was symptomatic prior to dosing and had a prior medical history of bacteremia, a common comorbidity of GPP, we do not believe this event is likely attributable to imsidolimab. Another patient dropped out of the study on Day 22 due to investigator reported inadequate efficacy. One patient contracted COVID-19 during the course of the clinical trial, which was deemed a serious adverse event unrelated to imsidolimab, and did not lead to study discontinuation. Data from the first two patients to have completed the Day 113 treatment period under this clinical trial, which we announced in September 2019, indicated sustained efficacy in these two patients through Day 113. We met with the FDA during the fourth quarter of 2020 to review an orphan disease registration plan for imsidolimab for the treatment of GPP and have initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial during the third quarter of 2021 following completion of protocol alignment and review of 16-week data from the GALLOP clinical trial by the FDA.
In July 2020, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for imsidolimab for the treatment of patients with GPP. GPP is a chronic, life-threatening, rare disease with no currently approved therapies. GPP is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by the development of widespread pustules marked by idiopathic exacerbations. In severe cases, GPP patients can die from cardio-pulmonary failure, exhaustion, toxicity and/or infection subsequent to occurrences of pustular flares. Patients with GPP suffer without robust therapeutic options because currently approved psoriasis management therapies have not demonstrated clear efficacy in the treatment of this condition. While initial GPP epidemiology studies suggested at least 3,000 patients in the United States, recent medical claims analyses conducted by IQVIA indicate approximately 37,000 unique patients were diagnosed with GPP at least once, and approximately 15,000 unique patients were diagnosed with GPP at least twice, by a physician between 2017 and 2019 using the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) billing code pertaining to GPP (L40.1). 
We have initiated a global registry of GPP patients, also referred to as the RADIANCE study, which we anticipate will improve understanding of the patient journey in these two indications and assist in enrollment of future GPP clinical trials.
We are conducting clinical development of imsidolimab in moderate-to-severe acne. Acne is the most common skin disorder in the United States, with approximately 3 million patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe disease. Moderate-to-severe acne typically presents with painful papules, pustules, nodules, cysts and scarring. A key contributing factor to the pathogenesis of acne is the immune response to Propionibacterium acnes, or p. acnes, which is associated with upregulated IL-36 cytokine activity, localized inflammation and neutrophil infiltration of the skin. Existing therapies, including isotretinoin and systemic antibiotics, provide variable efficacy for moderate-to-severe acne patients and have practical limitations to their use given potential for clinically meaningful side effects. We are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of imsidolimab, called ACORN, where 120 patients will be randomized equally between two dose levels of imsidolimab and placebo, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne, and we anticipate top-line date during the first half of 2022.
We are conducting clinical development of imsidolimab in hidradenitis suppurativa, also known as acne inversa, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by painful nodules in intertriginous areas that can progress to abscesses, sinus tracks and scarring. Current treatment options for hidradenitis suppurativa, including antibiotics, corticosteroids and anti-TNF therapy, have variable efficacy in moderate-to-severe patients, which often leads to surgery for removal of hidradenitis suppurativa nodules. Human translational studies have demonstrated elevated IL-36 cytokine expression in hidradenitis suppurativa skin biopsies, and we believe treatment of moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa with imsidolimab may lead to therapeutic benefit for this patient population. Moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa affects approximately 150,000 adults in the United States. We are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of imsidolimab in moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa, called HARP, where 120 patients will be randomized equally between two dose levels of imsidolimab and placebo, and we anticipate top-line data during the second half of 2022.
As described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report, the clinical development of drug product candidates is subject to a wide range of risks and uncertainties, any of which could cause our actual development strategy or timeframes to vary.
Checkpoint Receptor Modulator Programs
We are developing anti-inflammatory checkpoint receptor antibodies to PD-1 and BTLA, each of which are genetically associated with inflammatory disease when dysregulated in humans. 
Rosnilimab is an antibody that binds PD-1 in an agonistic manner, leading to reduced T cell activity and anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. PD-1 is a key inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor expressed by activated T cells. PD-1 activity contributes to downregulation of T cell mediated immune responses in healthy individuals. We believe insufficient PD-1 activity may be a key biological defect associated with human inflammatory diseases. According to a 2007 study, genetic mutations in the PD-1 pathway are associated with increased susceptibility to various inflammatory conditions. We hypothesize that augmenting PD-1 signaling by rosnilimab treatment has the potential to broadly suppress human inflammatory diseases. Rosnilimab was developed using our proprietary antibody discovery platform. We believe PD-1 agonist antibodies are challenging to discover due to the unique binding properties required to augment signaling through checkpoint receptors. Rosnilimab has been preclinically tested for key pharmacological properties (including binding potency, functional activity, epitope specificity, in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics) and manufacturability attributes (including expression and stability). Through translational biology, we plan to focus the clinical development of rosnilimab upon certain human autoimmune diseases where PD-1 checkpoint receptor function may be under-represented. We presented preclinical data for rosnilimab at the Festival of Biologics Annual Meeting in March 2020, including translational data demonstrating in vitro activity of rosnilimab in alopecia areata patient samples.
We announced positive top-line data from a healthy volunteer Phase 1 clinical trial of rosnilimab in November 2021. A total of 144 subjects were enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled healthy volunteer Phase 1 trial, where single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts were administered single subcutaneous or intravenous doses of rosnilimab ranging between 0.02mg to 600mg or placebo, while multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts received four weekly subcutaneous doses of rosnilimab ranging between 60mg and 400mg or placebo. Dose escalation was conducted subsequent to data safety monitoring board review of safety and tolerability parameters following each single and multiple ascending dose level. Rosnilimab was generally well-tolerated and no dose limiting toxicities were observed. The most frequent adverse event reported among SAD cohorts was increased circulating C-reactive protein levels of mild severity in nine (10%) rosnilimab-dosed subjects occurring sporadically in a dose-independent manner and a severe occurrence in one (3.3%) placebo-dosed subject. MAD cohorts reported headache as the most frequent adverse event with mild occurrences in three (12.5%) rosnilimab-dosed subjects and none in placebo subjects. Mild injection site reactions were observed in two subjects (11.1%) administered with multiple subcutaneous rosnilimab doses. Two serious adverse events were reported in single dose cohorts, including obstructive pancreatitis in a placebo-dosed subject and COVID-19 infection in a rosnilimab-dosed subject leading to discontinuation which was deemed unrelated to treatment. No serious adverse events were reported in subjects receiving multiple doses of rosnilimab or placebo.
Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated a favorable profile for rosnilimab with an estimated two-week half-life for subcutaneous and intravenous routes of administration and approximately 80% bioavailability. Low-titer anti-drug antibodies were detected at low single dose levels in 19 (21%) rosnilimab-dosed subjects, but none were detected in high single dose or multiple dose subjects. Full PD-1 receptor occupancy was observed rapidly during the first week following single subcutaneous rosnilimab doses at or above 60mg, and was maintained for at least 30 days at or above 200mg single subcutaneous doses. These data support monthly subcutaneous dosing of rosnilimab for future patient trials. Rosnilimab’s pharmacodynamic activity resulted in rapid and sustained reduction in the quantity and functional activity of PD-1+ T cells, which are known to be pathogenic drivers of inflammatory diseases. Conventional T (Tcon) cells (CD3+, CD25 low) expressing PD-1, which represented approximately 25% of peripheral T cells at baseline, were reduced by 50%, including in both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, in a dose-dependent manner and in correlation with receptor occupancy. This effect was maximized on high-PD-1 expressing Tcon cells, which represented approximately 5% of peripheral T cells, with 90% reduction relative to baseline. Conversely, total T cells (CD3+), total Tcon cells (CD3+, CD25low) and total regulatory T (Treg) cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD25 bright, CD127-) were unchanged (<5% change from baseline), resulting in a favorable shift in the ratio of PD-1+ Tcon cells to total Treg cells post-treatment. No effect (<5% reduction from baseline) was observed on any of the aforementioned cell types in placebo-dosed subjects. In addition, an antigen-specific functional T cell recall response, measured as ex vivo interferon-gamma released in response to tetanus toxoid challenge, was inhibited in a receptor occupancy dependent manner and was consistent with the observed reduction of PD-1+ Tcon cells, to a maximum of approximately 90% relative to baseline within 30 days following single rosnilimab dose, while placebo administration had no effect. Based upon these data, we believe rosnilimab’s in vivo mechanism has the potential to treat T-cell driven human inflammatory diseases. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated AZURE, a randomized placebo-controlled 45-patient Phase 2 trial of rosnilimab in moderate-to-severe alopecia areata patients with at least 50% scalp hair loss for at least 6 months prior to enrollment, where the primary endpoint is change in severity of alopecia tool (SALT) relative to baseline. We continue to assess clinical development opportunities for rosnilimab in additional indications, including vitiligo and rheumatoid arthritis, and will make decisions pending additional data. 
ANB032 is an antibody that modulates BTLA in a manner that results in anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. BTLA is broadly expressed upon lymphoid (including T and B) cells and myeloid cells (including dendritic cells) and therefore involved in a spectrum of inflammatory responses. We believe that the binding of BTLA with LIGHT, a receptor also known as TSFSR14, results in pro-inflammatory signaling across various immune cells, and that stabilization of BTLA’s binding to 
HVEM, which is mediated by ANB032 treatment, leads to an anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. Genetic studies have demonstrated that dysregulated BTLA signaling, which favors pro-inflammatory activity, is associated with certain human inflammatory diseases (Lin et al. J Biomed Sci. 2006). ANB032 has demonstrated in vivo efficacy in an animal disease model.
We are conducting a healthy volunteer Phase 1 trial of ANB032, under an Australian Clinical Trial Notification (“CTN”), and anticipate top-line data from this trial during the first half of 2022. We presented preclinical data regarding ANB032 at the 2020 Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies (FOCIS) Virtual Annual Meeting in October 2020.
Our SHM Antibody Discovery Platform
Antibody Overview
Antibodies are complex proteins naturally generated by the immune system to neutralize foreign pathogens such as bacteria or viruses. B cells, a white blood cell type responsible for the generation of antibodies in response to pathogens, secrete billions of antibodies with different specificities into the bloodstream. Antibodies are structurally distinct Y-shaped proteins formed through the combination of two long proteins, called heavy chains, and two short proteins, called light chains. Each heavy and light chain pair forms a binding site where the antibody specifically binds its target, otherwise known as an antigen, at the Fab domain of the antibody molecule. The specificity of each antibody to a target, and the potency of its binding strength to that target are defined by the amino acid sequences of heavy and light chains in the Fab domain of the antibody molecule. The other end of the antibody, called the Fc domain, is responsible for communication between the antibody and the rest of the immune system. Fc domains bind to various receptors and cause immune system effector responses.
Therapeutic antibodies are typically non-naturally occurring, or recombinant, antibodies specifically developed to treat human diseases by binding to certain proteins, and thereby modulating key biological processes. Therapeutic antibodies are injectable products that are typically dosed subcutaneously or intravenously, unlike synthetic chemistry-based “small molecule” therapeutics that may also be administered orally. Therapeutic antibodies have the following key features that we believe make them more predictable than small molecules:
•Target Specificity.  Due to the large size and complex nature of the antibody Fab domain, antibodies generally bind with high specificity to the desired therapeutic target and tend to exhibit less off-target binding to unrelated proteins, which lowers the risk of unintended biological side effects such as toxicity.
•Pharmacokinetics and Dosing Frequency.  As complex proteins, antibodies are metabolized and distributed differently than small molecules. Full length antibodies tend to exhibit serum half-lives of seven to 24 days in humans, leading to bi-weekly or monthly dosing as typical practice for therapeutic antibodies.
•Potency and Dose Quantities.  Antibodies are typically highly potent in binding to their desired target, with binding dissociation constants in the low nanomolar to picomolar range. Hence, antibodies tend to be dosed at low amounts (less than 1 gram quantities per course of therapy).
We believe that therapeutic antibodies can be significantly de-risked pre-clinically for specificity, toxicology and pharmacokinetics, which is not generally true for small molecule drugs.
Limitations of Competing Antibody Technologies
Despite the promise of antibodies as a therapeutic modality, historically it has been difficult and time consuming to generate therapeutic-grade antibodies utilizing competing antibody discovery technologies. Such technologies have relied primarily on mouse immunization methodologies (such as wild-type or engineered mice), microbial antibody display libraries (such as phage or yeast cell display) or human B cell screening to generate antibodies against therapeutic targets of interest. We believe the key limitations of these competitive approaches include:
•Insufficient Diversity.  Each of the prior technologies has limited, and often static, diversity of antibodies available for selection. The number of therapeutic targets that can be addressed by the available antibodies is therefore limited. It is particularly difficult for mouse immunization approaches to identify therapeutics against conserved proteins that are homologous between human and mouse species;
•Lack of Functional Activity Selection.  Competing technologies have not been able to drive antibody selection on the basis of functional activity. Even if antibodies are available against a certain target, they may not bind the correct region or epitope of the protein to achieve the intended functional therapeutic effects;
•Low Potency.  Antibodies from competing technologies tend to demonstrate low binding potencies against their targets. Such incomplete binding may not result in therapeutic effect that is sufficient to change disease outcomes, or require impractically high doses to convey therapeutic benefit; and
•Unpredictable Manufacturing Properties.  Using microbial display systems such as phage and yeast display libraries has resulted in unpredictable expression, stability and formulation when manufacturing is initiated using mammalian cells, thus leading to poor production yields and product stability.
Mouse immunization methodologies.  Mouse immunization methodologies involve the administration of human target antigen to mice with wild-type or engineered immune systems, with the assumption that their immune systems will generate antibodies with sufficient potency against the desired human antigen epitope to convey biological effect. A key limitation of this approach is that when the mouse is dosed with an antigen that is similar in the human and mouse, the antigen is seen by the mouse immune system as one of its own proteins, and very few, if any, antibodies are generated. In addition, the mouse immune system often generates mouse antibodies to epitopes that are not therapeutically relevant to humans, leading the resulting antibodies to bind the human target but failing to convey therapeutic effect.
Microbial antibody display systems.  Microbial antibody display systems require screening of antibodies, typically formatted as antibody fragments, from a static library diversity displayed on a bacterial or yeast microbial cell surface. The static nature of these libraries limits the range of antibody specificities to values around 10 or 10, which is generally insufficient to avail high-affinity antibodies against many antigens. This can lead to suboptimal potency and subsequently require phage/yeast antibodies to be matured significantly, typically with random mutagenesis, to obtain therapeutic level potencies, which is a labor-intensive and inefficient process. In addition, antibodies selected using this approach are expressed through the microbial cell expression machinery, which differs significantly in terms of manufacturability (expression level, glycosylation, formulation and stability) from mammalian cell expression typically utilized for clinical and commercial manufacturing of therapeutic antibodies. Such differences typically lead to difficulties in mammalian cell manufacturing of microbial display-derived antibodies.
Human B cell screening methodologies.  Human B cell screening methodologies involve the screening and isolation of antibodies from peripheral human blood against therapeutic antigens of interest. The key limitation of this approach is that circulating human B cells generally do not develop antibodies against endogenous proteins because their function is to develop humoral immunity against foreign pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses. Therefore, it is challenging to obtain therapeutic antibodies against human antigens through this approach.
Our Technology Solution
Our innovative platform is designed to replicate the natural process of SHM embedded within the human immune system to rapidly develop a diverse range of therapeutic-grade antibodies in vitro. SHM is a critical, endogenous process that generates the essential antibody diversity required to develop a natural immune response to pathogens. Human genomes encode a limited number of antibody genes, which are insufficient to generate antibodies against the wide variety of foreign pathogens encountered from the external environment. SHM enables the human immune system to expand the limited diversity encoded within human genomes to the billions of antibody specificities required to defend against external pathogens.
The key enzyme required for SHM is called activation-induced cytidine deaminase, or AID. AID has been genetically conserved throughout mammalian biology and is required for the non-random mutagenesis pattern associated with SHM. AID is specifically expressed by B cells after contact with a foreign pathogen and modifies antibody sequences in a non-random fashion. Through SHM, B cells evolve antibodies with the potency and specificity required to clear the foreign pathogen. However, within the in vivo environment, SHM does not generally progress to the creation of high potency antibodies or develop antibodies against the body’s own proteins.
By coupling in vitro SHM with our mammalian cell system that simultaneously displays and secretes antibodies, we believe SHM is able to rapidly identify and mature antibodies with desired functional activity to high potency while simultaneously mitigating the risks associated with manufacturing. We introduce AID into mammalian cells to replicate the non-random mutagenesis SHM pattern observed within B cells in vivo. Starting with a library of either fully-human or humanized antibodies, our platform generates AID-based variants of the starting antibody library throughout the process. We have demonstrated that the pattern of mutagenesis we observe in vitro using our platform technology closely mimics the pattern observed among in vivo generated antibodies, thereby increasing confidence that antibodies generated by our platform will be tolerated when used as therapeutic drugs in humans.
By selecting antibodies based on their antigen binding from the broad antibody library population SHM develops, we are able to evolve in an iterative fashion the binding potency and function of antibodies to levels that we believe will be required for therapeutic use. We believe this approach allows us to rapidly generate antibodies with high binding potency against a target. Through this approach, we have successfully generated therapeutic antibody product candidates to more than 25 targets, including targets that we believe have been challenging for competing antibody technology platforms to generate.
Each evolving antibody is expressed within the SHM-active mammalian cell to concurrently display the evolved antibody on the cell surface to permit cell sorting selection for potency properties while the same antibody is secreted into the extracellular media at sufficient quantities to permit functional assays to be conducted. In this manner, the evolving antibodies 
expressed by each transfected cell are assessed in a high-throughput fashion for the desired functional activity relevant to the therapeutic mechanism.
We believe our antibody discovery platform, as described above, has the following advantages over competing approaches:
•Diversity against difficult targets.  We are able to generate an unprecedented diversity of antibodies by applying SHM-based diversification outside of the constraints of an in vivo environment. This enables us to develop antibodies against human targets that we believe have not otherwise been accessible to prior technologies.
•High potency.  Because our platform generates highly-potent antibodies, we are potentially able to modulate every extracellular target associated with human disease, and believe only small therapeutic doses may be required to mediate therapeutic effect in vivo.
•Functional activity selection.  Our mammalian cell system simultaneously displays and secretes antibodies during the antibody discovery process, allowing us to incorporate functional assays throughout the process and focus on producing product candidates that are optimized for the desired therapeutic activity.
•Speed.  Our platform technology has enabled us to generate therapeutic-grade antibodies and initiate subsequent preclinical manufacturing and toxicology studies, typically in less than 12 months. We believe this timeline is significantly shorter than conventional approaches based upon mouse immunization and microbial display systems.
•Manufacturability.  By utilizing our mammalian cell display system, we believe our approach increases the probability of success in manufacturing and commercialization by mitigating the risks associated with antibody expression, formulation and stability during the antibody generation process.
Collaborations
GlaxoSmithKline
In March 2014, we entered into a Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement (the “GSK Agreement”) with TESARO, Inc. (“Tesaro”), an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company now a part of GlaxoSmithKline (Tesaro and GlaxoSmithKline are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as “GSK”). We executed an amendment in November 2014 to add an additional dual-reactive antibody product candidate. Under the terms of the GSK Agreement, as amended, we granted GSK an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell products based on our proprietary technology for the discovery, generation and optimization of certain specified immunotherapy antibodies. We have granted GSK exclusive rights to three monospecific antibody product candidates targeting TIM-3 (TSR-022), LAG-3 (TSR-033) and PD-1 (TSR-042) and a bispecific antibody product candidates targeting PD-1 and LAG-3. Under the GSK Agreement, as amended, we are responsible for performing initial discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies with the goal of generating immunotherapy antibodies for use in the treatment of cancer. GSK is responsible for all subsequent preclinical, clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and other activities necessary to develop and commercialize antibodies selected under each of six development programs, and GSK is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop and commercialize at least one product to each of the four targets. During the term, other than under the collaboration, and except as amended by the October 23, 2020 amendment of the GSK Agreement (described below), both GSK and we are prohibited from developing and commercializing, independently or with a third party, any agents targeting LAG-3, PD-1 or TIM- 3, as single agents or in combination with other therapies. We completed our responsibilities under the terms of the GSK Agreement as of December 31, 2016 to generate and develop antibodies to certain defined stages of preclinical development. 
Under the terms of the GSK Agreement, as amended, GSK made up-front, non-creditable and non-refundable cash payments aggregating $19.0 million to us during 2014. GSK was also required to reimburse us on a quarterly basis for specified costs incurred by us in our initial discovery and development activities covered by the agreement. For each of the targets for which GSK is granted exclusive rights, GSK is required to make milestone payments to us of up to $18.0 million if certain research and development milestone events are achieved, up to an additional $90.0 million of milestone payments if certain U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory submissions and approvals occur in initial and subsequent indications, and up to an additional $165.0 million upon the achievement of specified levels of annual worldwide net sales. GSK will also be required to pay us tiered royalties ranging from 4% to 8%, for each product developed under the agreement, except in the case of dostarlimab where the royalties payable will be 8% to 25% (as explained in more detail below in connection with the October 23, 2020 amendment of the GSK Agreement), on a product- by-product basis, on worldwide annual net sales, and additional commercial milestone payments if specified levels of annual net sales of a product are attained.
On October 23, 2020, we again amended the GSK Agreement (the “2020 Amendment”). Under the 2020 Amendment, we agreed to permit GSK to conduct development and commercialization of Zejula in combination with any third-party molecules. Zejula is an oral, once-daily poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, which has received U.S. approval for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, has been approved for certain other indications, and is under development for additional cancer indications as well. In addition, under the 2020 Amendment, we were granted increased royalties upon sales of dostarlimab, an anti-PD-1 antagonist antibody under development by GSK for multiple oncological disorders, including endometrial cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer and mismatch repair deficient solid tumors, equal to 8% of Net Sales (as defined in the GSK Agreement) below $1.0 billion and from 12% up to 25% of Net Sales above $1.0 billion. The 2020 Amendment also provided for a one-time non-refundable cash payment of $60.0 million that we received in the fourth quarter of 2020. GSK also agreed, starting January 1, 2021, to pay us a 1% royalty on all GSK Net Sales of Zejula. The $1.1 billion in cash milestone payments due under the GSK Agreement remain unchanged. Additionally, under the terms of the 2020 Amendment, GSK has agreed to certain diligence commitments with respect to the future development of dostarlimab, and the parties have agreed to review such commitments under regular joint review committee meetings going forward.
This GSK Agreement, as amended, expires when no further payments are due to us, unless earlier terminated. Either party may terminate the GSK Agreement, as amended, in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. GSK may terminate the GSK Agreement, as amended, at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice to us.
In October 2021, we signed the Royalty Monetization Agreement with Sagard. Pursuant to this transaction, we received a $250.0 million payment upon closing in December 2021, in exchange for JEMPERLI royalties due to us on annual commercial sales below $1.0 billion and certain future milestones starting in October 2021. The aggregate JEMPERLI royalties and milestones to be received by Sagard under the Royalty Monetization Agreement is capped at certain fixed multiples of the upfront payment based upon time. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb
In December 2011, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the “BMS Agreement”) with Celgene, now a part of Bristol-Myers Squibb (Celgene and Bristol-Myers Squibb are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as “BMS”), to develop therapeutic antibodies against multiple targets. We completed our responsibilities under the terms of the BMS Agreement to generate antibodies against various mutually agreed biological targets during fiscal 2014. On a target-by-target basis, we provided BMS an option to obtain rights to develop and commercialize a defined number of antibodies against each target. We were successful in generating antibodies against multiple targets and BMS has exercised its option with respect to antibodies against three targets. BMS is currently advancing two anti-inflammatory antibodies, of which an anti-PD-1 agonist antibody, also known as CC-90006, is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial, while the other program is currently in preclinical development.
Upon execution of the BMS Agreement in 2011, BMS paid us a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable initial fee of $6.0 million. BMS has reimbursed us for specified research costs in accordance with the research plans. BMS is also obligated, on a project-by-project basis, to pay us up to a total of an additional $18.0 million if certain research and development milestone events are achieved under such project and up to a total of an additional $35.0 million if certain regulatory milestone events are achieved under such project. BMS will also be required to pay us single digit royalties on net sales of products containing the delivered antibodies on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last patent right that covers manufacture, use or sale of such product in such country, and in any case at least 10 years after the first commercial sale of the product in such country.
The BMS Agreement continues until our royalty rights on any BMS product resulting from the collaboration expire, which period will last at least ten years after any such product first goes to market. Either we or BMS may terminate the BMS Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. 
In-Licensing Agreements License Agreement with UKRI 
In 2006, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with the Medical Research Council, which has subsequently been acquired by United Kingdom Research and Innovation, or UKRI, to obtain rights to multiple patents and patent applications relating to fundamental discoveries with respect to SHM and AID by Dr. Michael Neuberger and his colleagues. We since amended this license agreement to include additional subject matter and reflect the change in ownership. Under the terms of the agreement, or the UKRI Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sub-licensable license under specified patent rights to manufacture, use, sell and commercialize products and methods covered by such patents for all fields of use. We are responsible for prosecution of the licensed patents and the development of therapeutic products covered by the intellectual property. We are obligated to research and develop licensed methods and licensed products for the 
purpose of commercializing such methods and products at least as diligently as we research and develop our other products of similar market potential and stages of development.
We are responsible for paying UKRI an annual fee of $55,000. Additionally, for each product developed and commercialized under the UKRI Agreement, we are obligated to pay UKRI up to an additional $175,000 upon the achievement of specified development milestone events and up to an additional $275,000 upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestone events. In addition, we owe UKRI royalties at 0.25% of annual net sales for worldwide sales on a product-by-product at or below $750.0 million and 1% of annual net sales of products worldwide above $750.0 million, payable on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last licensed patent covering such product in such country. Under this license agreement, we have rights to 14 patents worldwide as of December 31, 2021.
Unless earlier terminated, the UKRI Agreement will expire upon expiration of all royalty payment obligations under the UKRI Agreement. Either party may terminate the UKRI Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or upon the occurrence of specified bankruptcy events for the other party. We may terminate the UKRI Agreement upon 60 days’ notice to UKRI.
License Agreement with Millipore
In May 2009, we signed a non-exclusive research and commercial license agreement with Millipore Corporation, or Millipore, to obtain a non-exclusive license to patents and patent applications directed to the ubiquitous chromatin opening elements technology for the expression of proteins, particularly antibodies, generated by us, which license may be sublicensed to our contractors and partners. Under the terms of the agreement, or the Millipore Agreement, we are obligated to pay Millipore $87,500 in annual license fees, adjusted annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index. Additionally, for each product developed and commercialized under the Millipore Agreement, we are obligated to pay Millipore up to an additional $750,000 upon the achievement of specified development milestone events and up to an additional $4.4 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestone events. We do not owe Millipore any royalties on net sales of products commercialized under the Millipore Agreement.
Unless affirmatively terminated by one of the parties, the Millipore Agreement will continue in effect. Either party may terminate the Millipore Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. We may terminate the Millipore Agreement upon 90 days’ notice to Millipore.
Australian Operations
In March 2015, we established a wholly-owned Australian subsidiary called AnaptysBio Pty Ltd, in order to conduct various preclinical and clinical activities for etokimab and imsidolimab. By establishing operations in Australia, we are able to access an established network of manufacturing and clinical development support contractors located in Australia and benefit from Australia’s streamlined approval processes for the initiation of first-in human studies. We have few employees with experience advancing product candidates through the Australian regulatory review process and have therefore engaged Australian consultants with expertise in the regulatory requirements and clinical development of therapeutic products in Australia. We are also working with established manufacturing and clinical development support contractors located in Australia, who are familiar with Australian regulatory and product development processes.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our technology platform, product candidates, novel biological discoveries, epitopes, new therapeutic approaches and potential indications, and other inventions that are important to our business. In total, our patent portfolio, including patents to our technology platform licensed from UKRI, as well as patents co-owned with GSK consisted of approximately 66 issued patents and 101 pending patent applications as of December 31, 2021.
For our product candidates, generally we initially pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter including antibody sequences, methods of use, and methods of production. Throughout the development of our product candidates, we seek to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success.

Patents that may issue from our pending applications would provide protection until November 2037.
GSK4074386
As of December 31, 2021, we owned or co-owned 36 patents and patent applications in various countries directed to the antibody sequence of GSK4074386, an anti-LAG-3 antagonist, and its variants, methods of use and related matters. We intend to prosecute our pending applications and pursue patent issuance and protection in key commercial markets where significant product sales may occur. Patents that may issue from our pending applications would provide protection until April 2038.
Platform Technology
Our platform technology is covered by U.S. and foreign issued patents, emanating from our in-licensed portfolio and wholly-owned portfolio, in various jurisdictions.
Our portfolio includes patents directed to platform technology related inventions associated with antibody library design, antibody humanization, mammalian cell display and secretion, and other technical attributes relating to the discovery, maturation and optimization of antibodies using our technology platform. Patents relating to our platform technology that have been issued to date provide protection through May 2033.
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates or for our technology platform. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application related to the patent. A U.S. patent also may be accorded a patent term adjustment, or PTA, under certain circumstances to compensate for delays in obtaining the patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. In some instances, such a PTA may result in a U.S. patent term extending beyond 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application related to the U.S. patent. In addition, the term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the 
FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
We also rely on trade secrets relating to our technology platform and product candidates and seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets.  
It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property.
Manufacturing
We must manufacture drug product for clinical trial use in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our product candidates must meet cGMP requirements and FDA satisfaction before any product is approved and we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers will also be subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
Our internal manufacturing capabilities include non-cGMP antibody and reagent production using small scale quantities for characterization and in vitro and in vivo preclinical assessment of product candidates. We do not have and we do not currently plan to acquire or develop the facilities or capabilities to manufacture cGMP drug substance or filled drug product for use in human clinical trials.
We rely on third-party manufacturers to generate cGMP-grade cell lines and will rely on them to produce cGMP drug product required for our planned clinical trials, and we expect to continue to rely on third parties to manufacture clinical trial drug supplies for the foreseeable future. We also contract with additional third parties for the filling, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of investigational drug products. We have personnel with significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality, including cGMP, and project management experience to oversee our third-party manufacturers and to manage manufacturing and quality data and information for regulatory compliance purposes. While our contract manufacturers have not yet produced commercially-approved cGMP batches of our product candidates, they have previously manufactured products for other companies in compliance with cGMP and have been previously inspected by regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP standards. Similarly, our personnel have had experience with cGMP at previous positions.
Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of our products. Contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by continuing technological advancement and significant competition. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products and the ease of use and effectiveness of any companion diagnostics. The level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Specifically, there are several companies developing or marketing treatments that may be approved for the same indications and/or diseases as our product candidates, including major pharmaceutical companies. 
For GPP, our competitors include marketed therapies such as secukinumab (Cosentyx; Novartis), which binds IL-17A; ustekinumab (Stelara; Janssen), which blocks IL-12 and 23 cytokine function; and acitretin (Soriatane; GSK), as well as therapies in development such as guselkumab (Janssen), which blocks IL-23 cytokine function, gevokizumab (Xoma 052) and canakinumab (Ilaris, Novartis), which binds IL-1 beta, anakinra (Kineret; Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB), a recombinant form of the IL-1 receptor antagonist,an anti-IL-36 receptor antibody called spesolimab or BI-655130 (Boehringer Ingelheim) and an anti-IL-36 receptor antibody called REGN6490 (Regeneron).
For acne, our competitors include retinoids and retinoid-like drugs, including tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage), antibiotics including clindamycin (Benzaclin, Duac) and erythromycin (Benzamycin) and isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis, Accutane) and oral antibiotics including sarecycline (Seysara).
For hidradenitis suppurativa, our competitors include adalimumab (Humira; Abbvie) which is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa for patients 12 years of age or older.
For our PD-1 agonist antibody program, our competitors include CC-90006 (BMS), which is an anti-PD-1 agonist antibody developed under our partnership with BMS, a BTLA modulator antibody called LY3361237 being developed by Eli Lilly, a PD-1 agonist antibody called LY3462817 also being developed by Eli Lilly, a PD-1 agonist antibody called JNJ-67484703 (Janssen), two PD-1 agonist antibodies called PT627 and PT001 being developed by Pandion Therapeutics, which has been acquired by Merck and a PD-1 agonist antibody under preclinical development by MiroBio. Our competitors in moderate-to-severe alopecia areata include topical and oral corticosteroids, topical immunotherapy (diphencyprone, dinitrochlorobenzene, squaric acid dibutyl ester), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus), prostaglandins and janus kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, rixolitinib) currently in development. Our BTLA agonist antibody program competitors include LY3361237 (Lilly) which has demonstrated efficacy in treatment of systemic lupus erythematous as measured by the cutaneous lupus erythematosus disease area and severity index (CLASI), and a preclinical antibody under development at MiroBio. 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA approval process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, 
post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of new drug applications, or NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Biological product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence in the United States, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA premarket approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices, or GLPs. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practices, or GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks.  If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the biologic. A single Phase 3 clinical trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (i) where the clinical trial is a large multicenter clinical trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second clinical trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (ii) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence.
After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently 
complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologic products are reviewed within 10 months of the date the BLA is filed with the FDA; most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within six months of the date the BLA is filed with the FDA. Priority review can be applied to a biologic that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure, potent and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter.  A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU.  ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.
Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.
Foreign clinical studies to support an IND
The FDA will accept as support for an IND a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign clinical study if it was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary. A sponsor or applicant who wishes to rely on a non-IND foreign clinical study to support an IND must submit the following supporting information to the FDA to demonstrate that the study conformed to GCP:
•the investigator’s qualifications;
•a description of the research facilities;
•a detailed summary of the protocol and study results and, if requested, case records or additional background data;
•a description of the drug substance and drug product, including the components, formulation, specifications, and, if available, the bioavailability of the drug product;
•information showing that the study is adequate and well controlled;
•the name and address of the independent ethics committee that reviewed the study and a statement that the independent ethics committee meets the required definition;
•a summary of the independent ethics committee’s decision to approve or modify and approve the study, or to provide a favorable opinion;
•a description of how informed consent was obtained;
•a description of what incentives, if any, were provided to subjects to participate;
•a description of how the sponsors monitored the study and ensured that the study was consistent with the protocol;
•a description of how investigators were trained to comply with GCP and to conduct the study in accordance with the study protocol; and
•a statement on whether written commitments by investigators to comply with GCP and the protocol were obtained.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that (i) affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or (ii) affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the generic identity of the biological product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a biological product containing a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug Designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a biological product containing the same active moiety for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same biological product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug Designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee.
Disclosure of clinical trial information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the clinical trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Pediatric information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which Orphan Drug Designation has been granted.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides sponsors of NDAs with an additional six-month period of market exclusivity for all unexpired patent or non-patent exclusivity on all forms of the drug containing the active moiety if the sponsor submits results of pediatric studies specifically requested by the FDA under BPCA within required timeframes. The BPCA provides sponsors of BLAs an additional six-month extension for all unexpired non-patent market exclusivity on all forms of the biological containing the active moiety pursuant to the BPCA if the conditions under the BPCA are met.
Additional controls for biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for 
distribution.  If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer.
In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Patent term restoration
After approval, owners of relevant drug or biologic patents may apply for up to a five year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between IND application and NDA or BLA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA or BLA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension.  An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times.  For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the USPTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely.  Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug or biologic for which an NDA or BLA has not been submitted.
Biosimilars
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical trials, animal trials, and a clinical trial or trials, unless the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services waives a required element. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. The first biosimilar was approved by the FDA in 2015, and the first interchangeable product was approved in 2021.
A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) 18 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) 18 months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
Post-approval requirements
Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.
 Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a submission to and approval by the FDA before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application and similar procedures and actions in reviewing BLA or supplements as in reviewing BLAs.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to 
cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs.  Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, biological product manufacturers in the U.S. must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate products.
FDA regulation of companion diagnostics
If use of an in vitro diagnostic is essential for safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product.  The review of an in vitro companion diagnostic in conjunction with the review of a biologic involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Pursuing FDA approval of an in vitro companion diagnostic would require us to obtain a premarket approval, or PMA. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $250,000 for most PMAs. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA application submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the U.S.
Other U.S. health care laws and compliance requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, anti-kickback statutes, false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable 
under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product.  Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any health care benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain health care fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and 
investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other health care entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state health care laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third- party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state health care programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.  In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on health care pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Health care reform
Healthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices. On September 9, 2021, the Biden administration published a wide-ranging list of policy proposals, most of which would need to be carried out by Congress, to reduce drug prices and drug payment. The HHS plan includes, among other reform measures, proposals to lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and disincentivizing price increases, and to support market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase price transparency. Many similar proposals, including the plans to give Medicare Part D authority to negotiate drug prices, require drug manufacturers to pay rebates on drugs whose prices increase greater than the rate of inflation, and cap out-of-pocket costs, have already been included in policy statements and legislation currently being considered by Congress. It is unclear to what extent these and other statutory, regulatory, and administrative initiatives will be enacted and implemented. In March 2010, President Obama enacted the ACA, which has begun to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and has also begun to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. The ACA will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional regulation
In addition to the foregoing, we are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Europe / rest of world government regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the United Kingdom (“UK”) and countries in the EU, for example, a Clinical Trial Authorisation, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU and UK regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU and the UK, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the EU and the UK, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Australia
Conducting clinical trials for therapeutic drug candidates in Australia is subject to regulation by Australian governmental entities. Approval for inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, or the ARTG, is required before a pharmaceutical drug product may be marketed in Australia.
Typically, the process of obtaining approval of a new therapeutic drug product for inclusion in the ARTG requires compilation of clinical trial data. Clinical trials conducted using “unapproved therapeutic goods” in Australia, being those which have not yet been evaluated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, or the TGA, for quality, safety and efficacy must occur pursuant to either the Clinical Trial Notification, or CTN, or Clinical Trial Exemption, or CTX, process.
The CTN process broadly involves:
•completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing;
•submission to a Human Research Ethics Committee, or the HREC, of all material relating to the proposed clinical trial, including the trial protocol.  The TGA does not review any data relating to the clinical trial;
•the institution or organization at which the clinical trial will be conducted, referred to as the “Approving Authority” gives the final approval for the conduct of the clinical trial at the site, having due regard to the advice from the HREC; and
•CTN clinical trials cannot commence until the clinical trial has been notified to the TGA.
Under the CTX process:
•a sponsor submits an application to conduct a clinical trial to the TGA for evaluation and comment; and
•a sponsor cannot commence a CTX clinical trial until written advice has been received from the TGA regarding the application and approval for the conduct of the clinical trial has been obtained from an ethics committee and the institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted.
In each case, it is required that:
•adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the therapeutic product;
•evidence is compiled which demonstrates that the manufacture of the therapeutic drug product complies with the principles of cGMP;
•manufacturing and clinical data is derived to submit to the Australian Committee on Prescription Medicines, which makes recommendations to the TGA as to whether or not to grant approval to include the therapeutic drug product in the ARTG; and
•an ultimate decision is made by the TGA whether to include the therapeutic drug product in the ARTG.
Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the therapeutic drug product as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the drug. The results of the pre-clinical studies form part of the materials submitted to the investigators HREC in the case of a CTN trial and part of the application to the TGA in the case of a CTX trial.
Clinical trials involve administering the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. The TGA has developed guidelines for a CTN. Under the CTN process, all material relating to the proposed clinical trial is submitted directly to the HREC of each institution at which the clinical trial is to be conducted. An HREC is an independent review committee set up under guidelines of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. The role of an HREC is to ensure the protection of rights, safety and wellbeing of human subjects involved in a clinical trial by, among other things, reviewing, approving and providing continuing review of trial protocols and amendments, and of the methods and material to be used in obtaining and documenting informed consent of the trial subjects. The TGA is formally notified by submission of a CTN application but does not review the safety of the drug or any aspect of the proposed trial. The approving authority of each institution gives the final approval for the conduct of the clinical trial, having due regard to advice from the HREC. Following approval, responsibility for all aspects of the trial conducted under a CTN application remains with the HREC of each investigator’s institution.
The standards for clinical research in Australia are set by the TGA and the National Health and Medical Research Council, and compliance with GCP is mandatory. Guidelines, such as those promulgated by the International Conference on 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, are required across all fields, including those related to pharmaceutical quality, nonclinical and clinical data requirements and study designs. The basic requirements for preclinical data to support a first-in- human study under ICH guidelines are applicable in Australia. Requirements related to adverse event reporting in Australia are similar to those required in other major jurisdictions.
