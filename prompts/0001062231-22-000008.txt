Industry Trends 
See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis - Industry Trends.”

Productive Materials
We believe that we have adequate sources of supply of productive materials and components for our manufacturing needs, including steel, aluminum and other metallic materials, and resources used for vehicle electrification and electronic integration. Most raw materials (such as steel) and semi-processed or finished items are available within the geographical regions of our operating facilities from qualified sources in quantities sufficient for our needs.  We currently have contracts with our steel suppliers that ensure continuity of supply to our principal operating facilities.  We also have validation and testing capabilities that enable us to strategically qualify steel sources on a global basis. As we continue to expand our global manufacturing footprint, we may need to rely on suppliers in local markets that have not yet proven their ability to meet our requirements. 
During 2021, the automotive industry experienced, and continues to experience, significant disruptions in the supply chain, including a shortage of semiconductor chips used by our customers and increased metal and commodity costs. We continue to work with customers and suppliers in our effort to protect continuity of supply as we expect these challenges to continue into 2022. 
Patents and Trademarks
We maintain and have pending various United States (U.S.) and foreign patents, trademarks and other rights to intellectual property relating to our business, which we believe are appropriate to protect our interest in existing products, new inventions, manufacturing processes and product developments. We do not believe that any single patent or trademark is material to our business, nor would expiration or invalidity of any patent or trademark have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to compete.
Cyclicality and Seasonality
Our operations are cyclical because they are directly related to worldwide automotive production, which is itself cyclical and dependent on general economic conditions and other factors. Typically, our business is moderately seasonal as our major OEM customers historically have an extended shutdown of operations (typically 1-2 weeks) in conjunction with their model year changeover and an approximate one-week shutdown in December. Our major OEM customers also occasionally have longer shutdowns of operations (up to 6 weeks) for program changeovers. Accordingly, our quarterly results may reflect these trends.
Litigation and Environmental Matters
We are involved in, or potentially subject to, various legal proceedings or claims incidental to our business. These include, but are not limited to, matters arising out of product warranties, contractual matters, and environmental obligations. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, at this time we do not believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
We file U.S. federal, state and local income tax returns, as well as foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions throughout the world. We are also subject to examinations of these tax returns by the relevant tax authorities. Negative or unexpected outcomes of these examinations and audits, and any related litigation, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws, regulations and ordinances, including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. We will continue to closely monitor our environmental conditions to ensure that we are in compliance with all laws, regulations and ordinances. We have made, and anticipate continuing to make, capital and other expenditures (including recurring administrative costs) to comply with environmental requirements at our current and former facilities. Such expenditures were not significant in 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Human Capital Management
Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to attract, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse workforce. We employ approximately 18,000 associates on a global basis (including our joint venture affiliates) of which 6,000 are employed in the U.S. and 12,000 are employed at our non-U.S. locations. Approximately 4,500 are salaried associates and approximately 13,500 are hourly associates. Of the 13,500 hourly associates, approximately 71% are covered under collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.
Creating a Diverse, Equitable and Inclusive Culture 
At AAM, we believe diversity drives creativity. We believe an equitable and inclusive culture encourages, supports and celebrates the unique voices of our global workforce. AAM is committed to listening, learning and taking action that will move our company and our communities forward, together. Embracing diversity promotes innovation and helps AAM to attract and retain the best talent everywhere we do business.
AAM is committed to initiatives that will foster a culture of inclusion and develop a more diverse workforce. In 2021, AAM demonstrated this commitment by joining other companies in signing the CEO Action Pledge on Diversity and Inclusion. This pledge is a commitment to drive measurable action and meaningful change in advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace.
To drive progress in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and cultivate a more inclusive culture, AAM's senior leadership, with active oversight from our Board of Directors and input from our DEI Steering Committee, selected five key areas of focus: enhancing DEI skills, maintaining a safe and inclusive environment, providing equitable talent management and inclusive benefits and policies, supporting stakeholder engagement and reinforcing leadership ownership and accountability.
In 2021, the highlights of our DEI actions included:
•Establishing AAM's DEI Mutual Respect Statement;
•Conducting DEI in the Workplace training for all U.S. associates, including unconscious bias training;
•Establishing Associate Resource Group guidelines, and the formation of a Veteran’s resource group;
•Implementing a professional development program focused on early career and mid-level women leaders; and
•Organizing events and activities to recognize National Diversity Week and Hispanic Heritage Month.
Attracting and Retaining Associates
Our AAM360 program serves as the foundation for our recruitment and retention strategy. Its four components are designed to enhance our associates’ experience at AAM and includes associate health and safety, professional development, competitive compensation and benefits and the global community. These programs offer resources, tools and events that are designed to empower associates in their work and personal lives. Empowerment of our associates is essential to continuously improving our quality performance, technology leadership and operational excellence and enabling our associates to grow professionally into the leaders that will guide AAM into the future.
Our AAM360 program assists management in developing and implementing standards for recruitment and selection of a knowledgeable and diverse workforce, promoting learning and growth and driving effective performance while fostering an environment of open communication with AAM leadership in a variety of formats, including townhall-style meetings. AAM associates can also raise issues and concerns to the attention of management through the use of associate surveys and our 24/7 ethics hotline. Through our AAM360 program, AAM management monitors workforce demographics and attrition, associate performance data, succession and development plans and feedback from associates to ensure that our associates’ experience is meeting these objectives.
During 2021, the automotive industry experienced, and continues to experience, significant disruptions in the supply chain, including labor shortages in a variety of positions and experience levels, primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are taking measures to address these labor issues across our global operations to mitigate the impact to AAM, including actively managing production schedules and reviewing our compensation and benefit programs to ensure that they are competitive with the market, including working with the union organizations that represent certain associates.
Developing Associates
We have established sustainable and adaptable talent management programs focused on the training and development of our associates. These programs are designed to help associates realize their full potential by understanding the expectations of their current role and setting goals for future growth and learning, which contributes to the overall success of AAM. 
Health and Wellness Programs 
At AAM, the health of our associates is very important to us. We maintain a comprehensive, interactive and personalized wellness program to make it easy for our associates and their families to live a healthier lifestyle and help achieve personal wellness goals.
S4 (S-to-the-Fourth) Safety System
At AAM, our first responsibility every day, in every facility, is the safety of our approximately 18,000 global associates. AAM’s S4 safety system is focused on developing, engaging, monitoring, and continuously educating our associates on standardized procedures that are the basis of our safety culture and safety policy.
The primary goal of S4 is to achieve compliance with all internal and external requirements and regulations while driving behavioral changes to maintain a safe and environmentally friendly workplace. At AAM, we believe safety performance is a journey where each facility strives to achieve S4 by moving from a reactive safety environment to an interdependent safety environment.
We are focused on continuous improvement of the S4 system and in our total recordable incident rate (TRIR) in every facility. AAM’s leaders continuously monitor our facilities progress in the S4 Safety System. In 2021, our TRIR was 0.9 – a reduction of approximately 57% in recordable injuries since the S4 program began in 2015. 
Partnering with our Global Communities
AAM believes that we have a responsibility to give back to the communities in which we live and work. AAM has long-standing relationships with charitable organizations to support local families, youth outreach, education, wellness, and social equality. We support global organizations with both donations and volunteer hours, and AAM associates across the globe regularly participate in charitable and community events that allow our team to contribute to causes important to them.
