Item 1. Description of Business
General
 
Gala Pharmaceutical Inc. (the “Company”)(“GPI”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 10, 2010. The Company was originally formed to provide garment tailoring and alteration services.
 
The Company then expanded into the Hemp and Cannabidiol (“CBD”) industry. The expansion focused on the development, research, and commercialization of products derived from the Hemp and Cannabis Plant. At the time GPI was also seeking acquisition candidates in this area of interest in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries.
 
Gala Pharmaceutical Inc. then hired industry-leading experts in the field of Genomics to utilize their expertise to improve crop yields by utilizing advanced breeding and molecular technologies. The company intended to use proprietary equipment and techniques to ensure the genetic fingerprint of each plant is identical and is cultivated in a controlled environment significantly reducing the variability of each plants yield. It is anticipated that Gala Pharmaceuticals Inc., may at some point provide oversight for the development of fully cGMP production of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) for use in forecasted clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of the various plant extracts.
 
The Company currently has been approved by the City of Long Beach to build a testing Cannabis Lab and the Lab build-out is scheduled to be completed on May 19, 2019. The company intends to provide Testing or Analytical Chemistry tools for chemical, plant, soil, and liquid.
 
The Company also will provide genetic “fingerprinting” and “sequencing” of various crop species. This Fingerprinting allows for storing genetic fingerprint information into a proprietary database. Customers can access genetic fingerprint data which can be used for predictive breeding applications and for protecting intellectual property (IP).
