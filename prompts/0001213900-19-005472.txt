ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
 
Our business plan as an oil and gas company is to focus primarily on properties in the Gulf Coast Region. We plan to obtain and manage working and non-working interests in oil and gas properties.
 
We are in the business of exploring for, drilling and producing oil and gas. Our business is subject to multiple factors effecting the production of oil and gas, including, but not limited to: market prices; national and international economic conditions; import and export quotas; availability of drilling rigs, casing, pipe, and other equipment and supplies; availability of and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities; the supply and price of competitive fuels; and the regulation of prices, production, transportation, and marketing by domestic and foreign governmental authorities. Additionally, we may not have control over whether the owner or operator of the lease will elect to explore for oil and gas on such properties, or to develop the properties following discoveries that may occur. Each of these factors may affect the rate at which oil and gas are produced, if ever, on properties in which we may have an interest.


In March 2014, we entered into a farm out letter agreement with GulfSlope Energy, Inc. (“GulfSlope”) relating to certain prospects GulfSlope bid on at the Central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 231, located within 2.2 million acres of 3-D seismic licensed and interpreted by GulfSlope. Under the terms of the farm-out letter agreement, as amended, we acquired contractual rights to a 20% working interest in 12 blocks covered in 9 prospects for approximately $10,720,000 paid to GulfSlope through September 30, 2018. We have agreed to pay our proportionate share of the net rental costs related to the prospects. GulfSlope has conducted extensive seismic work on all of the prospects focusing on the high potential subsalt play at depths of 15,000’ to 25,000’ and will be the operator of record for the initial well on each of the prospects. In August 2017, the Company acquired a 20% working interest from GulfSlope in Ship Shoal Block 351 and in Ship Shoal Block 336, which are collectively referred to as the Tau Prospect. In October 2017, the Company acquired a 20% working interest from GulfSlope in Eugene Island Block 397 and Green Canyon Block 4, which are collectively referred to as the Quark Prospect. In January 2018, the Company acquired a 20% working interest in the Vermilion South Addition Block 378 (“Canoe Prospect”) and in the Vermilion South Addition Block 375 (“Corvette Prospect”) from GulfSlope.

On January 8, 2018, the Company entered into a participation agreement dated effective January 1, 2018 (the “Agreement”) with Delek GOM Investments, LLC, a subsidiary of Delek Group Ltd. (“Delek”), and GulfSlope (collectively, the “Parties”) for the partial farm-out of the Company’s interests in its Gulf of Mexico oil and gas leases (the “Farm-out”). The Agreement sets out the terms and conditions of the Parties participation in the drilling of up to a nine well multi-phase exploration program targeting the Company’s prospects (the “Prospects”) located on the Company’s existing leases (the “Leases”).
 
Under the terms of the Agreement, the Parties have committed to initially drill two of the Company’s prospects in Phase I (the “Initial Phase”) with Delek having the option to participate in two additional two-well drilling phases and a final, three-well drilling phase (collectively, the “Phases”). In each Phase, Delek will earn a 75% working interest upon paying 90% of the exploratory costs associated with drilling each exploratory well. The Company will thus retain a 5% working interest while paying 2% of the exploratory costs associated with drilling each well. In addition, Delek will pay the Company $405,000 upon the filing of each exploration plan with BOEM and/or BSEE on a Prospect in each Phase. During March 2018 Delek made its first payment of $405,000 to the Company as the initial plan was filed. Delek made a second payment of $405,000 to the Company during May 2018. Also, each Party will be responsible for its pro rata share (based on working interest) of delay rentals associated with the Prospects. GulfSlope will be the Operator during exploratory drilling of a Prospect, however, subsequent to a commercial discovery, Delek will have the right to become the Operator. Delek will have the right to terminate this Agreement at the conclusion of any drilling Phase. Delek will also have the option to purchase up to 5% of the Company’s common stock upon fulfilling its obligation for each Phase (maximum of 20% in the aggregate) at a price per share equal to a 10% discount to the 30-day weighted average closing price for the Company’s common stock preceding the acquisition. This option will expire on January 8, 2020. The Company has not recorded any cost associated with the option due to the future performance obligation of Delek. If Delek meets the obligation and exercises its option the Company will record the option value at that time as an increase to Oil and Gas Properties. The likelihood of Delek exercising its options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock will be dependent on the drilling results from Phase 1 and the Company’s operating results which will affect the price of the Company’s common stock. We currently do not anticipate Delek fully exercising this option before the expiration date. At December 31, 2018, the potential value of issuing 20% of our outstanding stock is approximately $5,800,000. The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be a complete description of the terms, provisions and conditions of such document, and represents only a summary of certain of the principal terms, provisions and conditions thereof.
 
The Company will assign a two-tenths of one percent of 8/8ths net profits interest in certain of the Company’s oil and gas leases in the two Phase I prospects to Hi-View Investment Partners, LLC (“Hi-View”) in consideration for consulting services provided pursuant to a non-exclusive consulting engagement dated October 25, 2017, by and between Hi-View, the Company, and GulfSlope (the “Advisory Agreement”). Hi-View will be entitled to additional assignments on the same terms and conditions as described above related to any of Leases in which Delek elects to participate in the drilling of an exploratory well. In addition, the Company issued an aggregate of twenty million shares of its common stock to Hi-View in consideration for those consulting services provided pursuant to the Advisory Agreement.
 
In accordance with the Delek Agreement and on behalf of the Company and the other working interest owners, GulfSlope as operator, spudded the OCS-G-35589 # 1 well on the Canoe Prospect on Vermilion Block 378 where the Company holds a 5% working interest in July 2018. The well was drilled and evaluated to a total depth of 5,765’ MD (5,700’ TVD). Based on logging-while-drilling (LWD) and other test results, thin oil bearing sands were encountered which require further study. As a result, open-hole plugs were set across several intervals in accordance with governmental regulations and the well is now plugged and abandoned at this time. Since the well is equipped with a mud-line suspension system, it is available for future re-entry as warranted.
 
At the beginning of September 2018, the Company and the other working interest owners began drilling operations at the Tau Prospect on Ship Shoal Blocks 336 and 351 offshore Louisiana. The well, OCS-G 36121 #1, is planned to test Miocene reservoirs beneath thick salt sheets in approximately 300’ of water depth. Operated by GulfSlope, the well is currently drilling below 14,500’ to an expected total depth below 16,500’ TVD. As a result of drilling difficulties on the well there have been substantial cost over-runs to date which the Company has not yet fully funded. As of March 15, 2019, the Company has been declared to be in default under the terms of its joint operating agreement by the operator regarding the payment of $1,299,229 due as of February 12, 2019 with respect to drilling the Tau Prospect. The operator of the Tau Prospect asserts that additional joint interest billings to the Company during the past 30 days have increased the total amount due to $1,915,304 as of March 15, 2019. The Company’s share of the original AFE to drill to 29,800’ Measured Depth (MD) was approximately $800,000. Drilling of the Tau Prospect continues which will result in further amounts owed by the Company to GulfSlope. The operating agreement grants a lien and security interest on the Company’s interest in the leases comprising the Tau Prospect, and grants to the operator the right to pursue foreclosure of the lien and security interest. The Company is using its best efforts to raise capital to fund its obligations under the operating agreement with GulfSlope regarding the drilling of the Tau Prospect. If the Company fails to raise needed capital and foreclosure is pursued and is successful, this could result in a loss of all of the Company’s rights in the Tau Prospect.

In January 2017, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Sydson Energy, Inc. (“Sydson Energy”) and Sydson Resources, L.P. (“Sydson Resources” and collectively with Sydson Energy, “Sydson”), where Sydson assigned to us certain onshore oil and gas assets and interests and certain tangible assets and additionally, certain employees and a consultant of Sydson have agreed to become employees and a consultant of the Company. Sydson is a private oil and gas company with land operations in Texas and Louisiana that has been in business since 1982. The oil and gas assets include the following:
 

● | In Texas, we acquired a 50% working interest in the undrilled acreage above 4,500’ in the West Tuleta Field, Bee County, Texas comprised of approximately 1,800 gross acres and 900 net acres with a net revenue interest of approximately 75%. The primary drilling objectives are the Vicksburg and Hockley sands which are structurally high on this acreage compared to the prior downdip production.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the adjacent Ray Field, also in Bee County, Texas, we acquired a 50% working interest in the undrilled, acreage on the Walton, Campbell, and Ray leases comprising approximately 75 gross acres with a net revenue interest of approximately 75%. The primary drilling objectives on this acreage are also the Vicksburg and Hockley sands updip to prior production above 3,700’.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Southeast of San Antonio at the Wilinda Project we are acquiring leases with working interest partners covering more than 4,400 acres for horizontal projects above 6,000’ in the Austin Chalk, Eagle Ford, and Buda Lime formation. These projects are adjacent to substantial prior production and contain both conventional and unconventional oil targets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In September of 2018, we commenced drilling on the TXSO Richter Unit #1H well. The well was drilled, cased and cemented to a depth of 9,442’ with a horizontal lateral exceeding 4,000’. The well was frac’d and is now being evaluated with flowback testing. During the flowback period, the well initially produced at rates exceeding 1,000 barrels of frac load water per day with minor amounts of oil and gas. Subsequently, the oil and gas rates did not improve and the Company now believes that the water production is from a deeper zone which is obstructing the oil and gas flow from the Austin Chalk completion zone. The Company plans to isolate the section of the lateral that appears to be the source of the extraneous water and produce the remaining part of the lateral, using a comparable procedure to that used on a nearby well that encountered a similar problem.

 
In connection with the asset acquisition, certain officers and employees of Sydson have become officers, a consultant and employees of the Company, including Michael J. Mayell as chief executive officer, James L. Gunderson as manager of land, Robert F. Goldstein as a geological consultant, and Lecia Alexander as controller. Certain other non-executive employees and consultants of Sydson became at-will employees of the Company. Also at that time, John B. Connally III joined our Company board as chairman.

Oil and Gas Industry
 
The oil and gas industry is a complex, multi-disciplinary sector that varies greatly across geographies. As a heavily regulated industry, operating conditions are subject to political regimes and changing legislation. Governments can either induce or deter investment in exploration and production, depending on legal requirements, fiscal and royalty structures and regulation. Beyond political considerations, exploration and production for hydrocarbons is an extremely risky business with multiple failure modes. Exploration and production wells require substantial capital investment and are long-term projects, sometimes exceeding twenty to thirty years. Regardless of the effort spent on an exploration or production prospect, success is difficult to attain. Even though modern equipment, including seismic equipment and advanced processing and evaluation software, has helped geologists find producing structures and map reservoirs, they do not guarantee any outcome. Drilling is the only method able to ultimately determine whether a prospect will be productive, and even then, many complications can arise during drilling (e.g., those relating to drilling depths, pressure, porosity, weather conditions, and the porosity and permeability of the formation and rock hardness).
 
Typically, there is a significant chance that exploratory wells will result in non-producing holes, leaving investors with the cost of leases, overhead, seismic data and a dry well which can total millions of dollars. Even if oil or gas is produced from a particular well, there is always the possibility that unforeseen treatment, at additional cost, may be required to make production commercially viable. Further, production profiles decline over time. In summary, oil and gas exploration and production is an industry with high risks and high entry barriers, but it is also potentially lucrative.
 
For any given rate of production and volume of hydrocarbons recovered, oil and gas prices determine the commercial feasibility of a project. Certain projects may become feasible with higher prices or, conversely, may falter with lower prices. Volatility in the price of oil, gas and other commodities has increased during the last few years, complicating the assessment of revenue projections. Most governments have enforced strict regulations to uphold high standards of environmental awareness; thus, holding companies to a high degree of responsibility vis-а-vis protecting the environment. Aside from such environmental factors, oil and gas drilling is often conducted near populated areas. For a company to be successful in its drilling endeavors, working relationships with local communities are often crucial to promote business strategies and avoid the repercussions of disputes that might arise over local business operations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company does not have any production or proved oil or gas reserves.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
The operator of any oil and gas operations will be subject to various federal, state, and local governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for materials used in drilling operations, drilling and abandonment bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, pooling of properties, and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas. The production, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of oil and gas, by-products thereof, and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations are also subject to regulation under federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating primarily to the protection of safety, human health and the environment. State and local laws and regulations may affect the prices at which owners are paid for their leases by requiring more stringent disclosure and certification requirements, adjusting interest rates for late payments, raising legal and administrative costs and imposing more costly default contractual terms. The requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their ultimate effect, if any, on the lessee to pay royalties.
 
Environmental laws provide for, among other things, restrictions and prohibitions on spills, releases, or emissions of various substances produced in association with oil and gas operations. The laws also require that wells and facility sites be operated, maintained, abandoned, and reclaimed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authorities. Compliance with such laws can require significant expenditures and a breach may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, some of which may be material. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability, and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs. The discharge of oil or gas or other pollutants into the air, soil, or water may give rise to liabilities to governments and third parties and may require the operator to incur costs to remedy such discharge. In addition, the operator and other working interest owners could incur fines, penalties or significant liability for damages, clean-up costs, and penalties in the event of discharges into the environment, environmental damage caused by the operator or previous owners of the property, or non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations. In addition to actions brought by governmental agencies, the operator and owners could face actions brought by private parties or citizens groups. There can be no assurance that the forgoing will not increase the cost of production, development, or exploration activities for the operator or otherwise adversely affect the payment of royalties on the property.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
The operator of our oil and gas interests (we intend to operate many of our onshore prospects) will be subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Applicable U.S. federal environmental laws include, but are not limited to, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). These laws and regulations govern environmental cleanup standards, require permits for air, water, underground injection, solid and hazardous waste disposal and set environmental compliance criteria. In addition, state and local laws and regulations set forth specific standards for drilling wells, the maintenance of bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, the spacing and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells, and the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters. Typically, operators and owners maintain insurance against costs of clean-up operations, but may not be fully insured against all such risks. Additionally, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise the environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in delay or more stringent and costly permitting, waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements for the oil and gas industry could have a significant impact on the operator’s costs.

The environmental laws and regulations that could have a material impact on the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, including on the operators of our future oil and gas interests, thereby indirectly impacting our business, including the following:
 
Hazardous Substances and Wastes. CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund law,” imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liabilities for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file corresponding common law claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
Waste Discharge. The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or an analogous state agency. The CWA and regulations implemented there under also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment beams and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for noncompliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
Air Emissions. The CAA and associated state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and gas operations. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before construction can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. More stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) have been developed by the EPA and may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities.
Oil Pollution Act. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”) and regulations there under impose a variety of requirements on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in United States waters. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulations. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA. OPA imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill.
National Environmental Policy Act. Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. The process involves the preparation of either an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement depending on whether the specific circumstances surrounding the proposed federal action will have a significant impact on the human environment. The NEPA process involves public input through comments which can alter the nature of a proposed project either by limiting the scope of the project or requiring resource-specific mitigation. NEPA decisions can be appealed through the court system by process participants. This process may result in delaying the permitting and development of projects, increase the costs of permitting and developing some facilities and could result in certain instances in the cancellation of existing leases.
Worker Safety. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety aspects. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties.
Safe Drinking Water Act. The Safe Drinking Water Act and comparable state statutes restrict the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development. Subsurface emplacement of fluids (including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery) is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in some cases, includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities.

Offshore Drilling. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Interior issued new rules designed to improve drilling and workplace safety in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and various congressional committees began pursuing legislation to regulate drilling activities and increase liability. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”), the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) and the Office of National Resources Revenue are expected to continue to issue new safety and environmental guidelines or regulations for drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and other regulatory agencies could potentially issue new safety and environmental guidelines or regulations in other geographic regions, and may take other steps that could increase the costs of exploration and production, reduce the area of operations and result in permitting delays. We are monitoring legislation and regulatory developments; however, it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of any new guidelines, regulations or legislation. A prolonged suspension of drilling activity or permitting delays in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and new regulations and increased liability for companies operating in this sector, whether or not caused by a new incident in the region, could adversely affect the business and planned operations of oil and gas companies.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on our Business
 
We are subject to the following regulations of the SEC and applicable securities laws, rules and regulations:
 
Smaller Reporting Company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company.” That designation relieves us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation S-K applicable to larger companies.
 
Sarbanes/Oxley Act. Except Section 302 and 404, we are also subject to the Sarbanes/Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes/Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthen auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management’s assessment of our internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes/Oxley Act has and will continue to substantially impact our legal and accounting costs.
 
Exchange Act Reporting Requirements. We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 14 and 16 of the Exchange Act, are required to file annual reports on SEC Form 10-K and quarterly reports on SEC Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and will be required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control and acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business) in a current report on SEC Form 8-K.
Competition
 
The Company is competing with other oil companies for oil and gas leases and concessions. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive in all of its phases, with competition for favorable producing royalties, overriding royalties, and good oil and gas leases being particularly intense. The Company believes that the exploration program, promised expenditures, geological and geophysical skill, and familiarity with an area of operations are primary competitive factors in the identification, selection, and acquisition of desirable leases. When attempting to purchase interests in such properties, the Company competes with independent operators and major oil companies, many of which possess and employ superior financial resources that allow them to obtain substantially greater technical and personnel resources than ours. Competitors may be able to evaluate and purchase a greater number of mineral rights or royalty interests than our financial or personnel resources permit. Competitors may also be able to pay more for prospects than we are able or willing to pay. If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future, our future growth may be diminished or restricted.
Employees
 
As of April 1, 2019, the Company has six employees and one consultant.
 
Historical Background
 
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 15, 2010, as “INKA Productions Corp.” In September 2013, we changed our business to an oil and gas company focused primarily on properties in the Gulf Coast Region and changed the name of the Company from “INKA Productions, Corp.” to “Texas South Energy, Inc.”
 
In January 2017, we issued Mr. Mayell 100,000,000 shares of common stock in connection with the Sydson transaction, and Mr. Mayell was appointed president, chief executive officer and a director. Mr. Connally was appointed as chairman of the board and entered into an employment agreement whereby we issued him 65,100,000 shares of common stock. Mr. Askew resigned as an executive officer and as a director and entered into a consulting agreement pursuant to which he was issued 27,000,000 shares of common stock.
 
In January 2017, pursuant to the laws of the State of Texas, the Company formed Texas South Operating Company, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Texas South Energy, Inc. and Texas South Operating Company, Inc. (collectively, the “Company”) began filing consolidated financial statements effective with the March 31, 2017 filing.
