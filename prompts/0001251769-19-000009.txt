ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 We are a medical technology company primarily focused on the design, development and commercialization of innovative medical devices to advance gastrointestinal therapeutic endoscopy. 
 Our strategic focus and our future revenue growth is expected to come from our Endo-bariatric product portfolio, which consists of the OverStitchTM Endoscopic Suturing System and Orbera® managed weight loss system. In the past, a portion of our product revenues has come from the Surgical product line, which consisted of the Lap-Band® System and related laparoscopic accessories but this line was divested in December 2018. 
 We are one of the market share leaders in less invasive devices that treat various gastrointestinal ("GI") conditions, ranging from gastrointestinal defect repairs to the interventional treatment of obesity. Our products are used by gastroenterologists and bariatric surgeons in a variety of settings to provide interventional therapy to patients who suffer from obesity and the many co-morbidities associated with obesity, other GI conditions including closure of acute perforations and chronic fistulas; inadvertent perforation of the GI tract; tissue closure after the removal of abnormal lesions in the esophagus, stomach or colon (also known as endoscopic submucosal dissections and endoscopic mucosal resections) and in the treatment of swallowing disorders (peroral endoscopic myotomy, or "POEM") as well as to suture in place esophageal stents in order to prevent their migration. 
 We believe that obesity is a chronic disease that places a tremendous burden on healthcare systems and their costs worldwide. The optimal clinical outcome for a substantial portion of patients suffering from obesity will require interventional treatments. As a result, our product portfolio consists of interventional devices that fill the gap between low efficacy drug treatments for obesity and highly-invasive, anatomy-altering bariatric stapling procedures. 
Corporate Background
 Apollo was founded in 2005 and is currently incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in Austin, Texas. The Company was founded to develop and commercialize innovations originating from a collaboration of physicians from the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins University, Medical University of South Carolina, the University of Texas Medical Branch and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who called themselves the Apollo Group. The work of the Apollo Group resulted in a significant portfolio of patents in the field of flexible endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery aimed at minimizing the trauma of surgical access by taking advantage of natural orifices to deliver surgical tools to targeted areas.
 In December 2013, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the obesity intervention division of Allergan, Inc. In conjunction with this purchase agreement, we entered into several agreements whereby Allergan agreed to provide manufacturing and distribution support over a two-year period as we established our own manufacturing and worldwide distribution capabilities. 
 Following this acquisition, we established offices in England, Australia, Italy and Brazil that oversee regional sales and distribution activities outside the U.S.; a manufacturing facility in Costa Rica; and a device analysis lab in California. All other activities are managed and operated from our facilities in Austin, Texas.
 In December 2016, we completed a business combination (the "Merger") with Lpath, Inc. ("Lpath"), a publicly traded company. Following the Merger, Lpath was renamed "Apollo Endosurgery, Inc." and our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "APEN." 
 In December 2018, Apollo entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement ("Purchase Agreement") with ReShape Lifesciences, Inc. ("ReShape") pursuant to which, among other things, ReShape acquired from Apollo substantially all of our assets exclusively related to the Surgical product line for $10.0 million in cash and future cash consideration. As additional consideration, we also received from ReShape substantially all of their assets exclusively related to their intragastric balloon product line. On December 31, 2018, the Company ceased sales of ReShape's intragastric balloon product.

Overview of the Market
 The majority of procedures performed using our Endo-bariatric products are either related to gastrointestinal defect and complication management or bariatric (weight loss) interventional treatment. 
 Interventional and therapeutic gastroenterology is a high growth area within medicine and our suturing product is used for patient treatment needs in both the upper and lower GI tract. Examples of upper GI applications include fistula closure, esophageal stent fixation, and closure for POEM. Fistulas are chronic or acute defects that can form between two cavities in the GI tract, often occurring as a result of abdominal surgery. Esophageal stents are often used as part of the treatment of esophageal cancers and premature migration of the stent is common. Clinical evidence shows that esophageal stents that are not fixed in place will have as high as a 60% migration rate. Suturing stents in place helps reduce stent migration, preventing further procedures and complications for the patient. Achalasia is a condition where a patient has difficulty swallowing. As the incidence of achalasia increases, there is growing interest in endoscopic treatment options that can be offered, such as POEM. Suturing following the esophageal muscle dissection and release during a POEM presents a quick and low profile solution for the patient. 
 In the lower GI tract, there are over 20 million colonoscopies performed annually. Cancer screening followed by the endoscopic resection of flat gastrointestinal tumors or polyps can provide patients with a viable option to colorectal surgery. Suturing the resection site aids in healing and helps prevent delayed bleeding following the procedure.
 Obesity as a disease is increasing worldwide. In the U.S., it is estimated that 78 million adults are obese or clinically obese with a body mass index ("BMI") of 30 or more. It is further estimated that 24 million adults are severely or morbidly obese in the U.S., with a BMI greater than 40. Over 650 million people around the world are considered obese.
 Traditional obesity intervention has been bariatric surgery (gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding), which is mostly performed laparoscopically. Today, based on U.S. population demographics and physician society reported bariatric procedure volumes, less than 2% of the population eligible for bariatric surgery have a procedure. We believe that the primary detractor from bariatric surgery is patient fear; fear of surgery in general, but more specifically fear associated with the highly-invasive nature of bariatric surgery, permanent anatomical alteration, potential for non-permanent results and the post-operative severe complications that can be associated with bariatric surgery.  
Apollo's Strategy
 Our objective is to provide products that advance gastrointestinal therapeutic endoscopic solutions for a wide range of interventional patient needs ranging from gastrointestinal defect repairs to the interventional treatment of obesity. Our "Endo-bariatric" products allow these treatments to be delivered by an endoscopist endolumenally with a flexible endoscope and thus provide patients with therapy options other than or prior to traditional surgery. 
 The key elements of our strategy include:
•Support the adoption of our Endo-bariatric products - We accomplish this today through our medical education activities, field sales support, and clinical investments that support product adoption and use. In addition, when appropriate, we support adoption through patient education and outreach initiatives. 
•Continue to deliver innovative products and broaden the product portfolio -We intend to broaden our portfolio of products through internal product development efforts and will consider acquisitions that complement our current business. 
•Expand into new markets -We intend to continue to pursue regulatory clearance for our products and improved distribution in key international markets where we believe there is or will be strong market demand for our products. 
Apollo Products
Endo-bariatrics
 The Apollo Endo-bariatric products consist primarily of the OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System and the Intragastric Balloon System (most often branded as Orbera). For the year ended December 31, 2018, 68% of total revenues were from sales of the Endo-bariatric products. Of our total Endo-bariatric sales, 57% related to the OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System and 43% related to the Orbera Intragastric Balloon System products.
OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System
 The OverStitch and OverStitch Sx Endoscopic Suturing System ("ESS", "OverStitch", or "Sx") enables advanced endoscopic procedures by allowing physicians to place full-thickness sutures and secure the approximation of tissue through a flexible endoscope. OverStitch and OverStitch Sx are currently the only U.S. cleared flexible endoscopic suturing device capable of full-thickness suturing of tissue. OverStitch is a single-use suturing device that is attached to a flexible endoscope and allows a physician to access portions of a patient's GI tract and place full thickness sutures to approximate the tissue of the GI tract. The OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") 510(k) clearance in August 2008 and CE Mark in November 2012. The OverStitch Sx Endoscopic Suturing System received FDA 510(k) clearance in June 2018 and CE Mark in November 2018.
  The OverStitch device that was 510(k) cleared in August of 2008 is compatible with a specific dual channel flexible endoscope that has limited market presence, representing less than five percent of the flexible endoscopes in hospitals and clinics around the world. Beginning in November 2018, we began the first commercial shipments of the OverStitch Sx that is compatible with four major scope manufacturers and over 20 single-channel flexible endoscopes with diameters ranging from 8.8 mm to 9.8 mm. These Sx compatible single-channel endoscopes represents the majority of flexible endoscopes in hospitals and clinics around the world today. 
 We believe that the functionality of the OverStitch devices allows them to be used for a broad number of gastrointestinal as well as bariatric applications. Since its market introduction in 2008, over 35,000 OverStitch units have been sold for procedures worldwide.
 We estimate that approximately 40% of procedures performed with OverStitch were in connection with the treatment of GI defects and the remaining use was for the interventional treatment of obesity.
 One of the most promising newly developed weight-loss procedures is commonly referred to as endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty ("ESG"), which transorally uses endoscopic suturing with OverStitch to reduce the volume of the stomach and form a small diameter sleeve, similar to the goal of a surgical sleeve gastrectomy procedure but without the invasiveness and need for amputation of the gastric remnant. The advantages of the ESG as compared to a surgical sleeve include maintenance of the structural integrity of the gastric wall, reversibility, relative ease of revision or maintenance, lower procedure adverse events, and reduced costs.
 ESG is based on the placement of full-thickness sutures to secure the approximation of tissue which is the labeled indication of OverStitch. However, the labeled indication of the OverStitch device currently does not specifically identify the ESG procedure. The first multi-center study was presented in May 2016 at Digestive Disease Week which was updated to a 24-month follow-up study and was published in April 2017 in Obesity Surgery, the Journal of Metabolic Surgery and Allied Care. This was a three center (two in the U.S. and one in Spain) study of medical records of patients who underwent ESG from January 2013 to November 2015. All procedures were performed in a similar fashion using the OverStitch device to endolumenally place full-thickness sutures to fold in the greater curvature of the stomach, and reduce the volumetric capacity of the stomach in order to lower a patient's caloric intake and induce weight loss.
 A total of 248 patients were included in the study. Patient BMI at the start of the study was 37.8, plus or minus 5.6.
•215 patients reached 6-months follow-up and the study reported an average percentage total body weight loss ("TBWL") of 15.2%.
•57 patients reached 24-months follow-up and the study reported an average TBWL of 18.6%.
•There was no significant difference in weight loss between the three centers.
 Five serious adverse events occurred: two perigastric inflammatory fluid collections that resolved with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics, one self-limited hemorrhage from splenic laceration, one pulmonary embolism 72 hours after the procedure, and one pneumoperitoneum and pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. All five patients recovered fully. The 
 suturing-related serious adverse events were associated by the study's authors with suturing to reduce the fundus part of the stomach and as a result, reducing the fundus is no longer part of the standard ESG technique.
 In 2017, we entered into a clinical trial agreement with The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota to undertake the Multi-center ESG Randomized Interventional Trial ("MERIT-Trial") to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of ESG compared to efficacy endpoints set forth in a consensus statement of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ("ASGE") and the American Society of Metabolic Bariatric Surgery ("ASMBS") and its impact on obesity related comorbidities in patients with obesity and BMI between 30-45.
 The MERIT-Trial is expected to enroll two hundred patients, stratified into three groups (Obesity, Obesity with hypertension, Obesity with diabetes). The trial will have two levels: (1) the randomized study phase with primary outcomes for both treatment and control participants evaluated at twelve months, and (2) the crossover, non-randomized study phase with outcomes for (a) the initial treatment participants at 24 months after their ESG, and (b) the control cross-over participants evaluated at twelve months after their ESG.
 During 2017, we entered into a Registry Funding Agreement with the American Gastroenterological Association ("AGA") Center for GI Innovation and Technology to develop and administer a registry (the “AGA Registry”) to evaluate flexible endoscopic procedures enabled by the OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System.  The AGA Registry collects real-world evidence related to the safety and efficacy of a number of flexible endoscopic suturing-enabled procedures, including the revisions of patients after weight regain subsequent to an initial bariatric surgery; the fixation of esophageal stents to prevent migration; and data on other suturing procedures currently in practice. The resulting data will be used to present the benefits of endoscopic suturing procedures relative to traditional therapies. We expect the AGA to collect data for four years with interim reporting expected. 
 During 2018, in Europe we established a multi-center, longitudinal data repository for ESG and Gastrojejunal Anastomotic outlet revision procedures that will extend up to two years. This registry will collect both country specific and pan-European outcomes related to safety and effectiveness of procedures performed and will support informed decision-making throughout Europe. In addition, a second, multi-center, retrospective data repository for gastrointestinal applications performed using the OverStitch System was also created. The objective of this registry is to collect European demographic, procedural and outcome data using OverStitch for a variety of procedures including closure of full thickness and mucosal defects, post-operative leaks, perforations, stent fixation, treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding and other procedures. The goal is to support the clinical use and benefits of endolumenal suturing as well as provide real-world data on safety and effectiveness which can support physicians, patients and payers in making informed decisions. This registry could extend up to five years and both registries will provide interim reporting.
 Additional applications for endoscopic suturing are emerging as physicians gain suturing proficiency and identify additional patient needs. In June 2018, Endoscopy International published for example a study of a novel resection and plication anti-reflux procedure ("RAP") using OverStitch. In this patient series, RAP was performed on 10 patients with gastroesophageal reflex disease ("GERD") and on long-term proton pump inhibitor ("PPI") therapy. All the patients underwent RAP without adverse events and were discharged on the same day. Follow-up ranged from 5 to 24 months, with the median being 9 months, and all patients were reported as having significant improvement in their GERD based quality of life scores, and 8 of the 10 patients had eliminated their daily PPI use. 
Orbera Intragastric Balloon System
 The intragastric balloon system ("IGB", the "Orbera System" or "Orbera") is currently marketed under three brands: the Orbera Intragastric Balloon System, the BIB, and the Orbera365 Managed Weight Loss System ("Orbera365") and are non-surgical alternatives for the treatment of overweight and obese adults. Orbera is the global market leader among intragastric balloons and is available in over 70 countries with more than 300,000 units distributed in the period from January 1, 2006 to March 31, 2018. The IGB brands each include a single silicone balloon that is filled with saline after its endoscopic transoral placement into the patient's stomach. Once in the patient's stomach, the balloon serves to reduce stomach capacity, causing patients to consume less following the procedure, and delay gastric emptying, the primary mechanisms of action in assisting the patient in losing weight. Placement of the balloon is temporary and is removed endoscopically, typically, under conscious sedation. 
 In the U.S., Orbera is indicated for an indwell period of up to six months for adults within a BMI range of 30 to 40 who have tried other weight loss programs, such as supervised diet and exercise, but who were unable to lose weight and keep it off. Outside the U.S., Orbera is generally indicated for temporary weight loss for patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 27, and depending on the specific label, is indicated for an indwell time of six or twelve months. In some cases, generally higher BMI patients, Orbera is indicated for use prior to surgery, including obesity surgery, in order to reduce surgical risk. 
 Today, IGBs are most often used for aesthetic weight loss purposes rather than to specifically treat a patient's advancing comorbidity related with obesity. Because of this, the IGB procedure is typically not covered by insurance and is paid for out of pocket by the patient.
 However, specific to Orbera, there is a substantial and increasing body of evidence that shows that the level of weight loss with Orbera is very effective in the treatment of comorbidities associated with being overweight or obese. The clinical effectiveness and safety profile of the Orbera System as a non-ulcerogenic weight loss device has been reported in over 250 peer reviewed publications. Although not specifically indicated for the treatment of obesity-related comorbidities, studies have consistently reported resolution or improvement in a patient's pre-existing comorbidities at the time of Orbera removal. Orbera is currently the only balloon or other endoscopic product that has been recognized in the ASGE Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable Endoscopic Innovations assessment to have met its threshold standards for the treatment of obesity. The meta-analysis performed by the ASGE was based on the aggregation of certain clinical studies conducted outside the U.S. and reported an estimated TBWL at six months of approximately 13.2%.

 For example in June 2018 during Digestive Disease Week, physicians from Mayo Clinic presented on their prospective open-label FDA-approved study of Orbera patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ("NASH"). Of the patients treated, 65% achieved resolution of NASH on biopsy; 80% had at least a two point improvement in their non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score; 15% had tissue evidence indicating regression of fibrosis (liver scarring). NASH is expected to become the most common cause of liver cirrhosis by 2030, leading to increased risk of liver-related death and higher rates of malignancy.
 Our commercial strategy is to further establish the medical relevancy of Orbera in areas of large medical need such as fatty liver disease and increase market awareness of this relevancy.
 The Orbera System was originally CE marked in May 1997. Orbera365 was CE marked in August 2017. After February 2019, only Orbera365 and BIB will be CE marked.
 Orbera was approved by the FDA in August 2015. From FDA approval through the end of 2018, we have trained more than 1,000 U.S. physicians on the use of Orbera.
 As part of the FDA approval of Orbera, we are required to conduct a post-approval clinical study. The Orbera Post-Approval Study is a prospective, multi-center, open-label study of the safety and effectiveness of Orbera as an adjunct to weight reduction for obese adults (22 years of age and older) with a BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m2 and BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2.  The Orbera Post Approval Study completed enrollment in September 2018 with 281 patients treated with the Orbera from 11 U.S. clinical study sites. The endpoints include the patient's percentage of total body weight loss at 26 weeks and 12 months after balloon placement and the rate of adverse events at 26 weeks. Patient follow up is expected to be completed in late 2019 and final study results are expected in early 2020.
 In February 2017, the FDA issued a letter to health care providers related to adverse events following placement of liquid-filled balloons which were not seen during the U.S. pivotal studies, specifically related to events of spontaneous balloon over-inflation and, separately, reports of acute pancreatitis.  We subsequently developed updates to Orbera's product labeling and physician training materials, and these were approved by FDA and implemented in June 2017. The labeling changes included additions to the “Warnings” and “Possible Complications” sections and an update to the “Clinical Evaluations…” sub-section within the “Adverse Events” history for Orbera. 
 In August 2017, the FDA issued a second update to alert health care providers of five reports of unanticipated deaths that occurred since 2016 in patients with a liquid-filled intragastric balloon implant. Four of the deaths involved patients who had received an Orbera and had been self-reported by us to the FDA as part of our normal product surveillance process. Following this letter, we interactively worked with the FDA to provide further updates regarding the risks of gastric and esophageal perforation, aspiration, and death and updated the label disclosure for these adverse events as per the table below:

 | Global Rate (as of March 31, 2017) | Global Rate (as of March 31, 2018)
Mortality Rate | 0.01% | | <0.01%
Gastric Perforation | 0.01% | | 0.01% 
Esophageal Perforation | <0.01% | | <0.01%
Pancreatitis | <0.01% | | <0.01%
Spontaneous Hyperinflation | 0.04% | | 0.07% 

 In addition, The U.S. physician training material was updated to provide physicians with more detailed descriptions of the patient symptoms that may indicate persistent (or refractory) intolerance, methods of assessing these patients, and recommendations for the management of symptoms and removal of the device.
 In June 2018, the FDA approved the new Orbera labeling and concurrent with their approval issued a third update to alert health care providers of the label updates and provide an update on new reports worldwide of unanticipated deaths that had been reported since their August 2017 letter to Health Care Providers. Four of the reported deaths in this third update involved patients who had received our IGB product. In each case, the occurrence had been self-reported by us to the FDA as part of our normal product surveillance process. As stated in the Orbera Directions For Use in the period from January 1, 2006 through March 31, 2017, there had been 21 reported deaths of patients while they had an Orbera which is an incident rate of less than 0.01% based on the more than 277,000 Orbera balloons distributed during that same time period.  The FDA’s letter to Health Care Providers does not indicate that the patient deaths were related to the Orbera device or the insertion procedures. While the cause of death has not been provided or determined in all cases, we have not received any communication or indication from the attending physicians or hospitals that the reported deaths were caused by the Orbera device. In total, Apollo has reported five instances of death involving patients who had received an Orbera since FDA approval in August 2015 with four of the incidents occurring outside the U.S.; the overall incident rate of patient death remains less than 0.01% (one in 10,000).
 In the U.S., we also introduced Orbera Coach, an on-demand telehealth program that provides professional nutritionist support to patients who undergo the Orbera procedure for an annual fee.
Surgical
 In December 2018, Apollo entered into an agreement with ReShape to divest its Surgical product line. As part of the agreement Apollo and ReShape entered into a set of transition services agreements under which Apollo will continue to distribute the products in markets outside the U.S. for up to 12 months and will continue to manufacture the Surgical product line for up to two years. Our Surgical products consisted of the Lap-Band System and accessories primarily used in laparoscopic bariatric surgeries. The Lap-Band System is designed to provide minimally invasive long-term treatment of severe obesity and is an alternative to more invasive surgical stapling procedures such as the gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. The Lap-Band System is an adjustable silicone band that is laparoscopically placed around the upper part of the stomach through a small incision, creating a small pouch at the top of the stomach, which slows the passage of food and creates a sensation of fullness. The procedure can normally be performed as an outpatient procedure, where the patient is able to go home the day of the procedure without the need for an overnight hospital stay.
 The Lap-Band System has been in use in Europe since 1993 and was CE marked in 1997. FDA approval in the U.S. was obtained in 2001 and the Lap-Band System has been approved in many countries around the world. Nearly 900,000 Lap-Band Systems have been distributed worldwide.
 The Lap-Band System was approved for use in the U.S. for patients with BMI greater than or equal to 40 or a BMI greater than or equal to 35 with one or more severe comorbid conditions. In 2011, the U.S. FDA granted approval for an expanded indication for the Lap-Band System to include patients with a BMI in the range of 30 to 35 and with one or more comorbid conditions. 
Competition
 We face competition from other interventional therapies for the treatment of obesity that do not use our products as well as from other manufacturers with similar products to ours with the same intended mode of action.
 Competing therapies are primarily surgical in nature, such as sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass. Sleeve gastrectomy is a surgical weight-loss procedure in which the stomach is reduced to about 15% of its original size, by the longitudinal resection and removal of a large portion of the stomach along the greater curvature. The result is a sleeve or tube like structure. The procedure permanently reduces the size of the stomach. The procedure is generally performed laparoscopically and is irreversible. Gastric bypass surgery refers to a surgical procedure in which the stomach is divided into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower remnant pouch and then the small intestine is rerouted to connect to the small upper pouch. The procedure leads to a marked reduction in the functional volume of the stomach, accompanied by an altered physiological and physical response to food. Both procedures are normally performed laparoscopically and rely upon surgical staplers as their principal surgical tool. As a result, these procedures are supported by the suppliers of surgical staplers, the largest of whom are Johnson & Johnson (Ethicon) and Medtronic (Covidien). Both companies have substantially more resources than we do.
 We are the only manufacturer with a cleared device for full thickness endoscopic suturing currently on the market in the U.S. or outside the U.S. Competing technologies for closure during certain GI defect applications are offered by large and established manufacturers in the GI space including Boston Scientific Corporation, Olympus Medical, Steris (US Endoscopy) and Cook Medical. Outside the U.S., there are a variety of local and regional competitive intragastric balloon manufacturers
 including SC MedSil, Medicone, Allurion Technologies and Spatz Laboratories. In the U.S., there is one other manufacturer with an intragastric balloon approved by the FDA at this time, Obalon Therapeutics, Inc. 
Sales and Distribution
 We currently market and sell our products principally to providers of medical services and procedures including hospitals, outpatient surgical centers, clinics and physicians through an employee sales force in the U.S., Brazil, Australia and certain countries in Europe. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 46 sales and marketing personnel in the U.S. and another 41 employees in all of the markets outside of the U.S. In addition, we sell products to third party distributors who sell our products in approximately 65 other countries.
 Obesity procedures that utilize our Endo-bariatric products are generally cash pay procedures. Revisions of prior bariatric surgery using endoscopic suturing have received reimbursement approval on a case-by-case basis. Medical procedures that utilize endoscopic suturing products in the treatment of GI defects generally receive reimbursement approval, but coverage can vary by country, state and procedure performed.
Manufacturing and Product Supply
 We manage all aspects of product supply through our operations team based in Austin, Texas. We operate a manufacturing facility in the Coyol Free Trade Zone in Alajuela, Costa Rica that initially performed final assembly for the Lap-Band and Orbera products. Beginning in 2016, we started to produce components related to the OverStitch system at this facility and have expanded the number and volume of OverStitch system products and components produced in Costa Rica since then and will continue to increase production in the coming year. In addition, we rely on several third-party suppliers to provide components used in existing products and we expect to continue to do so, including final assembly of the OverStitch and OverStitch Sx endoscopic suturing system.
 In December 2018, Apollo and ReShape Lifesciences, Inc., entered into a set of transition services agreements under which we will continue to manufacture the Surgical product line for ReShape for up to two years and would continue distributing products in markets outside the U.S. for up to 12 months, and other specified services as part of the Purchase Agreement.
 We believe that our existing manufacturing facilities give us the necessary physical capacity to produce sufficient quantities of products to meet anticipated demand for at least the next twelve months. Our manufacturing facility is certified by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and operates under the FDA's good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices set forth in the Quality System Regulation, ("QSR").
Intellectual Property
 We have developed and acquired significant know-how and proprietary technology, upon which our business depends. To protect our know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on trade secret laws, patents, copyrights, trademarks and confidentiality agreements and contracts. However, these methods afford only limited protection. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or technology, gain access to our trade secrets or disclose or use such secrets or technology without our approval.
 We protect trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. We cannot assure you that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors.
 Apart from the portfolio of patents and applications to the Lpath technology, we own over 97 U.S. patents and 115 foreign patents. Our U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2035 and our foreign patents have expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2034 subject to the payment of the requisite renewal fees. We also own 40 pending U.S. patent applications and 58 pending foreign patent applications. We believe patents will be issued pursuant to such applications but cannot guarantee it. Moreover, neither the timing of any issuance, the scope of protection, nor the actual issue date of these pending applications can be forecasted with precision. Where we have acquired or licensed patent rights from third parties, we are generally required to pay royalties. While our patents are an important element of our products and future product development, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent.
 Our patents may not provide us with effective competitive advantages. Our pending or future patent applications may not be issued. Others may hold or obtain patents that cover aspects or uses of our innovations. The patents of others may render our patents obsolete, limit our ability to patent or practice our innovations, or otherwise have an adverse effect on the ability to conduct business. Because foreign patents may afford less protection than U.S. patents, they may not adequately protect our technology in markets outside the U.S.
 In 2009, we entered into an Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement, with Olympus Corporation and the "FTE Group" comprised of The Johns Hopkins University, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, The University of Texas Medical Branch, MUSC Foundation for Research Development and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, whereby the FTE Group has assigned to us a Joint Research Agreement with Olympus Corporation, including their rights in certain inventions, patents and IP rights developed by FTE Group under the Joint Research Agreement, which relate to the field of flexible endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery. Olympus Corporation has retained rights as a joint owner of certain inventions and related patents developed jointly by FTE Group and Olympus Corporation under the Joint Research Agreement and retained a license granted by FTE Group to Olympus Corporation to the inventions and related patents developed by FTE Group under the Joint Research Agreement. The patents covered by the agreement pertain to endoscopic procedures and endoscopic suturing devices that relate to the OverStitch products and may also be incorporated into potential new products that we may develop in the future. As consideration for the assignment, we are obligated to pay to each of Olympus and the FTE Group one half of a royalty in the low single digits on net sales of our products covered by the patents, which royalty shall be reduced if related patents have expired or no longer exist. In addition, we have the right to sublicense our rights under the Joint Research Agreement to the patents and technologies. The term of the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement is through and until termination. The agreement may be terminated upon written notice a) by Olympus if we materially breach any material terms that pertain to Olympus and the breach is not cured within 30 days after notice, b) by the FTE Group if we materially breach any of the material terms that pertain to the FTE Group and the breach is not cured within 30 days after notice or c) by us if Olympus materially breaches any material terms that pertain to Olympus and the breach is not cured within 30 days after notice.
 Following the Merger, we also own 47 U.S. and foreign issued patents and 29 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications relating to technologies and inventions developed by Lpath prior to the Merger (the “Lpath IP”). The Lpath IP is not aligned with our current business activities. In January 2018, we entered into a royalty-bearing License Agreement with Echelon Biosciences, Inc., ("Echelon") under which Echelon may manufacture and sell certain antibody products covered by the Lpath IP for non-clinical research use only, clinical diagnostics and immunohistochemistry. In January 2018 we also entered into a Technology Transfer Agreement with Resolute Pharma, Inc. (“Resolute”) whereby we transferred certain scientific and research materials to Resolute and granted Resolute a license to certain patent rights related to the Lpath IP. Under the terms of the agreement with Resolute, Resolute has obligations to develop and commercialize licensed products and we maintain rights to terminate the agreement if certain development and commercialization milestones are not met. Under the agreement, Resolute is responsible to pay for any ongoing costs and fees associated with the Lpath IP, and we are entitled to a royalty for any revenues related to the Lpath IP including sales of licensed products, and a Tech Transfer Fee of $0.5 million by July 31, 2019 which increases to $0.75 million if paid after this date. In addition, Resolute has a certain buyout option for the Licensed Patents or Licensed Products.
Government Regulation
 The healthcare industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.
 Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (or "FD&C Act") also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a premarket approval ("PMA") application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
Device Classification
 Under the FD&C Act, medical devices are classified into one of three classes - Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
 Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements. 
 Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and postmarket surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k)
 premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is "substantially equivalent," as defined in the statute, to either:
•a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or 
•another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process.
 To be "substantially equivalent," the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured.
 Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification, including modification to or deviation from design, manufacturing processes, materials, packaging and sterilization that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer's determination. If the FDA requires a new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, the applicant may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until clearance or approval is received. In addition, in these circumstances, the FDA can impose significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite 510(k) or PMA application(s). 
 If the FDA determines that the device is not "substantially equivalent" to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. Pursuant to amendments to the statute in 2012, a manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
 Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA's satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA's satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
 The Orbera intragastric balloons are Class III devices. The OverStitch device is a Class II device. We also sell accessory products, some of which are Class I.
The Investigational Device Process
 In the U.S., absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") application. Some types of studies deemed to present "non-significant risk" are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and IRB approval is obtained. If the device presents a "significant risk" to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. There
 can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA's approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product's safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
 All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA's IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA's regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable, or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a 510(k), for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
•the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold; 
•patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected; 
•patients do not comply with trial protocols; 
•patient follow-up is not at the rate expected; 
•patients experience adverse events; 
•patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of the trial; 
•device malfunctions occur with unexpected frequency or potential adverse consequences; 
•side effects or device malfunctions of similar products already in the market that change the FDA's view toward approval of new or similar PMAs or clearance of a 510(k) or result in the imposition of new requirements or testing; 
•institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol; 
•third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, investigator agreement, investigational plan, good clinical practices, the IDE regulations or other FDA or IRB requirements; 
•third-party investigators are disqualified by the FDA; 
•data collection, monitoring and analysis is not performed in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans, or otherwise fail to comply with the IDE regulations governing responsibilities, records and reports of sponsors of clinical investigations; 
•third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or our study such that the FDA deems the study results unreliable, or the company or investigators fail to disclose such interests;
•regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials; 
•changes in government regulations or administrative actions; 
•the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; or 
•the FDA concludes that our trial design is unreliable or inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
The PMA Approval Process   
 Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant's response to deficiencies communicated by the
 FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (e.g., major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee's recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, and a QSR inspection of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application is to take 180 days, although the review generally takes between one and three years, or longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
•the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA's satisfaction; 
•the data from pre-clinical studies and/or clinical trials may be found unreliable or insufficient to support approval; 
•the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and 
•changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
 If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA's evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data are submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.
 New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modification to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, components, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
 In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may also require some form of postmarket studies or postmarket surveillance, whereby the applicant follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may require postmarket surveillance for certain devices approved under a PMA or cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life-sustaining devices used outside a device user facility, devices where the failure of which would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences, or devices expected to have significant use in pediatric populations. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
 After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•the FDA's QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
•labeling regulations, unique device identification requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses; 
•advertising and promotion requirements; 
•restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device; 
•PMA annual reporting requirements; 
•PMA approval or clearance of a 510(k) for product modifications; 
•medical device reporting ("MDR"), regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
•medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health; 
•recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; 
•device tracking requirements; and 
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
 We have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained authorization to manufacture from the FDA. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA Office of Compliance within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health to determine our compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Our business is regulated by laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by significant criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Because of the far-reaching nature of these laws, we may be required to alter one or more of our practices to remain in compliance with these laws. Evolving interpretations of current laws, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could adversely affect arrangements with customers and physicians. In addition, any violation of these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of our operations.
Anti-Kickback Statute
 Subject to a number of statutory exceptions, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the furnishing, recommending, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for, a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including payments to physicians or other providers, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything of value at less than fair market value. The Office of the Inspector General ("OIG") of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") are responsible for enforcing the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the OIG is primarily responsible for identifying fraud and abuse activities affecting government healthcare programs.
  Penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include substantial criminal fines and/or imprisonment, substantial civil fines and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by government healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and do not include comparable exceptions to those provided by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
 The OIG has issued safe harbor regulations that identify activities and business relationships that are not treated as offenses under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These safe harbors exist for various types of arrangements, including certain investment interests, leases, personal service arrangements, discounts and management contracts. The failure of a particular activity to comply with all requirements of an applicable safe harbor regulation does not mean that the activity violates the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or that prosecution will be pursued. However, activities and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG.
 In recent years, the federal government and several states have enacted legislation requiring biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device companies to establish marketing compliance programs and file periodic reports on sales, marketing and other activities. Similar legislation is being considered in other states. Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and
 available guidance is limited. We could face enforcement action, fines and other penalties and could receive adverse publicity, all of which could harm our business, if it is alleged that we have failed to fully comply with such laws and regulations. Similarly, if the physicians or other providers or entities that we do business with are found to have not complied with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on our business.
Federal False Claims Act
 The federal False Claims Act ("FCA") prohibits knowingly filing or causing the filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. A claim that is filed pursuant to an unlawful kickback may be a false claim under this law and, in a number of cases, manufacturers of medical products have entered into settlements based on FCA allegations that their financial relationships with customers "caused" these customers to submit false claims. When an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. Private individuals can file suits under the FCA on behalf of the government. These lawsuits are known as "qui tam" actions, and the individuals bringing such suits, sometimes known as "relators" or, more commonly, "whistleblowers," may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Since complaints related to “qui tam” actions are initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before a defendant is even aware of such action. Thus, we may currently be subject to an investigation for alleged FCA violations pursuant to one or more qui tam actions, which may be under full or partial seal, thereby preventing disclosure of such action or actions at this time. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal FCA. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action. The time and expense associated with responding to such investigations, and any related qui tam or other actions, may be extensive, and we cannot predict the results of our review of the responsive documents and underlying facts or the results of such actions. The costs of responding to government investigations, defending any claims raised, and any resulting fines, restitution, damages and penalties (including under the FCA), settlement payments or administrative actions, as well as any related actions brought by stockholders or other third parties, could have a material impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.
HIPAA
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.
 HIPAA also protects the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates. HIPAA restricts the use and disclosure of patient health information, including patient records. Although we believe that HIPAA does not apply directly to us, most of our customers have significant obligations under HIPAA, and we intend to cooperate with customers and others to ensure compliance with HIPAA with respect to patient information. Failure to comply with HIPAA obligations can result in civil fines and/or criminal penalties. Some states have also enacted rigorous laws or regulations protecting the security and privacy of patient information. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face additional sanctions.
Healthcare Reform and Compliance 
 In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ("ACA"). The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes. Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a medical device excise tax on U.S. sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013. We began paying the medical device excise tax in January 2013.
 In December 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 was implemented, which suspended the medical device excise tax implemented as part of the ACA for a two-year period through December 31, 2017. In January 2018, the moratorium on the medical device tax was extended an additional two years, through the end of 2019.
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act ("PPSA"), which is part of the ACA, requires manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted in several states, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have
 adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals. Particularly, some states such as Massachusetts and Vermont impose an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. We are current with all required reports under the PPSA.
 Additionally, the compliance environment is changing, with more states, such as California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts, mandating implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, and spending limits, and other states, such as Vermont, requiring reporting to state governments of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting regulatory environment, along with the requirement to comply in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements, increases the possibility that a company may run afoul of one or more laws.
International Regulation
 Our business is also subject to regulation in each of the foreign countries in which our products are sold. Many of the regulations applicable to our products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. The European Union ("EU") requires that medical devices comply with the Medical Device Directive or the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, which includes quality system and CE certification requirements. To obtain a CE Mark in the EU, defined products must meet minimum standards of safety and quality (i.e., the essential requirements) and then undergo an appropriate conformity assessment procedure. A Notified Body assesses the quality management systems of the manufacturer and verifies the conformity of devices to the essential and other requirements within the Medical Device Directive. In the EU, we are also required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell products. We are also subject to regulations and periodic review from various regulatory bodies in other countries where our products are sold. Lack of regulatory compliance in any of these jurisdictions could limit our ability to distribute products in these countries. We are also subject to foreign laws and regulations governing the marketing and promotion of our products including transparency reporting obligations.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are, either directly or indirectly, with governmental entities and employees (such as physicians at state-owned or state-operated hospitals) and are therefore subject to various anti-bribery laws. Although our corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we sell to customers in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our policies and procedures are designed to both prevent as well as detect reckless or criminal acts committed by employees, distributors, consultants, or agents, but such controls, policies, and procedures may not always protect us from violations. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Other Regulations
 We are also subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to such matters as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research and development and manufacturing activities. Specifically, the manufacture of our products is subject to compliance with various international and federal laws and regulations and by various foreign, state and local agencies. Although we believe we are in compliance with these laws and regulations in all material respects, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with these and other laws or regulations in the future.
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 215 full-time employees. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Our non-U.S. employment contracts comply with the applicable country mandated collective agreement in the locations where we operate. We have never experienced any work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
