ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of the Business
Franklin Electric Co., Inc. (“Franklin Electric” or the “Company”) is an Indiana corporation founded in 1944 and incorporated in 1946. Named after America’s pioneer electrical engineer, Benjamin Franklin, Franklin Electric manufactured the first water-lubricated submersible motor for water systems and the first submersible motor for fueling systems. With 2021 revenue of about $1.7 billion, the Company designs, manufactures and distributes water and fuel pumping systems, composed primarily of submersible motors, pumps, electronic controls, water treatment systems and related parts and equipment.
The Company’s water pumping systems move fresh and wastewater for the residential, agricultural, and other industrial end markets. The Company also sells various groundwater equipment products to well installation contractors, including water pumping systems, through its distribution branches located in the U.S. With a growing global footprint, the Company has also evolved into a top supplier of submersible fueling systems at gas stations, making pumps, pipes, electronic controls, and monitoring devices.
The Company’s products are sold worldwide by its employee sales force and independent manufacturing representatives. The Company offers normal and customary trade terms to its customers, no significant part of which is of an extended nature. Special inventory requirements are not necessary, and customer merchandise return rights do not extend beyond normal warranty provisions.
Franklin Electric’s Key Factors for Success
While maintaining a culture of safety and lean principles, Franklin Electric promises to deliver quality, availability, service, innovation, and cost in every encounter the Company has with stakeholders, including direct or indirect customers, employees, shareholders, and suppliers. These key factors for success are a roadmap for the Company's growth as a global provider of water and fuel systems, through geographic expansion and product line extensions, leveraging its global platform and competency in system design, all while consistently offering the best value to its customer.
Markets and Applications
The Company’s business consists of three reportable segments based on the principal end market served: Water Systems, Fueling Systems, and Distribution segments. The Company includes unallocated corporate expenses in an “Intersegment Eliminations/Other” segment that, together with the Water Systems, Fueling Systems, and Distribution segments, represent the Company. Segment and geographic information appears in Note 15 - Segment and Geographic Information to the consolidated financial statements.
The market for the Company’s products is highly competitive and includes diversified accounts by size and type. The Company’s Water Systems and Fueling Systems products and related equipment are sold to specialty distributors and some original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), as well as industrial and petroleum equipment distributors and major oil and utility companies. The Company’s Distribution segment sells products primarily to water well contractors. 
Water Systems Segment
Water Systems is a global leader in the production and marketing of water pumping systems and is a technical leader in submersible motors, pumps, drives, electronic controls, water treatment systems, and monitoring devices. The Water Systems segment designs, manufactures and sells motors, pumps, drives, electronic controls, monitoring devices, and related parts and equipment primarily for use in groundwater, water transfer and wastewater. 
Water Systems motors, pumps and controls are used principally for pumping clean water and wastewater in a variety of residential, agricultural, municipal and industrial applications. Water Systems also manufactures electronic drives and controls for the motors which control functionality and provide protection from various hazards, such as electrical surges, over-heating and dry wells or dry tanks. In the last three years, the Company acquired First Sales, LLC; Waterite, Inc.; Puronics, Inc.; New Aqua, LLC; and B&R Industries, Inc. expanding its portfolio to include water treatment systems and acquired Minetuff Dewatering Pumps Australia Pty Ltd expanding its industrial dewatering product line.
Water Systems products are sold in highly competitive markets. Water Systems contributes about 60 percent of the Company’s total revenue. Significant portions of segment revenue come from selling groundwater and surface pumps, motors, and controls for residential and commercial buildings, as well as agricultural sales which are more seasonal and subject to commodity price changes. The Water Systems segment generates approximately 30 to 35 percent of its revenue in developing markets, which often lack municipal water systems. As those countries install water systems, the Company views those markets as an 
opportunity. The Company has had 6 to 9 percent compounded annual sales growth in developing regions in recent years. Water Systems competes in each of its targeted markets based on product design, quality of products and services, performance, availability, and price. The Company’s principal competitors in the specialty water products industry are Grundfos Management A/S, Pentair, Inc. and Xylem, Inc.
2021 Water Systems research and development expenditures were primarily related to the following activities:
•Electronic variable frequency drives and controls for Pump and HVAC applications, including the development of SubDrive Connect and Cerus X-Drive to include support for HES (High Efficiency Systems) motor
