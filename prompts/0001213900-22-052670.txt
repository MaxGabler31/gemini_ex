Significant Factors Relating to PRC Government Oversight of Our Operating Businesses.



Due to our operations in China, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by economic, political, legal and social conditions in the PRC or changes in government relations between China and the United States or other governments. There is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. China’s economy differs from the economies of other countries in many respects, including with respect to the level of development, growth rate, amount of government involvement, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While China’s economy has experienced significant growth over the past four decades, growth has been uneven across different regions and among various economic sectors. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are currently applicable to us. In addition, in the past the Chinese government implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to manage the pace of economic growth and prevent the economy from overheating. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.



Additionally, the Chinese government has published new policies that significantly affect certain industries such as the education and internet industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding our industry that could require us to obtain additional permission from Chinese authorities to continue to operate our business in China, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, statements made by the Chinese government have indicated an intent to increase the government’s oversight and control over offerings of companies with significant operations in China that are to be conducted in foreign markets.



In light of such developments, the SEC has imposed enhanced disclosure requirements on China-based companies seeking to register securities with the SEC. Any future PRC, U.S. or other rules and regulations that place restrictions on capital raising or other activities by companies with extensive operations in China could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any such action, once taken by the Chinese government, could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors, and could cause the value of our Common Stock to significantly decline or become worthless. If the business environment in China deteriorates from the perspective of domestic or international investment, or if relations between China and the United States or other governments deteriorate, our business in China and United States may also be adversely affected. For more details, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China— Changes in the political and economic policies of the PRC government or in relations between China and the United States or other governments may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and may result in our inability to sustain our growth and expansion strategies.”



The PRC government’s significant authority in regulating our operations and its oversight could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to conduct our business. Implementation of industry-wide regulations, including data security or anti-monopoly related regulations, may cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be of little or no value. For more details, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—The PRC government’s oversight over our business operation could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities.”



Risks and uncertainties arising from the legal system in China, including risks and uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws and quickly evolving rules and regulations in China, could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our Common Stock. For more details, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China— Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system and the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to you and us or result in a material adverse change to our subsidiaries’ business operations, and damage our and our subsidiaries’ reputation, which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause our Common Stock to significantly decline in value or become worthless.”



Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and Related Legislation and Regulations



As part of a continued regulatory focus in the U.S. on access to audit and other information currently protected by national law, in particular China’s, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the “HFCAA”) was signed into law on December 18, 2020. The HFCAA states if the SEC determines that if a company has filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit such company’s securities from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the U.S. Accordingly, under the current law, this could happen in 2024 if the SEC makes this determination for three consecutive years. 



On March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. A company will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies it as having a “non-inspection” year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. The SEC is assessing how to implement other requirements of the HFCAA, including the listing and trading prohibition requirements described above.





3







On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed a bill known as the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the” AHFCAA”) to amend Section 104(i) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to prohibit securities of any registrant from being listed on any of the U.S. securities exchanges or traded over-the-counter if the auditor of the registrant’s financial statements is not subject to PCAOB inspection for two consecutive years, instead of three consecutive years as currently enacted in the HFCAA.



On December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions.



Additionally, in October 2021, Nasdaq adopted additional listing criteria applicable to companies that primarily operate in jurisdictions where local regulators impose secrecy laws, national security laws or other laws that restrict U.S. regulators from accessing information relating to the issuer (a “Restrictive Market”). Under the new rule, whether a jurisdiction permits PCAOB inspection would be a factor in determining whether a jurisdiction is deemed by Nasdaq to be a Restrictive Market. China will likely be determined to be a Restrictive Market and, as a result, Nasdaq may impose on additional continued listing criteria or deny continued listing of our securities on Nasdaq, and we cannot assure you whether Nasdaq or regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor’s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to our audit.



On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a determination report which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in: (i) China, and (ii) Hong Kong, because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions, and the PCAOB included in the report of its determination a list of the accounting firms that are headquartered in the PRC or Hong Kong. This report does not include our auditors, Audit Alliance LLP. Audit Alliance LLP is headquartered in Singapore and there are no limitations in Singapore on PCAOB inspections. However, to the extent that our auditor’s work papers may, in the future, become located in China, such work papers will not be subject to inspection by the PCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities. Inspections of certain other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms’ audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of our auditors’ work papers in China would make it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor’s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections. As a result, our investors may be deprived of the benefits of the PCAOB’s oversight of our auditor through such inspections and they may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements. We cannot assure you whether Nasdaq or other regulatory authorities will apply additional or more stringent criteria to us. Such uncertainty could cause the market price of our shares to be materially and adversely affected.



We will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies us as having a “non-inspection” year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. The SEC is assessing how to implement other requirements of the HFCAA, including the listing and trading prohibition requirements described above. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 and through the date of this Annual Report, our auditor did not have any documentation related to their audit reports located in China. However, to the extent that our independent registered public accounting firm’s audit documentation related to their audit reports for the Company may be located in China in the future, the PCAOB may not be able to inspect such audit documentation and, as a result, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection.



On February 4, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in Technology and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act of 2022 (the “America COMPETES Act”), which similarly would amend the HFCAA to shorten the three-year period to two years. The America COMPETES Act, however, includes a broader range of legislation than the AHFCA Act in response to the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (the “USICA”) passed by the U.S. Senate in 2021. In late July 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate passed the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (“CHIPS”) for America Fund (the “CHIPS Act of 2022”), which is expected to be signed into law in August 2022. The CHIPS Act of 2022 includes a number of provisions from both the America COMPETES Act and the USICA but did not include a provision to amend the HFCAA to shorten the three-year period to two years.





4







Certain members of the U.S. Senate have mentioned that they intend to move forward with negotiating the remaining provisions from the AHFCA and the America Competes Act that were not included in the CHIPS Act of 2022 and there is a chance that a final bill from this negotiation, if approved, could amend the HFCAA to shorten the three-year period to two years. It is unclear if or when this amended bill will be signed into law. In the case that such bill becomes the law, it will reduce the time period before our shares of Common Stock could be delisted from Nasdaq and prohibited from over-the-counter trading in the U.S. from 2024 to 2023.



On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China – the first step toward opening access for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong completely, consistent with U.S. law. While this Statement of Protocol may lead to full resolution of the previously identified issues, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In such an event, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to comply with the requirements imposed by the U.S. regulators or Nasdaq. Delisting of our Common Stock would force holders of shares of our Common Stock to sell their Common Stock. The market price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected as a result of anticipated negative impacts of these executive or legislative actions upon, as well as negative investor sentiment towards, companies with significant operations in China that are listed in the United States, regardless of whether these executive or legislative actions are implemented and regardless of our actual operating performance. The delisting of our shares, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of an investment in our shares. Additionally, the inability of the PCAOB to conduct adequate inspections would deprive our shareholders of the benefits of such inspections. “See “Item 1A - Risk Factors- Risks Related to Doing Business in China - Our shares may be delisted under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the PCAOB is unable to inspect our auditors for three consecutive years beginning in 2021” and “The potential enactment of the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act or the America Competes Act would decrease the number of non-inspection years from three years to two, thus reducing the time period before our shares of Common Stock may be prohibited from over-the-counter trading or delisted.



Recent Regulatory Developments in China



The PRC government has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of the business operations of our PRC subsidiaries or to exert control over any offering of securities conducted overseas and may intervene with or influence our operations, may limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, and may cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless, as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals.



Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation of business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement.



Among other things, the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the “M&A Rules”) and Anti-Monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China (“SCNPC”) which became effective in 2008 (“Anti-Monopoly Law”), established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex. Such regulation requires, among other things, that the State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor acquires control of a PRC domestic enterprise or a foreign company with substantial PRC operations, if certain thresholds under the Provisions of the State Council on the Standard for Declaration of Concentration of Business Operators, issued by the State Council in 2008, are triggered. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law requires that transactions which involve the national security, the examination on the national security shall also be conducted according to the relevant provisions of the State. In addition, the PRC Measures for the Security Review of Foreign Investment which became effective in January 2021 require acquisitions by foreign investors of PRC companies engaged in military-related or certain other industries that are crucial to national security be subject to security review before consummation of any such acquisition.





5







In January 2020, SAMR sought public comments on the Draft Amendment to the Anti-Monopoly Law which include significantly harsher penalties and fines for certain violations, modifications to the merger review process, and additional clarification of the law surrounding certain types of conduct, including the requirement to file a prior notification with The Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China (“MOFCOM”). On October 23, 2021, the SCNPC issued a second draft amendment to the amended Anti-Monopoly Law for public comments, which proposes to increase the fines for illegal concentration of business operators to “no more than ten percent of its preceding year’s sales revenue if the concentration of business operator has or may have an effect of excluding or limiting competition; or a fine of up to RMB 5 million if the concentration of business operator does not have an effect of excluding or limiting competition.” The draft also proposes for the relevant authority to investigate a transaction where there is evidence that the concentration has or may have the effect of eliminating or restricting competition, even if such concentration does not reach the filing threshold. Under the proposed turnover thresholds, a filing would be required if one party’s turnover in China exceeds 100 billion yuan (approx. $14.9 billion) and the other party has a market value greater than 800 million yuan (approx. $120 million) and generates more than one-third of its global turnover within China.



In addition, PRC national security review rules, i.e. Provisions of Ministry of Commerce on Implementation of Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, which became effective in September 2011 and Notice of the General Office of State Council on Establishment of Security Review System Pertaining to Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, which became effective in March 2011, require acquisitions by foreign investors of PRC companies engaged in military related or certain other industries that are crucial to national security be subject to security review before consummation of any such acquisition. We believe that our businesses are not in an industry related to national security. However, we cannot preclude the possibility that MOFCOM or other government agencies may publish interpretations contrary to our understanding or broaden the scope of the security review in the future.



Moreover, the Administrative Measures for Enterprises’ Overseas Investment, or the Overseas Investment Rules, adopted by the National Development and Reform Commission of the People’s Republic of China (“NDRC”) on December 26, 2017 and became effective on March 1, 2018, stipulates that for local enterprises (enterprises that are not managed by the state government), if the amount of investment made by the Chinese investors is less than US$300 million and the target project is non-sensitive, then the overseas investment project will require filing, instead of approval, with the local branch of the CSRC where the enterprise itself is registered.



Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval processes may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions. It is unclear whether our business would be deemed to be in an industry that raises “national defense and security” or “national security” concerns. However, MOFCOM, NDRC and other government agencies may publish explanations in the future determining that our business is in an industry subject to the security review, in which case our future acquisitions in the PRC may be closely scrutinized or prohibited. Our ability to expand our business or maintain or expand our market share through future acquisitions would as such be materially and adversely affected.



On July 6, 2021, the relevant PRC government authorities made public the “Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities in Accordance with the Law.” The opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas listings by China-based companies and proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies. Official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued yet and the interpretation of the opinions remains unclear at this stage.  





6







On December 24, 2021, the CSRC released the Administrative Provisions of the State Council Regarding the Overseas Issuance and Listing of Securities by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Comments) (the “Draft Administrative Provisions”) and the Measures for the Overseas Issuance of Securities and Listing Record-Filings by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Comments) (the “Draft Filing Measures,” collectively with the Draft Administrative Provisions, the “Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing”), both of which have a comment period that expired on January 23, 2022. The Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing lay out the filing regulation arrangement for both direct and indirect overseas listing and clarify the determination criteria for indirect overseas listing in overseas markets. Among other things, if an overseas listed issuer intends to implement any follow-on offering in an overseas market, it should, through its major operating entity incorporated in the PRC, submit filing materials to the CSRC within three working days after the completion of the offering. The required filing materials shall include but not be limited to: (1) filing report and relevant commitments; and (2) domestic legal opinions. The Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing, if enacted, may subject us to additional compliance requirements in the future, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to get the clearance of filing procedures under the Draft Rules Regarding Overseas List on a timely basis, or at all. For instance, if we complete any offering after the enactment of the Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing, we may be required to submit additional filings.



As of the date of this annual report, based on advice of counsel in the PRC, no relevant laws or regulations in the PRC explicitly require us, or our operating subsidiaries in the PRC to seek approval from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities for our overseas listing or securities offering plans, nor has our company or any of our subsidiaries, received any inquiry, notice, warning or sanctions regarding any securities offering from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities. However, since these statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government are newly published and official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued, it is highly uncertain what the potential impact such modified or any new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operations, or the ability to accept foreign investments and maintain our listing on a U.S. exchange. The SCNPC or other PRC regulatory authorities may in the future promulgate laws, regulations or implementing rules that require our company or our subsidiaries to obtain regulatory approval from Chinese authorities before offering securities in the U.S.



To the extent we do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals, or inadvertently conclude that such permissions or approvals are not required, the impact on our daily operations may be material and we may be forced to curtail some or all of our operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Doing Business in China - The approval of, or filing or other procedures with, the CSRC or other Chinese regulatory authorities may be required in connection with issuing our equity securities to foreign investors under Chinese law, and, if required, we cannot predict whether we will be able, or how long it will take us, to obtain such approval or complete such filing or other procedures.” 



On November 14, 2021, the CAC released the Draft Cyber Data Security Regulations for public comments, which requires, among others, that a prior cybersecurity review should be required for listing abroad of data processors which process over one million users’ personal information, and the listing of data processors in Hong Kong which affects or may affect national security. See “Item 1A - Risk Factors- Risks Related to Doing Business in China -If we do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive patient, customer and business information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation; We may become subject to cybersecurity review.”

Cash Transfers and Dividend Distributions



We are offshore holding company conducting business through our PRC subsidiaries. In order to fund their operations, we may make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, or we may make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. Such loans to our PRC subsidiaries and capital contributions are subject to PRC regulations and approvals or filing. For example, loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with SAFE or its local branch. Information about capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries must be filed with the PRC Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart. In addition, the PRC government also restricts the convertibility of foreign currencies into Renminbi and use of the proceeds. According to SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16, the flow and use of the Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company is regulated such that Renminbi capital may not be used for business beyond its business scope or to provide loans to persons other than affiliates unless otherwise permitted under its business scope. On October 23, 2019, SAFE promulgated Circular 28, which stipulates that non-investment foreign-funded enterprises are allowed to make domestic equity investment with their capital funds on the premise that the Negative List is not violated and the projects invested thereby in China are true and compliant. Violations of the applicable circulars and rules may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines as set forth in the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. The Circular Regarding Further Optimizing the Cross-border RMB Policy to Support the Stabilization of Foreign Trade and Foreign Investment jointly promulgated by the PBOC, NDRC, the Ministry of Commerce, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and SAFE on December 31, 2020 and effective on February 4, 2021 allows the non-investment foreign-invested enterprises to make domestic reinvestment with RMB capital in accordance with the law on the premise that they comply with prevailing regulations and the invested projects in China are authentic and compliant. In addition, if a foreign-invested enterprise uses RMB income under capital accounts to conduct domestic reinvestment, the invested enterprise is not required to open a special deposit account for RMB capital. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Doing Business in China - PRC regulations on loans and direct investments by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries.”



The applicable foreign exchange circulars and rules may significantly limit our ability to convert, transfer and use the net proceeds from the private placement of convertible notes or any offering of additional equity securities in China, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As the foreign exchange related regulatory regime and practice are complex and still evolving and involve many uncertainties, we cannot assure you that we have complied or will be able to comply with all applicable foreign exchange circulars and rules, or that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or filings on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries or with respect to future capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiaries. If we fail to complete such registrations or filings, our ability to contribute additional capital to fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely and materially affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.



During the normal course of our business, cash is transferred between our subsidiaries via wire transfer to and from bank accounts to pay certain business expenses. Cash is maintained by the parent company BIMI International Medical Inc. in its bank account and transferred to its subsidiaries when necessary. In addition, cash may be used by BIMI as the holding company to meet corporate expenses such as audit fees, attorneys’ fees, stock exchange listing fees, IR/PR expenses and corporate administrative support expenses.



Our Chinese subsidiaries may pay dividends to the parent holding company only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. PRC regulation of loans to, and direct investments in PRC entities by offshore holding companies may delay or prevent us from using proceeds from future financing activities to make loans or additional capital contributions to subsidiaries in the PRC or Hong Kong. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Doing Business in China - PRC regulations on loans and direct investments by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries.”

We have never declared or paid any dividends on our shares or any other securities. If we pay dividends in the future, in order for us to distribute dividends to our shareholders, we will need to rely to some extent on dividends distributed by our PRC subsidiaries. PRC regulations may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, and such distributions will be subject to PRC withholding tax. In addition, PRC regulations currently permit payment of dividends by a PRC company only out of accumulated distributable after-tax profits, as determined in accordance the accounting standards and regulations in the PRC. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Shares - Because we have not paid dividends and have no present intention of paying dividends, investors will not realize any income from an investment in our Common Stock unless and until investors sell their shares at profit.”



If any of our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Under PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries may pay dividends only out of their respective accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a certain statutory reserve fund, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. Such reserve funds cannot be distributed to us as dividends. At its discretion, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to an enterprise expansion fund, or a staff welfare and bonus fund. In addition, registered share capital and capital reserve accounts are also restricted from withdrawal in the PRC, up to the amount of net assets held in each operating subsidiary.



Nevertheless, to the extent cash or assets are located in the PRC or Hong Kong, or in a PRC or Hong Kong entity, the funds or assets may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside the PRC or Hong Kong due to the intervention, or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on our ability or that of our subsidiaries in the PRC or Hong Kong, by the PRC government to transfer cash or assets. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Doing Business in China - PRC regulations on loans and direct investments by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries.



Our PRC subsidiaries generate primarily all of their revenue in RMB, which is not freely convertible into other currencies. As a result, any restriction on currency exchange may limit the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to use their RMB revenues to pay dividends to us. However, conversion of RMB to other currencies are permitted for the purpose of dividends according to the PRC’s regulations on Foreign Exchange Control. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Doing Business in China - Governmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment.



Further, in response to the persistent capital outflow in the PRC and RMB’s depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2016, the People’s Bank of China (“PBOC) and China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) promulgated a series of capital control measures, including stricter vetting procedures for domestic companies to remit foreign currency for overseas investments, dividends payments and shareholder loan repayments. Such measures were relaxed in mid-2017 with the slowdown of the capital outflow and stabilizing of the RMB. However, the PRC government may revert to strengthen its capital controls, and more restrictions and substantial vetting process may be put forward by the SAFE for cross-border transactions falling under both the current account and the capital account. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other kinds of payments to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.



The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”) and its implementation rules provide that China-sourced income of foreign enterprises, such as dividends paid by a PRC subsidiary to its equity holders that are non-PRC resident enterprises, will normally be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of 10%, unless any such foreign investor’s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a reduced withholding rate arrangement and such non-PRC resident enterprises constitute the beneficiary of such income.





9







Pursuant to an arrangement between Mainland China and Hong Kong (the “Hong Kong Tax Treaty”) and relevant tax regulations of the PRC, subject to certain conditions, a reduced withholding tax rate of 5% will be available for dividends from PRC entities provided that the recipient can demonstrate it is a Hong Kong tax resident and it is the beneficial owner of the dividends. The government adopted regulations in 2018 which stipulate that in determining whether a non-resident enterprise has the status as a beneficial owner, comprehensive analysis shall be conducted based on the factors listed therein and the actual circumstances of the specific case shall be taken into consideration. Specifically, it expressly excludes an agent or a designated payee from being considered as a “beneficial owner.”



Cash Management Policies and Procedures 



Under our informal cash management policy, the frequency and amount of intercompany transfers of funds is determined based on the working capital needs of our subsidiaries and intercompany transactions and is subject to internal approval processes and funding arrangements. Our management reviews and monitors our cash flow forecast and working capital needs of our subsidiaries on a regular basis. In addition, capital contributions and intercompany loan arrangements are subject to local jurisdiction and banking regulations. In this regard, we have not faced difficulties or limitations in our ability to transfer cash between subsidiaries in any of our operating jurisdictions.



As December 31, 2021, we have transferred funds to: (i) our operating subsidiaries in the PRC in the amount of $ 4.73 million ; (ii) owners of businesses that we have acquired in the amount of $161 thousand and foreign purchasers of our convertible debt in the amount of $6.5 million in repayment of a portion of the debt incurred. In addition, $ 4.28million has been transferred between our PRC subsidiaries for working capital purposes. The transfer of funds among our operating PRC subsidiaries is subject to the Provisions of the Supreme People’s Court on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in the Trial of Private Lending Cases (2020 Revision, the “Provisions on Private Lending Cases”), which was implemented on August 20, 2020 to regulate the financing activities between natural persons, legal persons and unincorporated organizations. The Provisions on Private Lending Cases does not prohibit using cash generated from one subsidiary to fund another subsidiary’s operations. To date, none of our subsidiaries have made any distributions or paid any dividend to the holding company We have not been notified of any other restriction which could limit our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to transfer cash between subsidiaries. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – pages F–1 and F-12.



Permissions Required from the PRC Authorities for Our Operations 



We conduct our business in China through our subsidiaries. Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. As of the date of this annual report, we have not received any requirement from Chinese governmental authorities to obtain additional permissions for our operation or the issuance of securities to foreign investors. Given the uncertainties of interpretation and implementation of relevant laws and regulations and the enforcement practice by relevant government authorities, we may be required to obtain additional licenses, permits, filings or approvals for the functions and services of our platform in the future.



As of the date of this annual report, based on advice of counsel in the PRC, no relevant laws or regulations in the PRC explicitly require us, or our operating subsidiaries in the PRC to seek approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission ( the “CSRC”) or any other PRC governmental authorities for our overseas listing or securities offering plans, nor has our company or any of our subsidiaries, received any inquiry, notice, warning or sanctions regarding any securities offering from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities. However, since these statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government are newly published and official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued, it is highly uncertain what the potential impact such modified or any new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operations, or the ability to accept foreign investments and maintain our listing on a U.S. exchange. The SCNPC or other PRC regulatory authorities may in the future promulgate laws, regulations or implementing rules that require our company or our subsidiaries to obtain regulatory approval from Chinese authorities before offering securities in the U.S.



However, the PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers. For more detailed information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China— The approval or other requirements of the CSRC or other PRC governmental authorities may be required in connection with an offering of our securities under PRC rules, regulations or policies, and, if required, we cannot predict whether or how soon we will be able to obtain such approval.”

If we or our PRC subsidiaries are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits, approvals or filings, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion to take action in dealing with such violations or failures. In addition, if we had inadvertently concluded that such approvals, permits, registrations or filings were not required, or if applicable laws, regulations or interpretations change in a way that requires us to obtain such approval, permits, registrations or filings in the future, we and our PRC subsidiaries may be unable to obtain such necessary approvals, permits, registrations or filings in a timely manner, or at all, and such approvals, permits, registrations or filings may be rescinded even if obtained. Any such circumstance may subject us to fines and other regulatory, civil or criminal liabilities, and we may be ordered by the competent government authorities to suspend relevant operations, which will materially and adversely affect our business operations.



Furthermore, we may be subject to regular inspections, examinations, inquiries or audits by regulatory authorities, and an adverse outcome of such inspections, examinations, inquiries or audits may result in the loss or nonrenewal of the relevant licenses and approvals. Moreover, the criteria used in reviewing applications for, or renewals of licenses and approvals may change from time to time, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet new criteria that may be imposed to obtain or renew the necessary licenses and approvals. Many of such licenses and approvals are material to the operation of our business, and if we fail to maintain or renew material licenses and approvals, our ability to conduct our business could be materially impaired and we may be forced to curtail some or all of our operations. If the interpretation or implementation of existing laws and regulations change, or new regulations come into effect, requiring us or our PRC subsidiaries to obtain any additional permits, licenses or certificates that were previously not required to operate our business, there can be no assurance that we or our PRC subsidiaries will successfully obtain such permits, licenses or certificates.



Recent History



In January 2019, Mr. Yongquan Bi, a director and a substantial stockholder of the Company, together with a group of investors whose combined holdings constituted a majority of the voting rights in our company, delivered a written consent to the Company’s registered office. The written consent modified the composition of the Board of Directors and Mr. Yongquan Bi was subsequently appointed as the Company’s Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President. In October 2019, Mr. Yongquan Bi resigned from the office of the Chief Executive Officer and President and Mr. Tiewei Song succeeded him as Chief Executive Officer and President. On December 14, 2021, Mr. Yongquan Bi resigned as a director and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company.



The NF Group disposition 



In late 2019, we committed to a plan to dispose of our legacy energy business, NF Investment and its subsidiaries (the “NF Group”), in order to focus on our healthcare business. On March 31, 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell the NF Group for $10 million to be paid in cash at the closing. The transaction closed on June 23, 2020, at which time we received $10 million.

The Boqi Zhengji Acquisition and Subsequent Disposition 



On October 14, 2019, as the initial step in our shift of focus from the energy sector to the healthcare business, we acquired Boqi Zhengji Pharmacy Chain Co., Ltd. (“Boqi Zhengji”), the operator of a pharmacy chain business in the PRC, by purchasing 100% of the equity interests of Lasting Wisdom Holdings Limited (“Lasting”), Boqi Zhengji’ s parent company. Lasting, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Pukung Limited (“Pukung”) and Beijing Xinrongxin Industrial Development Co., Ltd. (“Xinrongxin”), owned all the ownership interests in Boqi Zhengji. The purchase price for Boqi Zhengji consisted of RMB 40 million (approximately $5,655,709) and 300,000 shares of Common Stock. The 300,000 shares of Common Stock were issued to the sellers in October 2019. The cash consideration, which was subject to post-closing adjustments based on the performance of Boqi Zhengji, measured by its pharmacy club member headcount and gross profit in 2020, was not payable until 2021.



Shortly after the acquisition, the business of Boqi Zhengji was severely impacted by the spread of coronavirus, or COVID-19, and its revenues plummeted. On December 11, 2020, we entered into a Termination and Release Agreement (the “Release Agreement”) with the four individuals who sold Boqi Zhengji to us. We and the sellers confirmed that Boqi Zhengji’s performance targets as stipulated in the stock purchase agreement dated April 11, 2019 (as amended on February 6, 2020) would not be met, and therefore the sellers would not be eligible to receive the contingent RMB 40 million cash consideration or any other additional payment.



On December 11, 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell all the issued and outstanding equity interests in Boqi Zhengji to a third-party in consideration of $1,700,000 to be paid in cash at the closing. While the cash consideration was received on December 18, 2020, the official recognition of the closing was not received until February 2, 2021.



Strategy



Our strategy is to build a comprehensive healthcare ecosystem, centering on online and offline healthcare products and services, including retail and wholesale sales of medical devices and pharmaceuticals, and hospital services. We intend to expand through both organic growth and acquisitions.
The Guanzan Acquisition



On February 1, 2020, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire Chongqing Guanzan Technology Co. Ltd. (“Guanzan”), a company engaged in the distribution of medical devices and pharmaceuticals, based in Chongqing, the largest city in Southwest region of the PRC. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to purchase all the issued and outstanding equity interests in Guanzan and its majority owned subsidiary, Chonqing Shude Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, (“Shude”) (together the “Guanzan Group”), for RMB 100,000,000 (approximately $14,285,714) to be paid by the issuance of 190,000 shares of Common Stock and the cash payment of RMB 80,000,000 (approximately $11,428,571). On March 18, 2020, we closed the Guanzan Group acquisition by delivering 190,000 shares of Common Stock. The cash consideration, was subject to post-closing adjustments based on the performance of the Guanzan Group in 2020 and 2021.



The rationale for the Guanzan Group acquisition was to further expand into the healthcare field by acquiring a medical devices and pharmaceuticals distribution business, in line with our expansion strategy which focuses on deeper penetration of the healthcare market in the Southwest region of China and achieving a wider footprint in the PRC. At the time of the acquisition, the Guanzan Group had strong sales capabilities in Chongqing, the largest city in the Southwest region of the PRC.



On November 20, 2020, the parties to the acquisition agreement entered into a Prepayment and Amendment Agreement (the “Prepayment Agreement”) in light of Guanzan’s performance during the period from March 18, 2020 to September 30, 2020, providing for the prepayment of RMB 20,000,000 of the contingent cash consideration in the form of shares of Common Stock. On November 30, 2020, we issued 200,000 shares of Common Stock then valued at $3 million as the prepayment. On August 27, 2021, we issued 920,000 shares of Common Stock in full payment of the balance of the post-closing consideration for the acquisition of the Guanzan Group.

Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to purchase all the issued and outstanding equity interests in Guoyitang for RMB 100,000,000 (approximately $15,325,905) to be paid by the issuance of 400,000 shares of Common Stock and the payment of RMB 60,000,000 (approximately $9,195,543) in cash. The acquisition closed on February 2, 2021, at which time 400,000 shares of Common Stock were delivered to the sellers. The cash consideration of RMB 60,000,000 (approximately $9,195,543) was paid in December 2020. The balance of the purchase price of RMB 40,000,000 (approximately $6,097,560) was subject to post-closing adjustments based on the performance of Guoyitang in 2021 and 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021,there was a performance failure of Guoyitang, accordingly the sellers are not eligible to receive any contingent payments.




13

The transaction closed on February 5, 2021 when 100% ownership of Zhongshan was transferred to our company. The cash consideration of RMB 40,000,000 (approximately $6,116,207) was paid to the seller in December 2020. On February 12, 2021, we issued 400,000 shares of Common Stock then valued at RMB 40,000,000 (approximately $6,116,207) to the seller as part of the consideration. The balance of the purchase price in the amount of RMB 40,000,000 (approximately $6,116,207) was subject to post-closing adjustments based on the performance of Zhongshan in 2021 and 2022.



On February 1, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the agreement providing for the reduction of the purchase price, including a retroactive 50% decrease in the closing cash payment, a 50% retroactive decrease in the deferred closing stock payment and a 50% reduction of the 2021 and 2022 performance targets. As a result of such amendment, the Seller agreed to return RMB 40,000,000 in cash to us in 2022 and 200,000 shares of Common Stock, which were previously delivered to the seller as part of the closing consideration for Zhongshan.

In February 2021, we acquired Guoyitang, the owner and operator of a private general hospital in Chongqing City, a city in Southwest China, with 50 hospital beds and 98 employees, including 14 doctors, 28 nurses, 43 other medical staff and 13 non-medical staff.



In February 2021, we also acquired Zhongshan; a private hospital in the Southeast region of China with 160 hospital beds and 95 employees, including 20 doctors, 48 nurses, 10 other medical staff and 17 non-medical staff.



In May 2021, we acquired the Qiangsheng, Eurasia and Minkang private hospitals in the Southern, Northern and Southwest regions of China, respectively. Qiangsheng has 20 hospital beds and 63 employees, including 18 doctors, 17 nurses, 8 other medical staff and 20 non-medical staff. Eurasia has 12 hospital beds and 52 employees, including 12 doctors, 15 nurses, 7 other medical staff and 18 non-medical staff. Minkang has 126 hospital beds and 116 employees, including 24 doctors, 58 nurses, 12 other medical staff and 22 non-medical staff.



On December 20, 2021, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire Mali Hospital, a private OB-GYN specialty hospital with 199 beds located in Bengbu City in the southeast region of China. Mali Hospital has 148 employees, including 26 doctors, 52 nurses, 11 other medical staff members and 59 non-medical staff members. The closing of the Mali Hospital acquisition is expected to take place in April 2022, subject to necessary regulatory approvals.



Retail Pharmacies 



We started to operate in the pharmacy market upon completion of the acquisition of Boqi Zhengji in October 2019. According to the PRC National Bureau of Statistics, in 2020, the per capita consumption expenditure for pharmaceuticals was RMB 1,843 (approximately $283). After deducting the inflation factor, the actual increase in consumption expenditure doubled the growth rate since 2013. In terms of population structure, the aging population continues to grow. The proportion of people aged 65 and over has increased by 6.45 percentage points since 2019. Affected by factors such as expansion and population migration, the urbanization rate in China is over 60%. We believe such urban population expansion means increased demand for healthcare products. We believe that the increasing demand for pharmaceutical products, the aging of the population, the effect of the new “three-child” policy which should promote an increased demand for pediatric medications, and the steady urbanization, will cause the demand for pharmaceutical products to be stable, providing a solid foundation for growth.

Our retail pharmacy business sells pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products to customers through directly-owned retail stores. The retail stores offer a wide range of products, including prescription and over-the-counter (“OTC”) drugs, nutritional supplements, traditional Chinese medicines, personal and family care products and medical devices, as well as miscellaneous items. In 2020, we sold the Boqi Pharmacy Group and established a chain of retail pharmacies under the brand name “Lijiantang Pharmacy” in the city of Chongqing, PRC. In September 2021,we closed a pharmacy because of poor performance due to road renovations around the pharmacy. By year-end 2021, we had four pharmacies in Chongqing. Each of our pharmacies employs at least one pharmacist, a store manager and several salespersons. Revenues from retail pharmacy for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $316,647 and $84,087 respectively.



The pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers from whom we source our products tend to provide deeper product discounts to companies with both wholesale and retail businesses.



We favor retail locations in well-established residential communities with relatively concentrated consumer purchasing power or are located in close proximity to local hospitals, and evaluate potential store sites to assess consumer traffic, visibility and convenience. Each drugstore has at least one pharmacist on staff, all of whom are properly licensed. The average area of our pharmacy stores is 200 square meters. We only accept prescriptions from licensed health care providers, and verify the validity, accuracy, and completeness of all prescriptions. Most pharmacies also maintain a TCM counter staffed by licensed herbalists. After opening, a location may take up to one year to achieve our projected revenue goals for that particular location Various factors influence individual store revenue including, but not limited to, location, nearby competition, local population demographics, square footage, and government insurance coverage. The first store achieved the expected revenue goal.



At present, we sell prescription drugs, OTC drugs, nutritional supplements, health foods, sundry products and medical devices through our retail pharmacy business. We also distribute medical devices and pharmaceuticals through our wholesale business.



Our retail pharmacy business procures its products from national wholesalers, small regional wholesalers and various pharmaceuticals trading platforms. Our wholesale business primarily sources its products from large state-owned pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers and mid-sized or small private pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers.



Marketing and Promotion



Our current marketing and promotion efforts are focused on our wholesale medical devices, wholesale pharmaceuticals and retail pharmacy operations, and our strategy is to build brand recognition, build strong customer loyalty, and develop incremental revenue opportunities.



For our wholesale business, we promote our products and brand through participation in trade shows and academic seminars and engaging third party professionals in advertisement efforts. We actively pursue direct sales to hospitals, clinics and pharmacies as well government centralized procurement and bidding projects.



In our retail stores, the store managers and staff are encouraged to propose their own advertising and promotional plans, including holiday promotions, posters and billboards. In addition, we periodically offer special discounts and gift promotions for selected merchandise in conjunction with our suppliers’ marketing programs. We intend to invest in advertising in 2022.We also provide ancillary services such as providing free blood pressure readings in our stores.



Many of our promotional programs are designed to encourage manufacturers to invest resources to market their brands within our stores. We charge manufacturers promotional fees in exchange for the right to promote their products during promotional periods. Since manufacturers provide purchasing incentives and information to help customers make informed purchase decisions, we believe that manufacturer led promotions improve our customers’ shopping experience.



Raw Materials and Suppliers



The Company’s medical devices and pharmaceuticals suppliers include national and regional large-scale pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing companies and wholesale pharmaceutical companies.




18







We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we require for our retail and wholesale businesses. As such, we believe that we can change suppliers without any material interruption to our business. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in sourcing our suppliers.



In the year ended December 31, 2021, two vendor accounted for more than 10% of our wholesale medical devices purchases and four vendors accounted for more than 10% of our wholesale pharmaceutical purchases.



Quality Control



We strongly emphasize quality control, which starts with procurement. In addition to their market acceptance and costs, we select products based on Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Supply Practices (“GSP”) compliance by our suppliers. We also assess product quality based on the manufacturer’s facilities and capabilities, including technology, packaging and logistics. We conduct random quality inspections of each batch of products we procure and replace any supplier who fails to pass such inspections.



In addition to general quality control measures described above, we also enforce strict quality control measures at our storage and distribution center. All products for our wholesale and retail businesses are screened upon their arrival, and those with evidence of defects or damages are immediately rejected. Products that pass the screening process are recorded and stored strictly according to each manufacturer’s temperature and other requirements. Products (for both our pharmacies and wholesale customers) are verified against the appropriate delivery orders prior to leaving the facility. We use vehicles with cold-temperature storage to make deliveries as necessary.



Competition 



Guanzan, Shude, Zhuoda and Pusheng, our medical devices and pharmaceuticals distributors, have established distribution channels in the city of Chongqing, China. The wholesale medical devices and pharmaceutical distribution industries in China are competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with regional distributors as well as national operators. These competitors have substantially greater logistics capacities and more financial resources, as well as more industry relevant experience, than us.



The pharmacy industry in China is likewise intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and highly fragmented. We compete on the basis of store location, merchandise selection, prices and brand recognition. Many of our competitors include large, national drugstore chains that may have more financial resources, stronger brand strength, and management expertise than us. Other competitors include local and independent drugstores and government operated pharmacies, as well as discount stores, convenience stores, and supermarkets with respect to sundry and other non-medicinal products that we carry.



We plan to focus on on-line initiated sales in the future based on the use of apps and expect to compete against established state-owned pharmacies and internet giants. No assurance can be given that we will succeed in this initiative.



The medical services market in China is highly competitive and fragmented with numerous market participants. Our competitors include major privately-owned multi-site operators in China. We believe the principal competitive factors in this market are price and quality of service, variety of services rendered, convenience and proximity of treatment center location to place of business or residence, brand recognition and reputation, targeted marketing and customized services. We also face intense competition in our general healthcare service business. We compete primarily with other treatment centers in our areas of operation. Key competitive factors include healthcare service quality, reputation, convenience and price. We expect new competitors in the general healthcare service industry will continue to emerge given the state of China healthcare reform and the central and local governments’ supportive policies towards public healthcare reform and private capital investment in the healthcare services industry.



Research and Development



Currently our research and development efforts by our 10-person research and development group are focused on developing mobile APPs (computer programs or software applications designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone, tablet or watch) for our healthcare service platform. We plan to expand the functionality of the current mobile APP used by our customers. In the future, we plan to devote more resources to research and development and plan to acquire businesses with research and development capabilities.

Regulatory Compliance 



This section sets forth a summary of the most significant rules and regulations that affect our business activities in China.



Regulations on Foreign Investment 



The Foreign Investment Law of the PRC (“Foreign Investment Law”) was formally adopted by the National People’s Congress on March 15, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. The Foreign Investment Law is formulated to further expand opening-up, vigorously promote foreign investment and protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors. According to the Foreign Investment Law, foreign investments are entitled to pre-entry national treatment and are subject to negative list management system. The pre-entry national treatment means that the treatment given to foreign investors and their investments at the stage of investment access is not lower than that of domestic investors and their investments. The negative list management system means that the state implements special administrative procedures for access of foreign investment in specific fields. Foreign investors shall not invest in any forbidden fields stipulated in the negative list and shall meet the conditions stipulated in the negative list before investing in any restricted fields.



Foreign investors’ investment, earnings and other legitimate rights and interests within the territory of China are protected in accordance with the law, and all national policies on supporting the development of enterprises shall equally apply to foreign-invested enterprises. The state guarantees that foreign-invested enterprises participate in the formulation of standards in an equal manner. The state guarantees that foreign-invested enterprises participate in government procurement activities through fair competition in accordance with the law. The State shall not expropriate any foreign investment except under special circumstances. In special circumstances, the state may levy or expropriate the investment of foreign investors in accordance with the law for the needs of the public interest. The expropriation and requisition shall be conducted in accordance with legal procedures and timely and reasonable compensation shall be given. In carrying out business activities, foreign-invested enterprises shall comply with relevant provisions on labor protection, social insurance, tax, accounting, foreign exchange and other matters stipulated in laws and regulations.



On December 19, 2020, the NDRC and the MOFCOM jointly promulgated the Measures on the Security Review of Foreign Investment, effective on January 18, 2021, which sets forth provisions concerning the security review mechanism on foreign investment, including the types of investments subject to review, review scopes and procedures, among others. The Office of the Working Mechanism of the Security Review of Foreign Investment (the “Office of the Working Mechanism”) will be established under the NDRC to carry out routine work of security review on foreign investment. Foreign investor or relevant parties in China must declare the security review to the Office of the Working Mechanism prior to (i) the investments in the military industry, military industrial supporting industry and other fields relating to the security of national defense, and investments in areas surrounding military facilities and military industry facilities; and (ii) investments in important agricultural products, important energy and resources, important equipment manufacturing, important infrastructure, important transport services, important cultural products and services, important information technology and internet products and services, important financial services, key technologies and other important fields relating to national security, and obtain control in the target enterprise. Control exists when the foreign investor (i) holds over 50% equity interests in the target, (ii) has voting rights that can materially impact on the resolutions of the board of directors or shareholders meeting of the target even when it holds less than 50% equity interests in the target, or (iii) has material impact on the target’s business decisions, human resources, accounting and technology, etc.



On December 26, 2019, the State Council promulgated the Implementation Regulations on the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, and it further requires that foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises shall be treated equally with respect to policy making and implementation. Pursuant to the Implementation Regulations on the Foreign Investment Law, if the existing foreign-invested enterprises fail to change their original forms as of January 1, 2025, the relevant market regulation departments will not process other registration matters for the enterprises, and may disclose their relevant information to the public.





20







On December 30, 2019, the MOFCOM and the State Administration for Market Regulation jointly issued the Measures for Reporting of Foreign Investment Information, or the Foreign Investment Information Measures, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced the Interim Administrative Measures for the Record-filing of the Establishment and Modification of Foreign-invested Enterprises. Since January 1, 2020, for foreign investors carrying out investment activities directly or indirectly in the PRC, foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises shall submit investment information through the Enterprise Registration System and the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System operated by the State Administration for Market Regulation. Foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises shall disclose their investment information by submitting reports for their establishments, modifications and cancelations and their annual reports in accordance with the Foreign Investment Information Measures. If a foreign-invested enterprise investing in the PRC has finished submitting its reports for its establishment, modifications and cancelation and its annual reports, the relevant information will be shared by the competent market regulation department to the competent commercial department, and does not require such foreign-invested enterprise to submit the reports separately.



Regulations on Annual Inspection.



In accordance with relevant PRC laws, all types of enterprises incorporated under PRC laws are required to conduct annual inspections with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce of the PRC or its local branches. In addition, foreign invested enterprises are subject to annual inspections conducted by other applicable PRC governmental authorities. In order to reduce enterprises’ burden of submitting inspection documentation to different governmental authorities, the Measures on Implementing Joint Annual Inspection on Foreign-invested Enterprises issued in 1998 by State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”), together with six other ministries, stipulated that foreign-invested enterprises must participate in an annual inspection jointly conducted by all relevant PRC governmental authorities.
Regulations on Foreign Currency Exchange.



Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and amended in 2008 and various regulations issued by the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) and the SAFE and other relevant PRC governmental authorities, Renminbi are freely convertible only to the extent of current account items, such as trade related receipts and payments, interest and dividends. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, require prior approval from SAFE or its local counterpart for conversion of Renminbi into a foreign currency, such as US dollars, and remittance of the foreign currency outside the PRC.



Payments for transactions that take place within the PRC must be made in Renminbi. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies must repatriate foreign currency payments received from abroad. Foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks subject to a cap set by SAFE or its local counterpart. Unless otherwise approved, domestic enterprises must convert all of their foreign currency receipts into Renminbi. On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated a circular regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested company of its registered capital in foreign currency into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. This circular stipulates that the registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within China. Violations of this circular can result in severe penalties, including monetary fines.



In addition, any foreign loans to an operating subsidiary in China that is a foreign invested enterprise, cannot, in the aggregate, exceed the difference between its approved total investment amount and its approved “registered capital amount”.



Regulation of Foreign Exchange in Certain Onshore and Offshore Transactions.



 In October 2005, SAFE issued Circular 75, which regulates foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of a “special purpose vehicle” by PRC residents to seek offshore equity financing and conduct “return investment” in China. Under Circular 75, a “special purpose vehicle” refers to an offshore entity established or controlled, directly or indirectly, by PRC citizens or PRC entities (collectively, as PRC residents) for the purpose of seeking offshore equity financing using assets or interests owned by such PRC residents or PRC entities in onshore companies, while “round trip investment” refers to the direct investment in China by PRC residents through the use of “special purpose vehicles,” including without limitation, establishing foreign invested enterprises and using such foreign invested enterprises to purchase or control (by way of contractual arrangements) onshore assets. Circular 75 requires that, before establishing or controlling a “special purpose vehicle,” PRC residents are required to complete foreign exchange registration with the competent local counterparts of SAFE for their overseas investments. In addition, such PRC resident is required to amend his or her SAFE registration or to file with SAFE or its competent local branch, with respect to that offshore special purpose vehicle in connection with any increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, merger, division, equity investment or creation of any security interest over any assets located in China by the offshore special purpose vehicle. To further clarify the implementation of such amendment or filing procedure, SAFE requires domestic enterprises under Circular 75 to coordinate and supervise such amendment or filings with SAFE or its local counterparts by such PRC residents. If PRC residents fail to comply, the domestic enterprises are required to report to the local SAFE authorities.



Failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in Circular 75 may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including being prohibited from distributing its profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to its offshore parent or affiliate, and restrictions on the ability to contribute additional capital from the offshore entity to the PRC entities, and may also subject relevant PRC residents to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations.




21







Regulation of Overseas Listings.



On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the CSRC and MOFCOM jointly promulgated the “Rules on the Mergers and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors,” which became effective on September 8, 2006, and was further amended on June 22, 2009, or the M&A Rules. Among other things, the M&A Rules include provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle, or SPV, formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals must obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such SPV’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by SPVs seeking CSRC approval of their overseas listings. However, the application of this PRC regulation remains unclear with no consensus currently existing among the leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement to various types of transactions, including those which involve the use of variable interest entity agreements.



In addition, according to the Notice on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors issued by the General Office of the State Council on February 3, 2011 and which became effective on March 4, 2011, the Rules on Implementation of Security Review System for the Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors issued by the MOFCOM on August 25, 2011 and which became effective on September 1, 2011, mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise “national defense and security” concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise “national security” concerns are subject to strict review by the MOFCOM, and the regulations prohibit any activities attempting to bypass such security review, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement.



On December 24, 2021, the CSRC issued the Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments), or the Draft Overseas Listing Administration Provisions, and the Administrative Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments), or the Draft Overseas Listing Filing Measures, which are open for public comments until January 23, 2022.



The Draft Overseas Listing Administration Provisions, if adopted in its current form, will comprehensively improve and reform the existing regulatory regime for overseas offering and listing of PRC domestic companies’ securities, and will regulate both direct and indirect overseas offering and listing of PRC domestic companies’ securities by adopting a filing-based regulatory regime. According to the draft regulations, PRC domestic companies that seek to offer and list securities in overseas markets, either in direct or indirect means, are required to fulfill the filing procedure with the CSRC and report relevant information. Overseas offerings and listings that are prohibited by specific laws and regulations, constitute threat to or endanger national security, involve material ownership disputes, the PRC domestic companies, their controlling shareholder or actual controller involving in certain criminal offence, or directors, supervisors and senior management of the issuer involving in certain criminal offence or administrative penalties, among other circumstances, are explicitly forbidden. As implementation rules, the Draft Overseas Listing Filing Measures specifies the filing requirement and procedures. The Draft Overseas Listing Filing Measures provides that if the issuer meets the following criteria, the overseas securities offering and listing conducted by such issuer will be deemed as indirect overseas offering by PRC domestic companies: (i) any of the revenue, net profit, total assets or net assets of the domestic companies accounted for more than 50% of the respective audited revenue, net profit, total assets or net assets of the issuer within the latest fiscal year; (ii) a majority of the officers responsible for management of the issuer are PRC citizens or have their usual place of residence located in mainland China, the issuer’s main place of operation is within mainland China. It is unclear based on the Draft Overseas Listing Filing Measures whether either or both of the above criteria need to be satisfied. Where an issuer makes an application for initial public offering to competent overseas regulators, the issuer must submit to the CSRC filing documents within three working days after such application is submitted. The Draft Overseas Listing Filing Measures also requires subsequent report to the CSRC on material events, such as material change in principal business and change of control.



As of the date of this annual report, the Draft Overseas Listing Administration Provisions and the Draft Overseas Listing Filing Measures were released for public comments only and the final version and effective date of such regulations are subject to change with substantial uncertainty.



Regulations on Anti-Monopoly 



The Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress which became effective on August 1, 2008 and the Interim Provisions on the Review of Concentrations of Undertakings promulgated by the SAMR which became effective on December 1, 2020 require that transactions which are deemed concentrations and involve parties with specified turnover thresholds must be cleared by the SAMR before they can be completed. Where the participation in concentration of undertakings by way of foreign-funded merger and acquisition of domestic enterprises or any other method which involves national security, the examination of concentration of undertakings shall be carried out pursuant to the provisions of this law and examination of national security shall be carried out pursuant to the relevant provisions of the state. Failure to comply with above regulations may result in an order to stop concentration, dispose the shares/assets or transfer the operation within a stipulated period, or adopt other necessary measures to reinstate the preconcentration status, or fines.





22







On October 23, 2021, the SCNPC issued a draft of the amended Anti-Monopoly Law for public comments. On June 24, 2022, the Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Revising the Anti-monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China, or the Revised Anti-monopoly Law was released, which will be effective on August 1, 2022. According to the Revised Anti-monopoly Law, the fines for illegal concentration of business operators have been increased to no more than ten percent of its last year’s sales revenue if the concentration of business operator has or may have an effect of excluding or limiting competitions; or a fine of up to RMB5 million if the concentration of business operator does not have an effect of excluding or limiting competition. The Revised Anti-monopoly Law also stipulates that the relevant authority shall investigate a transaction where there is any evidence that the concentration has or may have the effect of eliminating or restricting competitions, even if such concentration does not reach the filing threshold. And in order to adapt the Revised Anti-monopoly Law, on June 27, 2022, the SAMR issued a Discussion Draft of the Provisions on Prohibition of the Abuse of Market Dominance. As of the date of this annual report, the Discussion Draft of the Provisions on Prohibition of the Abuse of Market Dominance was released for public comments only and the final version and effective date of such regulations are subject to substantial uncertainty.



Regulations of Dividend Distribution. 



Under current applicable laws and regulations, each of our consolidated PRC entities may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our consolidated PRC entities is required to deposit at least ten percent (10%) of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year into its statutory surplus reserve fund until the accumulative amount of such reserve reaches fifty percent (50%) of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.
Regulations Relating to Taxation.



The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law applies a 25% enterprise income tax rate to both foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises, except to the extent tax incentives are granted to special industries and projects. Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation regulations, dividends generated from the business of a PRC subsidiary after January 1, 2008 and payable to its foreign investor may be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10% if the PRC tax authorities determine that the foreign investor is a non-resident enterprise, unless there is a tax treaty with China that provides for a preferential withholding tax rate. Distributions of earnings generated before January 1, 2008 are exempt from PRC withholding tax.



Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, an enterprise established outside China with “de facto management bodies” within China is considered a “resident enterprise” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and is generally subject to a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide income. A circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation in April 2009 regarding the standards used to classify certain Chinese-invested enterprises controlled by Chinese enterprises or Chinese enterprise groups and established outside of China as “resident enterprises” clarified that dividends and other income paid by such PRC “resident enterprises” will be considered PRC-source income and subject to PRC withholding tax, currently at a rate of 10%, when paid to non-PRC enterprise shareholders. This circular also subjects such PRC “resident enterprises” to various reporting requirements with the PRC tax authorities.



Under the implementation regulations to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, a “de facto management body” is defined as a body that has material and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and properties of an enterprise. In addition, the tax circular mentioned above specifies that certain PRC invested overseas enterprises controlled by a Chinese enterprise or a Chinese enterprise group in the PRC will be classified as PRC resident enterprises if the following are located or resident in the PRC: senior management personnel and departments that are responsible for daily production, operation and management; financial and personnel decision making bodies; key properties, accounting books, the company seal, and minutes of board meetings and shareholders’ meetings; and 50% or more of the senior management or directors having voting rights.



Pharmaceutical and Ancillary Regulation



According to the “Administrative Measures for Pharmaceutical Business Licenses” and other relevant regulations in China, we need to obtain qualification certificates the operations of our Company, including all of our subsidiaries and pharmacy stores in China. The qualification certificates mainly include the “Quality Management Certificate for Pharmaceutical Administration” (GSP Certificate) and the “Pharmaceutical Business License”. “Food Business License”, “Medical Device Business License”, “Medical Agency Practice License”, etc.



All of our pharmacies have obtained Pharmaceutical Business Licenses and Pharmaceutical Management Quality Management Certificates In addition, all of our pharmacies have obtained Internet Drug Information Service Qualification Certificates and Medical Device Network Sales Records These business qualifications, which are necessary for operating pharmacies in China, are subject to annual renewal.




23







A distributor of pharmaceutical products must obtain a distribution permit from the relevant provincial or designated municipal or county level Food and Drug Administration. The grant of such permit is subject to an inspection of the distributor’s facilities, warehouses, hygienic environment, quality control systems, personnel, and equipment. The distribution permit is valid for five (5) years, and the holder must apply for renewal of the permit within six (6) months prior to its expiration. In addition, a pharmaceutical product distributor needs to obtain a business license from the relevant administration for industry and commerce prior to commencing its business. All of our retail pharmacies s have obtained necessary pharmaceutical distribution permits, and we do not expect to face any difficulties in renewing these permits and/or certifications.



In addition, under the Supervision and Administration Rules on Pharmaceutical Product Distribution, promulgated by the SFDA, a pharmaceutical product distributor is responsible for its procurement and sales activities and is liable for the actions of its employees or agents in connection with their conduct of distribution on behalf of the distributor. A retail distributor of pharmaceutical products is not allowed to sell prescription pharmaceutical products or Tier A OTC pharmaceutical products listed in the national or provincial medical insurance catalogs without a valid prescription or the presence of a certified in-store pharmacist. See “Reimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program.”



A distributor of nutritional supplements and other food products must obtain a food circulation permit from its local Administration of Industry and Commerce. The grant of such permit is subject to an inspection of the distributor’s facilities, warehouses, hygienic environment, quality control systems, personnel, and equipment. The food circulation permit is valid for three (3) years, and the holder must apply for renewal of the certificate within thirty (30) days prior to its expiration. The Guanzan Group has received this permit for its operation.



GSP standards regulate wholesale and retail pharmaceutical product distributors to ensure the quality of distribution of pharmaceutical products in China. All wholesale and retail pharmaceutical product distributors are required to apply for GSP certification within thirty (30) days after obtaining drug distribution permits. The current applicable GSP standards require pharmaceutical product distributors to implement strict controls on the distribution of pharmaceutical products, including standards regarding staff qualifications, distribution premises, warehouses, inspection equipment and facilities, management, and quality control. Specifically, the warehouse must be able to store the pharmaceutical products at various required temperatures and humidity, and handle transport, warehouse entries, delivery, and billing by computerized logistics management systems. The GSP certificate is usually valid for five (5) years. Currently, Guanzan Group is a GSP certified company.



Under the Rules on Administration of Prescriptions promulgated by the SFDA, doctors are required to include the chemical ingredients of the medicine they prescribe in their prescription and are not allowed to include brand names in their prescription. This regulation is designed to provide consumers with choices among different pharmaceutical products that contain the same chemical ingredients.



Eligible participants in the national medical insurance program, consisting primarily of urban residents, are entitled to purchase medicine when presenting their medical insurance cards in an authorized pharmacy, provided that the medicine they purchase has been included in the national or provincial medical insurance catalogs. Depending on relevant local regulations, authorized pharmacies can either (i) sell medicine on credit and obtain reimbursement from relevant government social security bureaus on a monthly basis, or (ii) receive payments from the participants at the time of their purchases, and the participants in turn obtain reimbursement from relevant government social security bureaus.



Medications included in the national and provincial medical insurance catalogs are divided into two (2) tiers. Purchases of Tier A pharmaceutical products are generally fully reimbursable. Purchasers of Tier B pharmaceutical products, which are generally more expensive than those in Tier A, are required to make a certain percentage of co-payments, with the remaining amount being reimbursable. The percentage of reimbursement for Tier B OTC products varies in different regions in the PRC. Factors that affect the inclusion of medicine in the medical insurance catalogs include whether the medicine is consumed in large volumes and commonly prescribed for clinical use in China and whether it is considered to be important in meeting the basic healthcare needs of the general public.



China’s Ministry of Labor and Social Security, together with other government authorities, have the power to determine which medicines are included in the national medical insurance catalog every two (2) years, under which of the two (2) tiers the included medicine falls, and whether an included medicine should be removed from the catalog.




24







Advertising Regulation



Under the Advertising Law of the PRC, the contents of an advertisement must be true, lawful, without falsehood, and must neither deceive nor mislead consumers. Accordingly, advertisements must be examined by the competent authority prior to its publication or broadcast through any form of media. In addition, advertisements of pharmaceutical products may only be based on a drug’s approved indication of use statement, and may not contain any assurance of a product’s efficiency, treatment efficiency, curative rate, or any other information prohibited by law. Advertisement for certain drugs should include an admonishment to seek a doctor’s advice before purchasing and application. Advertising is prohibited for certain drugs such as anesthetics and psychotropic drugs.



To further prevent misleading advertising of pharmaceutical products, the SAIC and the SFDA jointly promulgated the Standards for Examination and Publication of Advertisements of Pharmaceutical Products and Measures for Examination of Advertisement of Pharmaceutical Products in March 2007. Under these regulations, an approval must be obtained from the provincial level of food and drug administration before a pharmaceutical product may be advertised. In addition, once approved, an advertisement’s content may not be altered without further approval. Such approval, once obtained, is valid for one (1) year.



Regulation of Medical Institutions



We started to operate in and have been subject to regulations relating to the management of medical institutions upon completion of the acquisition of Guoyitang in January 2021.
