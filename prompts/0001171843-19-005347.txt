ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated under the BCBCA with the name “Corvus Gold Inc.” on April 13, 2010 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ITH, with an authorized capital consisting of an unlimited number of Common Shares. Pursuant to the corporate spin-out of Corvus from ITH by way of a plan of arrangement among ITH, the shareholders of ITH and Corvus under the BCBCA, effective August 26, 2010, Corvus was spun out as a separate and independent public company, and each shareholder of ITH received one-half of a Common Share.
 
We are a reporting issuer in the Canadian Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario and the Common Shares are listed for trading on the TSX under the trading symbol “KOR” and are quoted for trading on the OTCQX under the symbol “CORVF”.
 
Our head office is located at Suite 1750 – 700 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 1G8, and our registered and records office is located at Suite 2200, HSBC Building, 885 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 3E8.
 
We are a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. We currently hold or have the right to acquire interests in the NBP and the MLP in Nevada. We are in the exploration stage as our Properties have not yet reached commercial production and our Properties are not beyond the preliminary exploration stage. All work presently planned by us is directed at defining mineralization and increasing understanding of the characteristics of, and economics of, that mineralization.

Recent Corporate History
 
In May 2010, the board of directors of ITH approved a proposal to undertake a spin-out transaction to segregate its then existing assets into two separate and highly focused companies.
 
The spin-out transaction pursuant to the Arrangement was approved by the shareholders of ITH on August 12, 2010, and the final order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia approving the plan of arrangement necessary to implement the transaction was received on August 20, 2010. The effective date of the Arrangement was August 26, 2010 and the Common Shares commenced trading on the TSX on August 30, 2010. Under the terms of the Arrangement, ITH retained all assets relating to the Livengood gold project in Alaska, together with approximately $33 million in working capital, while Corvus received all of ITH’s other existing Alaska and Nevada assets (including the shares of Corvus Nevada), together with approximately $3.3 million in working capital.
 
Following the completion of the Arrangement, Corvus held four advanced to early stage exploration projects in Alaska (Chisna, Terra, LMS and West Pogo) and the advanced exploration stage NBP in Nevada. Our primary focus is to leverage our exploration expertise to discover major new gold deposits. Furthermore, we intend to try and build ourselves into a non-operator gold producer with significant carried interests and royalty exposure. To meet this objective, all of the Alaskan projects received by us in the Arrangement have been sold.
 
We also received from ITH a 100% interest in the NBP, which is Corvus’ sole material mineral property and the primary focus of our exploration activities. Since the acquisition of the NBP from ITH, we have expanded the NBP by entering into additional leases of patented lode mining claims and staking additional unpatented lode mining claims.
 
In June 2017, Corvus acquired 100% of the MLP from Goldcorp USA, Inc. and staked two additional claim blocks adjacent to the MLP. The MLP is in close proximity to Corvus Gold’s NBP with potential for integration into a single operation.

Business Operations
 
Summary 
 
We currently hold, or have rights to acquire, interests in two mineral properties in Nevada, USA, the NBP and the MLP. The Company’s objectives with respect to these Properties are to evaluate the potential of the Properties and to determine if spending additional funds is warranted (in which case, an appropriate program to advance the Properties to the next decision point will be formulated and, depending upon available funds, implemented by us) or not (in which case the Properties may be returned by us to the optionor/lessor or, in respect of properties in which we are earning an interest, be returned to the optionor thereof). Our present focus is on the exploration and, if warranted, development of the NBP, located 15 kilometres north of Beatty, Nevada, and the MLP, located in the Bare Mountain District, approximately 10 kilometres from the NBP. Corvus also staked two additional claim blocks, the MN claim group, to the northwest of the Mother Lode claims, and the ME claim group, to the east of the Mother Lode claims, and the GAP claim group, immediately to the south of NBP. The progress on, and results of, the work programs on our material mineral property is set out under Part I, Item 2, Properties in this Annual Report. We continue to assess additional mineral property acquisitions but do not presently contemplate entering into any such agreements, other than in connection with the NBP and the MLP.
 
We are in the exploration stage and do not mine, produce or sell any mineral products at this time. With respect to the NBP and MLP, our present preliminary studies indicate that any production would be through a combination of heap leaching some of the mineralization (and treatment of the leaching solution to recover gold and silver) and processing higher grade mineralization through a plant incorporating both a gravity concentration-cyanide leach circuit and a concentration circuit followed by pressure oxidation of the concentrate and then leaching of the oxidized filtrate.
 
Exploration drilling has been focused on the MLP with Phase I beginning at the MLP in September 2017. Phase II exploration drilling at MLP began in January 2018 and was completed July 2018. Phase I and Phase II drilling results were used to develop a maiden Mineral Resource estimate for the MLP which was reported in September 2018 (NR 18-15). Exploration drilling continued at MLP, Phase III, until April 2019, at which time the drilling rig was moved to NBP.
 
Availability of Raw Materials
 
All of the raw materials we require to carry on our business are readily available through normal supply or business contracting channels in Canada and the United States. Since commencing current operations in August 2010, we have been able to secure the appropriate personnel, equipment and supplies required to conduct our contemplated programs. As a result, we do not believe that we will experience any shortages of required personnel, equipment or supplies in the foreseeable future.
 
Dependence on a Few Contracts
 
Our business is not substantially dependent on any contract such as a contract to sell the major part of the Company’s products or services or to purchase the major part of its requirements for goods, services or raw materials, or on any franchise or license or other agreement to use a patent, formula, trade secret, process or trade name upon which its business depends. Rather, our ability to continue making the holding, assessment, lease and option payments necessary to maintain our interest in our mineral projects is of primary concern. We do not presently anticipate any difficulties in this regard in the current financial year.
 
Competitive Conditions 
 
There is aggressive competition within the minerals industry to discover and acquire mineral properties considered to have commercial potential. We compete with other entities for the opportunity to participate in exploration projects which we believe are promising. In addition, we compete with others in efforts to obtain financing to acquire and explore mineral properties, acquire and utilize mineral exploration equipment and hire qualified mineral exploration personnel. We may compete with other junior mining companies for mining claims in regions adjacent to our existing claims, or in other parts of the world should we dedicate resources to doing so in the future. These companies may be better capitalized than us and we may have difficulty in expanding our holdings through the staking or acquisition of additional mining claims or other mineral tenures.
 
In competing for qualified mineral exploration personnel, we may be required to pay compensation or benefits relatively higher than those paid in the past, and the availability of qualified personnel may be limited in high-demand mining periods, such as was in past years when the price of gold was higher than it is now.

Government Regulation
 
The exploration and development of a mining prospect is subject to regulation by a number of federal and state government authorities. These include the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the United States Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) as well as the various state environmental protection agencies. The regulations address many environmental issues relating to air, soil and water contamination and apply to many mining related activities including exploration, mine construction, mineral extraction, ore milling, water use, waste disposal and use of toxic substances. In addition, we are subject to regulations relating to labor standards, occupational health and safety, mine safety, general land use, export of minerals and taxation. Many of the regulations require permits or licenses to be obtained and the filing of Notices of Intent and Plans of Operations, the absence of which or inability to obtain will adversely affect the ability for us to conduct our exploration, development and operation activities. The failure to comply with the regulations and terms of permits and licenses may result in fines or other penalties or in revocation of a permit or license or loss of a prospect.
Federal
 
On lands owned by the United States, mining rights are governed by the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended, which allows the location of mining claims on certain federal lands upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and compliance with location requirements. The exploration of mining properties and development and operation of mines is governed by both federal and state laws. Federal laws that govern mining claim location and maintenance and mining operations on federal lands are generally administered by the BLM. Additional federal laws, governing mine safety and health, also apply. State laws also require various permits and approvals before exploration, development or production operations can begin. Among other things, a reclamation plan must typically be prepared and approved, with bonding in the amount of projected reclamation costs. The bond is used to ensure that proper reclamation takes place, and the bond will not be released until that time. Local jurisdictions may also impose permitting requirements (such as conditional use permits or zoning approvals).
Nevada
 
In Nevada, initial stage surface exploration activities that do not disturb the surface, do not require any permits. Notice-level exploration permits (“NOI”) are required (through the BLM) for the NBP and MLP to perform drilling or other surface disturbing activites with less than five acres extent. More extensive disturbance requires submittal and approval of a “Plan of Operations” and “Environmental Assessment” from the BLM. In May 2013, Corvus obtained an amended Plan of Operations allowing 100 acres of surface disturbance in the public lands portion of the NBP, which is considered sufficient by us for our currently planned drilling and characterization program. Reclamation costs have been re-estimated on a 3-year basis, with the most recent submitted June 19, 2019. We also applied for, and received in August 2013, a NOI for disturbance of an additional 1.3 acres outside the currently defined NBP area in order to allow us to drill water monitor wells and perform geotechnical soil investigations outside the NBP area. This NOI has been reviewed and extended until May 9, 2021 by BLM. In June of 2015, the Company applied for, and received a NOI which allowed an additional 2.1 acres of disturbance for exploration of the Eastern Steam-heated Alteration zone, outside of the NBP permit area. On December 7, 2015, a decision allowing the increase in disturbance area to 4.8 acres in the Eastern Steam-heated Alteration zone was received from BLM. This Notice has been extended to 2021. In August of 2017, the Company received an NOI from BLM which allowed 4.8 acres of surface disturbance for drilling exploration at the MLP. In June 2018, Corvus received approval of an NOI for 4.4 acres of disturbance at the Company’s Willy’s Exploration Project near the MLP. In September 2018, Corvus received approval of an NOI for 0.7 acres of disturbance at the Company’s Sawtooth Project site near the MLP. As of May 24, 2019, the Company had posted with the BLM, as security for the reclamation obligations, a Surety Bond of USD 411,191. In general, exploration activities in Nevada can be carried out on a year-round basis. Mining is conducted in Nevada on a year round basis, both open pit and underground.
 
In Nevada, we are also required to post bonds with the State of Nevada to secure our environmental and reclamation obligations on private land, with amount of such bonds reflecting the level of rehabilitation anticipated by the then proposed activities. Currently, the Company has posted with Nevada Division of Minerals BMRR in the State of Nevada, as security for these reclamation obligations, a Surety Bond of USD 209,070.
 
In June 2013, formal meetings were held with officials of both the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (“NDEP”) and the BLM to discuss the design criteria for the environmental baseline studies that will be required to support the development of a Plan of Operation and other permit applications necessary to enable any mining at or production from the NBP. In January 2014, Corvus Nevada executed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with the Tonopah Office of the BLM for definition of baseline characterization requirements and development of a mining plan of operations at the NBP. Characterization plans for hydro-geologic modeling studies, rock geochemical studies and biologic/wildlife studies have been developed and have been reviewed by BLM specialists. We are in the process of responding to comments and additional requirements received from the BLM with respect to such plans.

In July 2019, the Company submitted revised Environmental Assessment (“EA”) and Exploration Plan of Operations (“PoO”) documents for 145 acres of surface disturbance required for an expanded drilling and exploration program at the MLP. That application is pending approval of the BLM.
 
If we are successful in the future at discovering a commercially viable mineral deposit on our property interests, then if and when we commence any mineral production, we will also need to comply with laws that regulate or propose to regulate our mining activities, including the management and handling of raw materials, disposal, storage and management of hazardous and solid waste, the safety of our employees and post-mining land reclamation.
 
We cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws, regulations or permitting requirements, or changes in the ways that such laws, regulations or permitting requirements are enforced, interpreted or administered. Health, safety and environmental laws and regulations are complex, are subject to change and have become more stringent over time. It is possible that greater than anticipated health, safety and environmental capital expenditures or reclamation and closure expenditures will be required in the future. We expect continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future investments for environmental controls at our operations.
 
Environmental Regulation 
 
Our mineral projects are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. The development, operation, closure, and reclamation of mining projects in the United States requires numerous notifications, permits, authorizations, and public agency decisions. Compliance with environmental and related laws and regulations requires us to obtain permits issued by regulatory agencies, and to file various reports and keep records of our operations. Certain of these permits require periodic renewal or review of their conditions and may be subject to a public review process during which opposition to our proposed operations may be encountered. We are currently operating under various permits for activities connected to mineral exploration, reclamation, and environmental considerations. Our policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
 
Changes to current local, state or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.
 
U.S. Federal Laws 
 
The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and comparable state statutes, impose strict, joint and several liability on current and former owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the government to file claims requiring cleanup actions, demands for reimbursement for government-incurred cleanup costs, or natural resource damages, or for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance, as well as requirements for corrective actions. CERCLA, RCRA and comparable state statutes can impose liability for clean-up of sites and disposal of substances found on exploration, mining and processing sites long after activities on such sites have been completed.
 
The Clean Air Act (“CAA”), as amended, restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including mining and processing activities. Any future mining operations by the Company may produce air emissions, including fugitive dust and other air pollutants from stationary equipment, storage facilities and the use of mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment, which are subject to review, monitoring and/or control requirements under the CAA and state air quality laws. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. In addition, permitting rules may impose limitations on our production levels or result in additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the rules.
 
The National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) requires federal agencies to integrate environmental considerations into their decision-making processes by evaluating the environmental impacts of their proposed actions, including issuance of permits to mining facilities, and assessing alternatives to those actions. If a proposed action could significantly affect the environment, the agency must prepare a detailed statement known as an Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), other federal agencies, and any interested third parties will review and comment on the scoping of the EIS and the adequacy of and findings set forth in the draft and final EIS. This process can cause delays in issuance of required permits or result in changes to a project to mitigate its potential environmental impacts, which can in turn impact the economic feasibility of a proposed project.

The Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and comparable state statutes, impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA regulates storm water mining facilities and requires a storm water discharge permit for certain activities. Such a permit requires the regulated facility to monitor and sample storm water run-off from its operations. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release.
 
The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program promulgated thereunder, regulate the drilling and operation of subsurface injection wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states and in others the responsibility for the program has been delegated to the state. The program requires that a permit be obtained before drilling a disposal or injection well. Violation of these regulations and/or contamination of groundwater by mining related activities may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SWDA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.
 
 Nevada
 
Other Nevada regulations govern operating and design standards for the construction and operation of any source of air contamination and landfill operations. Any changes to these laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and results of operations by, for example, requiring changes to operating constraints, technical criteria, fees or surety requirements.
Key Personnel
 
As at August 8, 2019, we have two full time employees and six part-time consultants. Our operations are managed by our officers with oversight by the Directors. We engage geological, metallurgical, and engineering consultants from time to time as required to assist in evaluating our property interests and recommending and conducting work programs.
Gold Price History
 
The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global and regional gold demand and the political and economic conditions.
 
The following table presents the high, low and average afternoon fixed prices in U.S. dollars for an ounce of gold on the London Bullion Market over the past five calendar years and the current calendar year to date:
 

Year | High | | Low | Average
------------------------------+------+-------+-----+--------
 | USD | | USD | USD 
2014 | | 1,385 | | | 1,142 | 1,267
