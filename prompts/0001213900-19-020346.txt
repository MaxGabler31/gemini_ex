ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Business Overview
 
Global Seed Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Texas on July 13, 2010. We had been engaged principally in the distribution of a monthly journal prior to our change in control consummated on June 2, 2018.
 
On May 21, 2018, Leung Kwok Hei, Chi Siu On, Leung Siu Hung and Chan Hiu (collectively, the “Purchasers”) and various shareholders (the “Sellers”) of the Company entered into a share purchase agreement, pursuant which the Sellers transferred to the Purchasers an aggregate of 4,492,000 shares of common stock (the “Common Stock”) of the Company (such transaction, the “Share Purchase”). The Share Purchase was closed on June 1, 2018.
 
At the closing of the Share Purchase, there was a change in our board and executive officers. Ms. Jia Tian, the sole director, President, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company appointed Leung Kwok Hei to serve as a director and Chief Executive Officer and Chan Hiu as a director and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, with such appointment effective on June 1, 2018. Ms. Jia Tian resigned from all her positions with the Company effective on June 1, 2018.
 
Prior to our change in control, our product was the Global Seed Journal. It is a monthly journal published in Chinese for its presentation of Asian community news, advertising content, and articles written by contributors.
 
On October 1, 2019, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Well Benefit International Limited (“Well Benefit”), a British Virgin Islands company, and all of the shareholders of Well Benefit (the “Shareholders”) to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Well Benefit in exchange for the issuance to the Shareholders an aggregate of 252,874,025 shares of Common Stock (the “Reverse Merger”). The Reverse Merger is expected to be closed by the end of October 2019.
 
Dongguan Zhenghao Industrial Investment Company Limited (“Zhenghao”), a company formed under the laws of the People’s Republic of China, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Well Benefit. Upon closing of the Reverse Merger, we plan to provide healthy coffee and beverage products to customers in China through Zhenghao under its established brand, “Ka Su Le”.

Corporate Structure
 
The Company currently does not have any subsidiary. Upon closing of the Reverse Merger, Well Benefit will become our wholly-owned subsidiary and we expect our new corporate structure to be as follows.
Sales and Marketing
 
Given our current stage of development, we have not yet established commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We plan to build up a national network after we close the Reverse Merger.
Competition
 
The coffee and health beverage industry we plan to be in is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our products are likely to be store network, product quality and safety, product pricing, brand recognition and reputation and customer experience.
Employees
 
As of the date of this report, we do not have any employees, other than Mr. Leung Kwok Hei and Mr. Chan Hiu.
