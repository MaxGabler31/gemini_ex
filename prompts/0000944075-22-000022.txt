Mobile Markets. Our revenues are primarily driven by sales of barcode scanners integrated into mPOS (moble Point of Sale) applications used with Apple tablets and other mobile devices. Many mPOS application providers develop software for smaller retailers, an underserved market, using tablets as cash registers. Other mobile markets addressed by application providers include commercial services (field workers), asset tracking, manufacturing process and quality control, transportation and logistics (goods tracking and movement), event management (ticketing, entry, access control, and identification), medical and education. We expect these markets to increase the use of mobile applications and the demand for barcode scanners.
 
Expanded and improved product offerings. We offer a wide range of products that enable application providers and their consumers to design their mobile systems to meet their specific requirements, and we encourage our distributors to support the full range of our products. The goal is for customers to view Socket Mobile as a primary source for their mobile data capture needs. Our products include stand-alone barcode scanners in both durable and standard cases, attachable barcode scanners and RFID/NFC reader/writer. We provide a software developer kit to application providers to enable our advanced data capture software to be easily integrated into applications. See “Item 1 Business. The Company and its Products” for a more detailed description of our products.
 
We design our products to comply with the regulations of the many worldwide agencies that regulate the safety, performance and use of electronic products.
 
Competitive pricing. We have designed our products to be priced competitively although we are subject to changes in component pricing by our suppliers. We update our products from time to time and work with our vendors to achieve reductions in component pricing.
 
Worldwide product availability. We distribute our products through a worldwide distribution network that places products into geographic regions to shorten purchasing time and provides a credit shield to us. Our largest distributors are Ingram Micro®, ScanSource® and Blue Star, and they support a worldwide network of on-line resellers including Shopify®, Amazon.com, and CDW®. We also offer products on our own online stores.
 
Strong Brand Name. We believe that our products make a difference in the daily work life of mobile workers and the people they serve. We are building a brand image focused on business mobility. This image closely associates us with business mobility solutions and to reflect this image, we began doing business as Socket Mobile, Inc. in January 2007 and changed our legal name to Socket Mobile, Inc. in April 2008. We stress with customers the design of our products for the markets they serve, emphasizing quality and standards-based connectivity. Mobility requires products that are compact and designed to be handled while mobile, with low power consumption to extend time between charges, and easy to use. We strive to offer high performance products in a wide range of competitive prices. Through our developer support program, we work closely with application providers who are developing productivity enhancing applications for the mobile workforce. Our overall company brand identity and positioning goal is to be a leading provider of easy-to-deploy business mobility data capture systems to the business mobility market.

Competition and Competitive Risks
 
The overall market for mobile handheld data capture solutions is both complex and competitive. Our barcode scanning hardware products compete with similar hardware products in all our markets in the United States, Europe and Asia, and we differentiate our products with our software developer kit and our underlying data capture software designed to work with smartphones, tablets and other mobile computers running the Apple, Android and Windows operating systems. Our longtime focus on creating innovative mobile solutions for the mobile workforce has resulted in good brand name recognition and reputation. We believe that our brand name identifies our products as durable, dependable, ergonomic, and easy to use, all features designed for a mobile worker while mobile, and the breadth of our product offerings, including the extensive advanced features of our software and software developer kit, will continue to differentiate us relative to our competitors.
 
Cordless Barcode Scanning. We offer a full range of handheld cordless barcode scanners connecting to smartphones, tablets and other computing devices over Bluetooth. Our Software Developer Kit (Capture-SDK) enables application providers to integrate the features of our Data Capture software into their applications and helps differentiate our products. Our Cordless Barcode Scanners face competition from similar products from Koamtec, Code Corporation and Opticon (Japan). Barcodes may also be scanned using the built-in camera in smartphones or tablets with applications from Scandit or Manatee Works. However, scanning using the built-in camera is typically slower and harder to aim than a dedicated device. Users may choose a barcode scanner that connects directly to an Apple tablet, iPhone or computer such as offered by Infinite Peripherals and Honeywell. Users also may choose more rugged barcode scanners as an alternative, some of which are integrated into computing devices from manufacturers such as Datalogic, Honeywell®, and Zebra Technologies. Many of these devices are not Apple certified. Many connect to Apple devices over Bluetooth in keyboard emulation mode and do not offer extensive tools for application providers such as our software developer kit (Capture-SDK) to integrate features of our sophisticated data collection scanning software and hardware needed to meet the consumers’ requirement.
 
Contactless RFID/NFC Reader/Writer. We developed and commenced sales in 2017 of a Contactless RFID/NFC Reader/Writer, D600 version of our durable handheld barcode scanner. The D600 can read and write many different types of electronic SmartTags which are used in many applications today, like digital wallet applications for loyalty cards, identification cards, payment cards, coupons and event tickets. In 2020, we launched a Contactless Membership Card Reader/Writer, S550 which enables us to expand our business into the emerging market for tap-and-go solutions that have traditionally been limited to payment solutions, such as Apple Pay, but can now be used for ticketing, access and identification applications. We believe we are an early entrant into this market and do not face significant head to head competition from alternative reader/writer devices.
 
Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property
 
We have been granted 56 U.S. patents and 13 design patents and have other patent applications under review. We have registered trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the mark “Socket”, our logo, DuraScan, and SocketScan.
 
We have developed technological building blocks that enhance our ability to design new hardware and software products, to offer products which run on multiple software and hardware platforms, and to manufacture and package products efficiently.
 
We own and control the design of our barcode scanners, enabling us to modify its features or software to meet specific customer requirements.
