 Product Distribution  Each of the Companys operating units has its own sales staff, and maintains direct sales relationships with its customers. For those customers that buy from more than one business unit, the Company often assigns a single representative or team of specialists to handle that customers needs. Some of the units have service staff at the manufacturing facility that interact directly with customers. The Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment and certain operations within the Consumer Packaging segment have customer service centers located in Hartsville, South Carolina, which are the main contact points between their North American business units and their customers. Divisional sales personnel also provide sales management, marketing and product development assistance as needed. Typically, product distribution is directly from the manufacturing plant to the customer, but in some cases, product is warehoused in a mutually advantageous location to be shipped to the customer as needed. 
 Raw Materials  The principal raw materials used by the Company are recovered paper, paperboard, steel, aluminum and plastic resins. Raw materials are purchased from a number of outside sources. The Company considers the supply and availability of raw materials to be adequate to meet its needs. 
 Patents, Trademarks and Related Contracts  Most inventions and product and process innovations are generated by Sonocos development, marketing and engineering staffs, and are important to the Companys internal growth. Patents have been granted on many inventions created by Sonoco staff in the United States and in many other countries. Additionally, patents and trade secrets were acquired as part of several acquisitions over the past year, including the acquisition of Clear Lam and Packaging Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries, including Peninsula Packaging LLC. These patents are managed globally by a Sonoco intellectual capital management team through the Companys subsidiary, Sonoco Development, Inc. (SDI). SDI globally manages patents, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and license agreements. Some patents have been licensed to other manufacturers. Sonoco also licenses a few patents from outside companies and universities. U.S. patents expire after about 20 years, and patents on new innovations replace many of the abandoned or expired patents. A second intellectual capital subsidiary of Sonoco, SPC Resources, Inc., globally manages Sonocos trademarks, service marks, copyrights and Internet domain names. Most of Sonocos products are marketed worldwide under trademarks such as Sonoco®, SmartSeal®, Sonotube®, Sealclick®, Sonopost® and UltraSeal®. Sonocos registered web domain names such as www.sonoco.com and www.sonotube.com provide information about Sonoco, its people and its products. Trademarks and domain names are licensed to outside companies where appropriate. 

 Seasonality  The Companys operations are not seasonal to any significant degree, although the Consumer Packaging and Display and Packaging segments normally report slightly higher sales and operating profits in the second half of the year, when compared with the first half. 
 Working Capital Practices  The Company is not required to carry any significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements or to assure itself continuous allotment of goods. 
 Dependence on Customers  On an aggregate basis during 2017, the five largest customers in the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment, the Consumer Packaging segment and the Protective Solutions segment accounted for approximately 7%, 22% and 29%, respectively, of each segments net sales. The dependence on a few customers in the Display and Packaging segment is more significant, as the five largest customers in this segment accounted for approximately 53% of that segments sales. 
 Sales to the Companys largest customer represented approximately 4% of consolidated revenues in 2017. This concentration of sales volume resulted in a corresponding concentration of credit, representing approximately 4% of the Companys consolidated trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2017. The Companys next largest customer comprised approximately 3% of the Companys consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
 Backlog  Most customer orders are manufactured with a lead time of three weeks or less. Therefore, the amount of backlog orders at December 31, 2017, was not material. The Company expects all backlog orders at December 31, 2017, to be shipped during 2018. 
 Competition  The Company sells its products in highly competitive markets, which include paper, textile, film, food, chemical, packaging, construction, and wire and cable. All of these markets are influenced by the overall rate of economic activity and their behavior is principally driven by supply and demand. Because we operate in highly competitive markets, we regularly bid for new and continuing business. Losses and/or awards of business from our largest customers, customer changes to alternative forms of packaging, and the repricing of business, can have a significant effect on our operating results. The Company manufactures and sells many of its products globally. The Company, having operated internationally since 1923, considers its ability to serve its customers worldwide in a timely and consistent manner a competitive advantage. The Company also believes that its technological leadership, reputation for quality, and vertical integration are competitive advantages. Expansion of the Companys product lines and global presence is driven by the rapidly changing needs of its major customers, who demand high-quality, state-of-the-art, environmentally compatible packaging, wherever they choose to do business. It is important to be a low-cost producer in order to compete effectively. The Company is constantly focused on productivity improvements and other cost-reduction initiatives utilizing the latest in technology. 
 Research and Development  Company-sponsored research and development expenses totaled approximately $21.0 million in 2017, $22.5 million in 2016 and $22.1 million in 2015. Customer-sponsored research and development expenses were not material in any of these periods. Significant projects in Sonocos Consumer Packaging segment include a broad range of new and next generation product developments across flexible packaging, rigid plastic and composite packaging, including development of FlexValve integrated venting technology for flexible coffee packaging and PureShield powdered infant formula cans for emerging global markets. During 2017, the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment continued to invest in efforts to design and develop

   new products for the paper industry and for the film and textiles industries. In addition, efforts were focused on enhancing performance characteristics of the Companys tubes and cores in the construction, tape and paper packaging areas. Technology emphasis was also placed on delivering improved productivity via materials developments and key converting process improvements. Research and development projects in the Companys Protective Solutions segment were primarily focused on developing new temperature-assurance packaging solutions for the pharmaceuticals and clinical trials market.
