Item 1. Business 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “Centessa,” “the Company,” and “our Company” refer to Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Our Vision
We aim to be a Research & Development (“R&D”) innovation engine that discovers, develops and ultimately delivers impactful medicines to patients. We seek to pursue the best assets in a capital efficient manner with objective and strategic decision-making to rapidly progress our programs through development. Through our approach, we strive to deliver medicines that can lead to significant impact for patients who are desperately in need of new treatments.
Overview
Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc was formed in October 2020 with the purpose of bringing impactful new medicines to patients by combining the primary strengths of the asset-centric venture capital model with the benefits of diversification and scale typically attributed to traditional large R&D organizations. Medicxi formed Centessa with a view to ultimately acquiring several pre-revenue, development stage biotech companies, each of which was either controlled by and/or invested in by a fund affiliated with Medicxi or Index Ventures. On January 29, 2021, we acquired 11 biotechnology companies as direct subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Centessa Subsidiaries”) and simultaneously closed a Series A funding round of $250 million. Prior to the acquisition, our activities were limited mainly to engaging advisors and recruitment efforts. We commenced active operations after the consummation of the acquisitions. 
In June 2021, we completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of the ordinary shares through the sale and issuance of 16,500,000 American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”), at an initial price of $20.00 per ADS. Each ADS represents one ordinary share with a nominal value of £0.002 per ordinary share. Following the close of the IPO, the underwriters fully exercised their option to purchase an additional 2,475,000 ADSs at the initial public offering price of $20.00 per ADS. 
We operate as a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company with a Research & Development (“R&D”) innovation engine that aims to discover, develop and ultimately deliver impactful medicines to patients. Our model seeks to minimize infrastructure investment and fixed costs by incorporating extensive outsourced resources into our research and development model to optimize deployment of funds for discovery and development. We are led by a management team with extensive R&D experience from leading biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Our management team provides direct guidance to rapidly advance our programs from research through all stages of development through the integrated one-team structure of our operating model. The management team is also responsible for judicious capital and resource allocation decisions for discovery and development efforts across the portfolio and aims to expeditiously evaluate and potentially terminate programs when the data do not support advancing a program. 
Our programs span discovery-stage to late-stage development and cover a range of high-value indications in rare diseases and immuno-oncology. Our portfolio is dynamic as our management team continuously evaluates the programs. We currently have two programs which have established clinical proof of concept, with registrational trials ongoing for lixivaptan in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) and planned for SerpinPC in Hemophilia B this year; four emerging programs with clinical proof of concept anticipated in the next 18 months with LB101 in solid tumors, ZF874 in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), MGX292 in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH), and orexin agonists in Narcolepsy; and several exploratory programs including CBS001 in inflammatory / fibrotic diseases and CBS004 in autoimmune conditions. We aim to pursue programs we believe could be first-in-class / best-in-class in areas of significant unmet need. Where appropriate, we are also pursuing opportunities for agile, lean and potentially rapid development, including orphan drug designation, fast track designation, and other regulatory and development avenues. Based on our internal epidemiological-based market models, we believe each of our current programs, if approved, has the potential to compete in multi-billion dollar markets. 
We shared three clinical read-outs in 2021 for our Hemophilia, AATD, and ADPKD programs, and we plan to bring multiple programs into the clinic each year with further clinical read-outs expected across our portfolio. We believe our re-imagined drug discovery approach has the potential to further generate high-quality development candidates for continued expansion of our clinical stage portfolio. As a company focused on development of therapeutics, we intend to pursue a “develop to commercialize” approach for our programs with a relentless focus on efficiently delivering impactful medicines to patients. 
Our Operating Model
We have implemented a reimagined R&D model, leveraging the key strengths of the traditional R&D organization and the core tenets of the asset-centric venture capital model, which relies on focused teams pursuing assets against a single target or pathway. We believe that our approach will allow us to benefit from the characteristics of each model, while simultaneously removing the inefficiencies and potential challenges related to each. In particular, the convergence of scale, judicious allocation of capital and resources with a bias toward outsourcing, and singular focus enables our program teams to pursue development plans with an eye toward commercialization while maintaining flexibility to pursue strategic partnerships that leverage third-party expertise and synergies when warranted. Each of our Centessa Subsidiaries is currently maintained as a separate legal entity wholly owned by Centessa and each has global rights to its programs. Each Centessa Subsidiary exists with a clear purpose to address significant unmet patient need in a specific disease area, building on either precedented human activity or human genetics. 
All research activities related to each Centessa Subsidiary are conducted through a Research Excellence Hub. Each Research Excellence Hub is dedicated to pursuing pathway and/or disease domain-specific research with the aim of bringing assets through development candidate selection. Each is led by a subject matter expert based on their unique knowledge and expertise and is overseen by our Chief Innovation Officer (CIO). Once a development candidate (DC) is selected, the program is transitioned to a development program team. The integrated one-team development structure brings together cross-functional expertise to drive agile, lean and effective clinical development of the asset and is led by a Global Team Lead from the Centessa Global Development Organization and overseen by our Chief Medical Officer and our Chairman of Development. 
The Research Excellence Hub and development program teams are designed to be lean, with limited fixed costs to further enhance the economics of drug development, consistent with the asset-centric philosophy. To accomplish this aim, the teams rely on strategic Contract Research Organization (CRO) and Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) partners and consultants while maintaining a small, agile, and highly experienced core team of drug developers.

Our Pipeline 
Our programs span discovery-stage to late-stage development and cover a range of high-value indications. We aim to pursue programs we believe could be first-in-class / best-in-class and where there is prior learning in human genetics or precedented human activity for a pathway of interest. We place a premium on learnings from the clinic, whereby a drug has established the relevance of a biological pathway contributing to disease outcome. Our approach is to pursue the best assets in a capital efficient manner and rapidly progress our programs through development, evaluating the unique biological advantage of our product candidates. 
We categorize our current programs as registrational, emerging, or exploratory. Our R&D spend is commensurate with these three stages, with the highest spend on the programs that have already established clinical proof of concept. For programs in the earlier stages, we aim to implement capital-efficient plans to reach the next set of catalysts, gating more significant spending until after we obtain clinical proof of concept. 
•Registrational: Programs currently in or expected to enter registrational trials this year 
◦Lixivaptan in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD): Vasopressin V2 receptor small molecule inhibitor with potential to avoid safety issues associated with the only drug approved for the treatment of ADPKD, tolvaptan, which is associated with serious drug induced liver injury (DILI) and in the US is only available under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) distribution program. Lixivaptan is currently in a Phase 3 registrational trial for the treatment of ADPKD. We anticipate completing enrollment in the second half of 2023, and if results are supportive, plan to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) after completion of the one-year double-blind portion of the study.
◦SerpinPC in Hemophilia: Activated protein C (APC) inhibitor for Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B, which has been observed to be well-tolerated in the clinical setting, associated with promising reductions in bleeding rates, and which has PK suitable for infrequent subcutaneous dosing without the need for factor replacement. SerpinPC has human genetic target validation and established proof of concept Phase 2a clinical data. Registrational trials are planned to start for Hemophilia B in 2022, and plans for Hemophilia A are in development.
•Emerging: Programs / platforms with clinical proof of concept anticipated in the next 18 months
◦LB101 and LB201 in Solid Tumors: LB101, a PD-L1xCD47 LockBody®, is designed to selectively drive potent CD47 effector function activity while avoiding systemic toxicity. LB101 has two anti-CD47 domains blocked by two anti-PD-L1 domains, with proprietary human IgG-derived hinges linking the anti-CD47 and anti-PD-L1 domains. CD47 cell-killing is blocked by the PD-L1 tumor targeting domain until the IgG-derived hinges are naturally degraded in the tumor microenvironment (TME), thus 
unlocking and activating the CD47 effector function activity in the tumor. We expect to share foundational preclinical data at ASCO 2022, with an investigational new drug application (IND) for LB101 planned for late 2022. We anticipate establishing clinical proof of concept for LB101 in 2023 based on potential response rates in the planned Phase 1 study. LB201, a PD-L1xCD3 LockBody®, is designed to selectively drive potent CD3 effector function activity while avoiding systemic toxicity. IND for LB201 is planned for 2023. LB101 and LB201 are the first two from a platform of LockBody® programs.
◦ZF874 in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD): Small molecule pharmacological chaperone folding corrector of the Z variant of alpha-1-antitrypsin (Z-A1AT) intended to address the underlying pathology of both lung and liver manifestations of AATD. ZF874 is currently in Phase 1 clinical development, and we expect to share clinical proof of concept data from multiple dose cohorts with PiMZ and PiZZ subjects in the second half of 2022. We also plan to initiate a global Phase 2 study, including a 6-month continuous dosing portion with paired liver biopsy, contingent on completion of the human dose justification work ongoing in the Phase 1 study.
◦MGX292 in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH): Recombinant modified BMP9 replacement protein designed to overcome the deficiency in BMP9 signaling in PAH, directly targeting a central underlying disease mechanism (BMP9/BMPR2/ALK1 signaling pathway genetically altered in PAH). An IND is planned for early 2023, and we anticipate early clinical proof of concept from the first in human study during 2023.
◦OX2R Agonists (Oral and Intranasal) in Narcolepsy Type 1 (NT1): Selective orexin receptor 2 (OX2R) agonists designed to leverage unique structural insights and to directly target the underlying pathophysiology of orexin neuron loss in NT1. Potential expansion into Narcolepsy Type 2 (NT2), rare hypersomnias, and additional disorders. INDs/CTAs are planned for 2023, and we anticipate early clinical proof of concept to be established in the Phase 1 study in 2023.
•Exploratory: Programs with potential to become Emerging Programs (clinical proof of concept beyond 18 months)
◦CBS001 in inflammatory / fibrotic diseases: High-affinity anti-LIGHT antibody, which preferentially binds the inflammatory membrane form of LIGHT. We have received authorization from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to start a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers (planned to start in the second quarter of 2022). 
◦CBS004 in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Other Autoimmune Diseases: Humanized mAb specific to BDCA2, which is expressed exclusively on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). An IND is planned for late 2022.
As part of ongoing portfolio management, we continuously review all of our programs with the goal of assembling a pipeline of product candidates with the potential to be first in class / best in class assets. We are not dependent on any one program or therapeutic area within our product portfolio. Our portfolio decisions reflect the responsibility of the management team to expeditiously evaluate and potentially increase resources or suspend development based on whether the product profile or data meet our criteria for further investment. In particular, we apply our criteria to each program individually and evaluate the merits of each program individually and not in comparison to other programs in our pipeline. As a result, we have recently determined to: (1) discontinue the small molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon20 insertion mutation inhibitor program and C797S mutation inhibitor program for the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC); (2) evaluate strategic options including potential divestment for imgatuzumab, an anti-EGFR mAb; and (3) discontinue internal funding for the lead dual-STAT3/5 degrader program in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). 
The below pipeline chart represents our current programs, including the disease area, mechanism of action, next milestone, and stage of development.
Registrational Programs
Lixivaptan in ADPKD
Summary
We are developing lixivaptan, an oral, non-peptide, new chemical agent that is designed to selectively suppress the activity of the hormone vasopressin at the V2 receptor and to deliver a differentiated profile for patients with ADPKD. We are evaluating the potential of lixivaptan to slow the loss in renal function that is typically observed in ADPKD patients while avoiding liver safety issues associated with JYNARQUE®, a form of branded tolvaptan which is the only drug currently approved for ADPKD. We are currently conducting a global Phase 3 registrational clinical trial, designated the ACTION Study, with the first subject dosed on lixivaptan in February 2022. Lixivaptan is from our subsidiary Palladio Biosciences, Inc. (Palladio). 
Disease Overview
ADPKD is a hereditary disorder characterized by the formation and enlargement of cysts in the kidney, liver, and other organs. It is the fourth leading cause of kidney failure in the U.S. and one of the most common inherited genetic diseases in humans, occurring equally in women and men, in all races, globally. There are an estimated 140,000 diagnosed ADPKD patients in the U.S.
ADPKD results from loss-of-function mutations in one of two related genes, PKD1 or PKD2, which encode for the gene products Polycystin 1 and Polycystin 2, respectively. These defects disrupt the normal differentiated phenotype of the renal tubular epithelium, leading to increases in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and resulting in increased cellular proliferation and cyst formation throughout the life of a patient. Progressive enlargement of the kidneys caused by ADPKD may result in severely enlarged and distorted kidneys. Whereas a normal kidney is usually about the size of a human fist and weighs around six ounces, kidneys affected by ADPKD can be as large as a football and may weigh 30 pounds. In ADPKD, cyst growth displaces and destroys normal kidney tissue, leading to a decreased number and function of nephrons. As normally functioning kidney tissue is replaced, the kidney’s ability to function decreases. Although compensatory hyperfiltration can maintain kidney function within a normal range for some periods of time, ADPKD patients often experience hypertension, acute and chronic pain, kidney stones, and hematuria as well as cyst and urinary tract infections even when kidney function appears normal. Eventually, the majority of ADPKD patients experience end stage kidney failure and require dialysis or kidney transplantation.

Competition and Market Opportunity
There is no cure for ADPKD. Only one drug, tolvaptan, has been approved for treatment of ADPKD. Tolvaptan, like lixivaptan, is a non-peptide vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist in the drug class of vaptans. Additional treatments for ADPKD patients are intended to manage conditions associated with the disease, such as hypertension, kidney infections, gout, kidney stones and pain.
Tolvaptan was first approved for the treatment of low sodium in the blood (hyponatremia) conditions. It has now also been approved for the treatment of ADPKD in Japan, Canada, Europe, the U.S. and other major markets. It is marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka) for ADPKD under the tradename of JINARC® in Canada, Europe and other countries. It was approved in the United States in April 2018 for slowing kidney function decline in adults at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD and is marketed in the U.S. by Otsuka under the tradename of JYNARQUE®. In 2021, U.S. sales of JYNARQUE® totaled approximately $770 million. Approximately 8,000 patients have been treated with JYNARQUE® in the U.S. since its approval. With the latest patent in the Orange Book, the anticipated patent term for JYNARQUE® would expire in April 2030. 
However, the use of tolvaptan for the treatment of ADPKD is associated with serious drug induced liver injury (DILI). Consequently, the labeling for tolvaptan for ADPKD carries a prominent DILI warning with requirements for extensive liver function monitoring while patients take the drug. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also mandated a REMS program as a condition of approval for tolvaptan for ADPKD. A REMS program is a drug safety program that the FDA can require for certain medications with serious safety concerns. JYNARQUE® prescribers must enroll and be certified in the REMS program. Patients must also enroll and are required to submit frequent blood tests to monitor for liver toxicity.
Other potential treatments for ADPKD are being pursued by multiple companies. Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Reata) is pursuing bardoxolone, an oral once-daily activator of Nrf2, and is conducting Phase 3 trials in ADPKD. Reata has made recent changes to its protocol following their Type B meeting with the FDA, including increasing the enrollment target and confirming the primary endpoint for approval will be measured after 2 years on drug. Separately, Reata recently received a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for bardoxolone in Alport Syndrome on the basis that the agency does not believe the data demonstrate bardoxolone is effective in slowing loss of kidney function and reducing the 
risk of progression to kidney failure. The CRL follows a negative vote from the FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee. There are several other investigational products in earlier stages of clinical development, including GLPG2737, a Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) inhibitor being investigated by Galapagos NV (Galapagos) in Phase 2 clinical development and RGLS4326, an inhibitor of miR-17 being investigated by Regulus Therapeutics Inc. (Regulus) in Phase 1 clinical development, as well as preclinical programs including AT-20494, a selective rapamycin analog mTORC1 inhibitor being investigated by Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Janssen). Sanofi S.A. (Sanofi) announced in June 2021 that it was discontinuing its program to evaluate venglustat, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), in ADPKD after the pivotal Phase 2/3 study did not meet futility criteria. 
Market research conducted in the U.S. suggests that less than half of patients who are considered good clinical candidates for tolvaptan are actually prescribed the drug. Liver toxicity is cited as a major deterrent to using tolvaptan for many patients. The REMS program brings additional burden to both physicians and patients, which has also impacted market adoption of JYNARQUE®. We believe that if approved, lixivaptan has the potential to address unmet need for patients currently on tolvaptan, patients who may have discontinued tolvaptan, and treatment-naïve patients. 
Our Product Candidate
We believe that lixivaptan may offer similar therapeutic activity in treating ADPKD as compared to tolvaptan while avoiding the DILI associated with tolvaptan use in this patient population. Because vasopressin is the principal agonist pathway leading to the formation of cAMP in kidney tubule cells, therapeutic interventions aimed at counterbalancing the effect of vasopressin and/or normalizing intracellular levels of cAMP were hypothesized as possible treatments to delay disease progression in ADPKD, as supported by animal models and preclinical work. Definitive evidence in favor of the utility of vasopressin antagonism as a therapeutic approach for ADPKD is derived from clinical and therapeutic experience with tolvaptan.
Lixivaptan’s development program for ADPKD builds on a historical, extensive development program conducted by our licensors in investigating lixivaptan for the treatment of hyponatremia. This work included 36 completed clinical studies in which more than 1,600 subjects were dosed with lixivaptan, the results from which we believe support lixivaptan’s activity on key measures believed to be important for ADPKD. In addition, upon systematic review of the existing clinical safety and tolerability data by the company, we did not identify any signal of potential hepatotoxicity in the prior development program for hyponatremia, albeit at a different dose and regimen and with a different underlying pathology.
Prior to administering lixivaptan to ADPKD patients, we studied lixivaptan’s liver safety profile, as compared to tolvaptan, by utilizing DILIsym, a state-of-the art, predictive, quantitative systems toxicology modeling tool developed by the DILIsym Consortium in collaboration with the U.S. FDA and industry partners. DILIsym representations predicted that lixivaptan is not likely to cause DILI and may be better tolerated than tolvaptan with respect to the mechanisms of liver toxicity currently represented in DILIsym. The results of this work were published in a peer-reviewed journal.
We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial, designated the ELiSA Study (Evaluation of Lixivaptan in Subjects with ADPKD). This study showed that lixivaptan has potent vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist activity in patients with ADPKD with varying degrees of kidney function (chronic kidney disease stages CKD1 through CKD3). The study also defined the dose range for further Phase 3 studies. Lixivaptan was well tolerated at the doses given, with adverse events (AEs) consistent with previous studies in non-ADPKD patients. No liver toxicity signals were noted.
We have also completed a clinical study in a single subject with intractable pain due to ADPKD who was required to discontinue tolvaptan treatment due to clinically significant abnormalities in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a sign of liver toxicity, on each of three sequential attempts to initiate treatment with tolvaptan. The patient was subsequently treated with lixivaptan for more than 14 months with no abnormalities in ALT or other liver chemistry tests.
We are currently conducting an open-label, non-registrational repeat-dose study, designated the ALERT Study, which is designed to assess hepatic and non-hepatic safety of lixivaptan in patients who previously experienced abnormal liver chemistry test results that met the criteria for DILI while undergoing treatment with tolvaptan and who were permanently discontinued from tolvaptan for that reason. Initial safety data on the first four subjects in the ALERT Study showed that they successfully titrated to the maintenance dose of lixivaptan and no subjects met the pre-specified stopping criteria. 
We are also currently conducting a global, registrational Phase 3 study, designated the ACTION Study, which is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lixivaptan in subjects with ADPKD. The first subject in this study was dosed on lixivaptan in February 2022.
Clinical Data
In addition to our clinical trial data to-date in ADPKD, discussed below, lixivaptan has shown activity in preclinical models in established models of PKD. Historically, lixivaptan has also been investigated in over 30 additional trials by our licensors in hyponatremia.
Completed Trials
The ELiSA Study. PA-102—A Phase 2, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lixivaptan in subjects with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
The ELiSA study was a Phase 2, open-label, parallel-group, multiple dose, multi-center study conducted to directly characterize the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics (pharmacologic response) of lixivaptan in ADPKD subjects with different degrees of renal function impairment. The study used administration of twice daily oral doses of 50 mg and 200 mg for seven days in subjects with both ADPKD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 1, stage 2 or stage 3. Chronic kidney disease is categorized into five stages based on how well the kidneys can filter waste and extra fluid out of the blood, corresponding to mild damage in stage 1 to complete kidney failure in stage 5. These safety, PK and PD assessments are being used to guide appropriate lixivaptan dosing recommendations for subjects with ADPKD and mild or moderate CKD in future clinical studies.
Study PA-102 enrolled a total of 31 subjects diagnosed with ADPKD who were assigned to four cohorts based on baseline renal function and treated with one of two doses of lixivaptan for seven days, twice daily (BID), as illustrated in Figure 2 below:
Figure 2: PA-102 dosing and CKD stage cohorts.
Subjects were confined to the clinical research unit (CRU) during the critical periods of data collection at the initiation and completion of dosing. Safety assessments included clinical laboratory findings, 12-lead electrocardiography (ECGs), vital signs, physical examination findings, adverse event monitoring, and a tolerability questionnaire. PD assessments included concentration of dissolved chemicals in the urine (osmolality) and urine output, total kidney volume (TKV) and liver volume (LV) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plasma copeptin, and serum creatinine to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). PK assessments included determination of lixivaptan and metabolite concentrations over the PK sampling period (0-14 hours). The design of PA-102 is summarized in the graphic below.
Figure 3: Schematic representation of the ELiSA Study, PA-102 trial design.
Lixivaptan was well-tolerated across all cohorts, with all 31 subjects having completed the study. There were no deaths, serious AEs, or treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), leading to discontinuation from the study. Fifteen subjects experienced at least one TEAE, which were mild or moderate in severity. The most common AEs observed were dry mouth, headache, nausea, diarrhea, flank pain, paresthesia, syncope and thirst. In addition, no abnormal changes in additional measured biomarkers such as ALT were observed.
In addition to the assessment of AEs, all subjects were asked to complete a tolerability questionnaire after the first and seventh days of dosing with lixivaptan. At the final assessment, 81% of the subjects indicated they could tolerate continuing on the drug for at least the next 12 months. All subjects indicated they would be prepared to recommend lixivaptan to another patient.
The PK profile of lixivaptan and its metabolites in ADPKD patients in study PA-102 was clinically equivalent to the PK profile in healthy volunteers. The PK profile of 50 mg and 200 mg BID doses of lixivaptan on day seven is shown in the figure below.
Figure 4: Mean (± standard deviation) plasma concentrations of lixivaptan (VPA-985) observed on day 7 after twice-daily oral doses of 200 mg and 50 mg in ADPKD subjects in the ELiSA Study, PA-102.
Importantly, we observed a dose-dependent reduction in mean urine osmolality following lixivaptan administration, which we believe indicated blockade of the vasopressin V2 receptor over 24 hours on a twice a day dosing scheme at 200 mg BID.
Figure 5: Time Course of Mean Spot Urine Osmolality.
The percentage of ADPKD subjects achieving adequate suppression of urine osmolality after seven days of dosing with lixivaptan in the PA-102 study compared to published results for tolvaptan are shown in the figure below. No head-to-head studies of lixivaptan and tolvaptan have been conducted.
Figure 6: Percentage of subjects meeting the trough urine osmolality (Uosm) suppression target criterion (Uosm <300 mOsm/kg) at steady state on tolvaptan (ADPKD subjects in TEMPO trial) and lixivaptan (ADPKD subjects at multiple doses in the ELiSA Study, PA-102).
Based on these results, we believe the minimum efficacious daily dose is likely to be 100 mg BID with a maximum dose of 200 mg BID. The 50 mg BID dose is considered a starting dose to acquaint subjects with the aquaretic effects of the drug. Other changes in PD parameters for serum sodium, eGFR and plasma copeptin were consistent with the expected activity of the vaptan class of drugs in ADPKD patients.
In conclusion, we believe results from PA-102 suggest that lixivaptan may be a potent vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist with meaningful activity on urine osmolality, serum sodium, eGFR and plasma copeptin in subjects with ADPKD, and with a good tolerability profile and AEs that are consistent with previous studies.
PA-103: An Expanded Access Study of Lixivaptan in a Single Subject with Intractable Pain Due to Polycystic Kidney Disease
Study PA-103 was an open-label, single-arm, repeat dose expanded access study in a single subject with ADPKD who had been incapacitated by ADPKD-related abdominal pain. Pain is a frequent complication of ADPKD and clinical data with tolvaptan suggest that vaptan therapy may help alleviate pain. In this study, increasing doses of lixivaptan were provided to improve the marked abdominal pain that the subject was experiencing. Doses up to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening were allowed during the titration period and subsequently were allowed to increase to 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening in the maintenance period. Liver chemistry tests, scales for quality of life and pain and AEs were monitored frequently during both the titration and maintenance periods.
Figure 7: Schematic representation of PA-103 Expanded Access Study trial design.
This subject was previously treated for the pain with tolvaptan but was unable to continue with the drug because of DILI, which manifested as elevated serum ALT levels that occurred on three separate occasions while on tolvaptan. The subject’s previous dosing and ALT levels on tolvaptan are shown in the chart below.
Figure 8: Serum ALT levels and tolvaptan daily dose over time in an ADPKD
subject with severe abdominal pain treated with tolvaptan in 2017.
The subject started dosing with lixivaptan in May 2019. The dosing record and ALT levels through study completion in July 2020 are shown in the chart below.
Figure 9: Serum ALT levels and lixivaptan daily dose over time in an ADPKD
subject with severe abdominal pain treated with lixivaptan starting in 2019.
Lixivaptan was well-tolerated by the subject in the study. The only AE reported determined to be definitely related to the study drug was increased urine output. Importantly, the subject completed 415 days of treatment with lixivaptan without any evidence of liver injury. All liver chemistry tests were normal while the subject had been receiving lixivaptan.
The subject’s pain and quality of life modestly and mostly transiently improved while on lixivaptan therapy, but because of continued discomfort the subject elected to discontinue lixivaptan in order to pursue more aggressive pain management treatments.
While we believe the encouraging results from this study support the differentiated profile of lixivaptan in ADPKD, the study enrolled only a single patient. As a result, we are continuing to investigate lixivaptan in trials with larger patient populations to generate data to support further development of this candidate.
Ongoing Trials and Development Plan
ACTION Study
We are currently conducting a global, registrational Phase 3 study, designated the ACTION Study, which is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lixivaptan that has been titrated to a maximum tolerated dose between 100-200 mg BID in subjects with ADPKD and a Mayo Clinic MRI imaging classification of 1C, 1D, or 1E and an eGFR ≥25 and ≤90 mL/min/1.73m2. The first subject was dosed on lixivaptan in February 2022. The ACTION Study, PA-ADPKD 301, is a two-arm trial consisting of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase (Part 1) followed by a single-arm open-label phase (Part 2).
In Part 1, all subjects will receive placebo and all subjects will receive lixivaptan to establish dosing. Up to 1,350 subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive lixivaptan or placebo. After 52 weeks of randomized treatment, the administration of study drug will be paused, and final eGFR assessments for Part 1 will be obtained during three follow-up visits starting over a period of 28 days. 
The primary analysis of the ACTION Study will be performed at the end of Part 1 of the trial to assess lixivaptan in slowing the decline in renal function as measured at 52 weeks by the difference in eGFR between the lixivaptan-treated and placebo-treated subjects. 
All subjects completing Part 1 are expected to continue into Part 2 of the study and be treated with the active drug, lixivaptan, for an additional 54-56 weeks. At the end of that time, study drug will be discontinued, and final eGFR assessments for Part 2 will be obtained during three follow-up visits starting over a period of 28 days. The design of the trial is summarized in the graphic below. Both parts of the study will contribute to further evaluating the safety profile of lixivaptan. An independent data monitoring committee will periodically review all safety data, including the liver chemistry data for all subjects, throughout the study. 
Prior to the Russia-Ukraine war, we had planned to utilize clinical trial sites in Russia and Ukraine as part of the ACTION Study. We have now determined not to proceed with clinical sites in these countries and are in the process of identifying alternative sites to replace the sites previously identified in Russia and Ukraine. We have not yet determined the potential impact, if any, of these planned site changes on our enrollment timelines, and for now still anticipate completing enrollment in the second half of 2023. If results are supportive, we plan to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA after completion of the one-year double-blind portion of the study (Part 1).

ALERT Study
The ALERT Study, PA-ADPKD-303, is an open-label, non-registrational repeat-dose study designed to assess hepatic and non-hepatic safety of lixivaptan in patients who previously experienced abnormal liver chemistry test results that met the criteria for DILI while undergoing treatment with tolvaptan and who were permanently discontinued from tolvaptan for that reason. Subjects in the ALERT Study undergo up to 8 weeks of screening followed by a three-week baseline measurement period and then a three- to six-week titration phase with lixivaptan, with weekly liver chemistry test monitoring during the baseline and titration phases. During the maintenance phase, liver chemistry tests are obtained every four weeks. The primary outcome measure in the study is the proportion of subjects who develop alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels >3x upper limit of normal (ULN) adjudicated to be related to lixivaptan resulting in discontinuation of the study drug. The design of the ALERT Study is summarized in the graphic below. 
Figure 11: Schematic representation of the ALERT Study, PA-ADPKD-303 trial design.
The initial four subjects enrolled in the Study had previously had cases of DILI while being treated with tolvaptan for ADPKD and had ALT elevations that peaked between 1.8x and 3.5x ULN and did not return to below ULN until 23 to 140 days after tolvaptan use was discontinued. Each of these subjects was successfully titrated to a maintenance dose of lixivaptan of either 100 mg BID (one subject) or 200 mg BID (three subjects) and entered the maintenance phase of the study. 
As of the data cutoff on December 3, 2021, three out of four subjects remained on lixivaptan with the longest treatment duration being 366 days, and the remaining subjects at 174 days and 172 days on treatment. One subject successfully titrated to 200 mg BID lixivaptan but withdrew consent after 93 days of dosing. No subjects had clinically meaningful ALT elevations attributed to lixivaptan and no subjects met the pre-specified stopping criteria of an ALT level >3x ULN.
The ALERT Study continues to enroll, and there is an ALERT Extension Study for subjects who continue on treatment after 52 weeks. We do not currently anticipate releasing additional data from the ALERT Study until it is completed and the results can be presented in a scientific forum.
Product Exclusivity
Lixivaptan is a new chemical entity (NCE) that has never been approved or launched for any indication anywhere in the world. While the composition of matter patent for lixivaptan has expired, we are pursuing, through a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent application, worldwide patents for polycystic disease indications (including ADPKD), method of use, formulations, and dosage regimens. On February 8, 2022, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a patent entitled “Formulations of Lixivaptan for the Treatment of Polycystic Disease,” which has claims drawn to using a divided dose regimen of lixivaptan in treating ADPKD. The patent term expires June 8, 2038, before consideration of any applicable patent term extensions or adjustments. See “—Intellectual Property and License Agreements.” Commercial exclusivity of lixivaptan for the treatment of ADPKD is expected through a combination of existing and additional patent filings, patent term extension, as available, and regulatory and data exclusivity provisions of various countries. Time periods for data exclusivity vary by region, with U.S. NCE exclusivity lasting for five years and the EU generally providing ten years of exclusivity. In addition, the FDA has granted orphan drug designation for lixivaptan for ADPKD. This designation is designed to provide eligibility for certain benefits and confers seven years of market exclusivity if the product receives the first FDA approval for that drug for the disease for which it has such designation.
SerpinPC in Hemophilia A and B
Summary
We are developing SerpinPC for the treatment of Hemophilia A (HA) and Hemophilia B (HB). Hemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder that is caused by a deficiency of thrombin generation upon vascular damage. SerpinPC, a biologic of the serpin family of proteins, is designed to allow more thrombin to be generated by inhibiting Activated Protein C (APC). Our approach is to rebalance coagulation in hemophilia by decreasing a single anticoagulant force. We believe SerpinPC has the potential to treat all types of hemophilia regardless of severity or inhibitor status and may also prevent bleeding associated with other bleeding disorders. We have completed Phase 2a studies in HA and HB subjects and are currently preparing for registrational trials. We have recently completed pre-IND interactions with the FDA. The FDA considered these to be very consistent with an end of Phase 2 meeting, and based on the FDA feedback, we are proceeding with a streamlined, integrated development plan with fewer than 200 total subjects. If results based on this plan are positive, we intend to seek marketing approval in adults and adolescents with Hemophilia B, with and without inhibitors, as the initial indication. As we are preparing to enter registrational trials sooner than previously anticipated, we are working with the FDA on our plans to accelerate product process development and qualification activities. In parallel, we are working on a registrational plan for HA and are actively engaging other health authorities around the world to discuss our regulatory plans outside of the US. SerpinPC is from our subsidiary ApcinteX Limited (ApcinteX). 
Disease Overview
HA and HB are X-linked genetic disorders affecting one in 5,000 and one in 20,000 live male births, respectively, resulting in spontaneous internal bleeding that can be life-threatening. More than 70% of bleeds occur into joints (hemarthrosis) causing chronic joint damage (arthropathy) with musculoskeletal destruction. Estimates of the global prevalence of HA and HB vary between 400,000 and 450,000. The World Federation of Hemophilia identified 241,535 registered persons with hemophilia in its 2020 annual report. In the U.S., the report identified approximately 15,000 persons with hemophilia; however, estimated prevalence rates suggest there are over 25,000 persons with hemophilia. Approximately 75% are persons with HA and 25% are persons with HB. The report identified approximately 31,000 
persons with hemophilia in the five major European markets (defined as France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK). Approximately 80-85% are persons with HA, and the remainder are persons with HB. Estimates of the prevalence of hemophilia in China is approximately 18,000. In India, approximately 23,000 persons are known to have hemophilia, but it is thought that 80% of cases are unknown. There are similarly large populations of persons with hemophilia in South America.
The bleeding associated with these disorders is the result of a defect or deficiency in factor (f)VIII (in the case of HA) or fIX (in the case of HB), the two components of the intrinsic tenase complex. Normal blood coagulation (hemostasis) is a crucial part of the physiological response to tissue damage. When blood components come into contact with extravascular cells and proteins, platelets accumulate and ultimately lead to the formation of thrombin, the effector enzyme of blood coagulation. Prothrombinase activity is required for the rapid, localized production of thrombin needed for adequate blood clotting. Prothrombinase is continuously degraded by APC, which is present in the circulation at low concentrations. In the setting of deficient intrinsic tenase activity (hemophilia), the natural anticoagulant activity of the circulating APC results in insufficient prothrombinase activity for normal blood clotting.
Hemophilia is characterized as severe, moderate and mild, corresponding to <1%, 1% to 5% and >5% factor activity, respectively. Bleeding often becomes noticeable after a child becomes mobile. Hemarthrosis manifests as swelling and pain in the joints, along with decreased range of motion, most commonly affecting the knees, ankles and elbows. Other common manifestations include bruising, which can be spontaneous or occur after minor trauma, gum bleeding and nose bleeds. Persons with severe hemophilia often suffer spontaneous joint bleeds between 20 and 50 times a year. Spontaneous bleeding is less frequent in persons with moderate hemophilia, but in many individuals this condition is still problematic because only two or three bleeds into a joint are sufficient to cause permanent joint damage, and because the frequency of bleeds does not warrant the treatment burden of regular intravenous (IV) prophylactic treatment with replacement factor.
Competition and Market Opportunity
The global market for hemophilia is estimated at over $12 billion as of 2021. Only 20% of persons with hemophilia globally are believed to have access to adequate therapy.
The standard treatment for hemophilia consists of replacing the missing or defective fVIII or fIX by intravenous infusion of partially purified plasma-derived or recombinant fVIII or fIX protein, known as factor concentrate. Factor concentrate is administered either when bleeding occurs, known as on-demand therapy, or regularly to prevent bleeding, known as prophylaxis. Prophylaxis with standard factor concentrates requires intravenous infusion every second or third day in order to reduce annualized bleeding rates (ABR) to single figures. Less frequent intravenous infusion is required with recently approved extended half-life products. Emicizumab (marketed as HEMLIBRA® by Roche) is a synthetic fVIII mimetic replacement therapy that is changing the treatment paradigm in HA. Emicizumab’s main benefit is as a substitute for factor VIII in persons with HA with fVIII inhibitors (high-titer antibodies against fVIII), and as an infrequent subcutaneously administered prophylactic in HA without inhibitors. Emicizumab has no activity in HB. 
Because the replacement factor is effectively a foreign protein treatment, it is often associated with the formation of inhibitory antibodies which requires the use of a different class of therapeutics called bypass agents. Bypass agents increase thrombin generation through mechanisms independent of the intrinsic tenase complex. The most commonly used bypass agents are recombinant fVIIa and FEIBA. However, the use of these agents is limited by their short half-lives and result in variable responses in patients. They are also less effective than replacement therapy before inhibitors were developed and are rarely used prophylactically.
All approved agents for the treatment of hemophilia improve thrombin generation by bolstering the levels of procoagulant factors. An alternative approach is to reduce the efficiency of natural anticoagulant mechanisms. These include inhibition of Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) with antibodies such as marstacimab being investigated by Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) and concizumab being investigated by Novo Nordisk A/S (Novo Nordisk) both in Phase 3 clinical development, and knocking down antithrombin levels with an RNA interference such as fitusiran, also in Phase 3 clinical development, being investigated by Sanofi. In addition to these approaches, gene therapies for HA and HB are being developed including several in Phase 3 clinical development: roctavian being investigated by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BioMarin) and giroctocogene fitelparvovec (SB-525) being investigated by Pfizer and Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (Sangamo) in HA and EtranaDez being investigated by CSL Behring and UniQure and fidanacogene elaparvovec (SPK-9001) being investigated by Pfizer and Spark Therapeutics in HB. Although gene therapies could be a significant development for patients, they face uncertainty regarding safety, durability and cost and are specific to either HA and HB.
Despite advances in hemophilia treatment, there remains a considerable unmet need in both HA and HB:
•Factor concentrate therapies require intravenous administration making prophylaxis challenging;
•Up to 30% of persons with HA and 3% of persons with HB develop inhibitory antibodies to factor concentrates, which limits effectiveness of treatment with factor concentrates;
•The non-factor replacement therapies, both approved and in development, are associated with the risk of thrombosis; and
•The majority of persons with hemophilia have no or limited access to prophylactic treatment to prevent bleeding.
We believe that if approved, SerpinPC has the potential to address unmet need for existing and newly diagnosed patients with hemophilia. Although our development plan will include both HA and HB subjects, the initial focus of our registration efforts will be HB, with and without inhibitors, given the higher unmet need and market opportunity in this patient population, who currently do not have alternatives to intravenous factor concentrate.
Our Product Candidate 
The protein C (PC) pathway is essential for regulating thrombin generation to avoid excessive blood coagulation. Severe PC deficiency (<5% of normal protein levels) results in widespread thrombosis, called purpura fulminans. PC is the precursor of APC, and is converted to APC when excess thrombin is generated. APC destroys the prothrombinase and intrinsic tenase complexes by cleavage of fVa and fVIIIa, respectively. The fV Leiden gene mutation present in 3% of the caucasian population causes partial resistance of prothrombinase to APC, and is sufficient to reduce bleeding in persons with severe hemophilia who coinherit the relatively common fV Leiden mutation. This was the genetic human proof-of-concept supporting APC inhibition as a treatment for persons with hemophilia.
 We believe that the PC system is particularly attractive because partial APC resistance conferred by coinheritance of fV Leiden provides an early proof-of-concept in humans. The mode of action (MOA) of SerpinPC is to reduce levels of circulating APC, thereby prolonging activity of prothrombinase formed during the initiation stage of hemostasis and directly increasing the amount of thrombin generated at the site of tissue damage.
Figure 12: Schematic of the MOA for SerpinPC.
As depicted in Figure 12, thrombin is the effector enzyme in blood coagulation, and is produced by an enzyme complex known as prothrombinase, composed of fXa and fVa. At the initiation stage of blood coagulation, the fXa is produced by the extrinsic tenase complex while the fVa comes from platelets. This ‘early prothrombinase’ formation is preserved in hemophilia. However, early prothrombinase is inactivated by APC in the blood, so insufficient thrombin is produced to form a stable hemostatic clot, resulting in continued bleeding, unless more prothrombinase can be formed with 
the help of the intrinsic tenase complex. The two components of the intrinsic tenase complex are missing in HA and HB. SerpinPC treatment is designed to reduce the levels of APC so that the early prothrombinase has time to produce enough thrombin to form a stable hemostatic clot, thereby preventing excessive blood loss. This expected MOA has a finite and maximal effect when all circulating APC is inhibited by SerpinPC.
SerpinPC is a variant of the serpin alpha-1-antitrypsin, modified to be a specific inhibitor of APC. We were able to convert A1AT into a specific inhibitor of APC by mutating 3 residues in the reactive center loop of the molecule. The serpin mechanism traps the protease during cleavage of the reactive center loop as a covalent complex, and therefore has an absolute requirement that the protease is active, i.e., not the inactive zymogen. For this reason, SerpinPC is designed to have complete specificity for APC over PC, and therefore is not expected to deplete the circulating concentration of PC. Consequently, when conditions favor APC generation (i.e., excessive thrombin generation) PC is available for conversion to APC to effect its anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic functions. Because SerpinPC is a relatively slow inhibitor of APC (second-order rate constant of 15,000 M-1s-1) it does not rapidly neutralize newly formed APC, preserving these functions at clinically-relevant doses. At the Cmax for the highest clinical dose, it takes 10 minutes to inhibit half of the newly formed APC, sufficient time to effect its signaling and antithrombic functions. However, the covalent nature of the inhibitory mechanism enables low concentrations of SerpinPC in the blood to ‘mop up’ APC with time. In preclinical studies, it was demonstrated that normalization of bleeding in hemophilia mouse models required the lowering of the circulating APC levels and was not related to the SerpinPC exposure at the time of challenge. SerpinPC has favorable subcutaneous bioavailability, tolerability profile and PK potentially suitable for monthly dosing.
In the Phase 2a part of AP-0101, the six-month repeat dose portion of the ongoing first-in-human study evaluating SerpinPC in severe HA and HB subjects described below, SerpinPC was observed to be well-tolerated. There was no reported sustained elevation in D-dimer, a sensitive measure of excess thrombin generation, throughout the 24-week study. In the highest dose cohort, SerpinPC reduced the self-reported all bleeds ABR by 88% during the last 12 weeks of treatment (pre-specified primary assessment period) as compared to the all bleeds ABR prospectively measured during the pre-exposure observation period. In the highest dose cohort, five out of eight subjects had zero or one bleed during the 12-week pre-specified primary assessment period. Self-reported spontaneous joint bleeds ABR was reduced by 94% in the highest dose cohort. ABR reductions were similar between patients with either HA or HB.
SerpinPC is designed as a long-acting non-replacement therapy intended to be administered as an infrequent injection under the skin that ‘rebalances’ blood coagulation without the need for factor replacement. As a result, we believe SerpinPC could be an attractive alternative therapy for many patients, if approved. Other rebalancing approaches have been plagued by incidences of venous and arterial thrombosis. We believe that the expected mechanism of action of SerpinPC renders this an unlikely risk, since the secondary APC pathways (signaling and anti-thrombotic) remain intact at clinical doses. We believe that the observed lack of D-dimer elevation in healthy volunteers and persons with hemophilia support this profile.
The vialed drug product is presented as a sterile lyophilized powder intended for intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection following reconstitution with water. Stability studies have shown the drug product to be stable at temperatures up to 40°C, and we expect a commercial product, if approved, will allow for ease of shipment and storage.
The product vision of SerpinPC is a one-size-fits-all treatment for hemophilia and potentially other bleeding disorders. Although our development plan will include both HA and HB subjects, the initial focus of our registration efforts will be HB, with and without inhibitors, given the higher unmet need and market opportunity in this patient population, who currently do not have alternatives to intravenous factor concentrate. The differentiated mechanism of action of SerpinPC is designed to enable an advantage over other rebalancing approaches under development, including fitusuran and concizumab. The hemophilia community, including persons with hemophilia, their physicians and caregivers, is risk averse given the devastation caused by HIV and hepatitis C transmission with plasma derived products. We believe that the trade-off of increased convenience or improved efficacy should not come at the cost of increased risk of serious adverse events such as thrombosis.
Clinical Data
Completed Trials
 We announced positive topline results from the Phase 2a part of AP-0101, the six-month repeat dose portion of the ongoing open-label clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous doses of SerpinPC in male persons with severe HA and HB who were not on prophylaxis. Reduction in bleeding was an exploratory outcome.
The Phase 1 portion of this study was conducted in two parts, with Part 1a in healthy volunteers in a clinical trial unit in the U.K. In this part, four cohorts of healthy subjects received increasing doses of SerpinPC by IV infusion and one by subcutaneous injection. Part 1b was conducted in established clinical trial units embedded in university hospitals in Moldova and Georgia with access to the target patient population of persons with hemophilia receiving only on-demand factor concentrates. The SAD study switched to persons with hemophilia at a dose at which biological effects might be expected, 0.1mg/kg to 1.2mg/kg by subcutaneous injection in four cohorts of three subjects each.
All doses in Part 1 were well-tolerated without incident or SerpinPC-related adverse events, including injection site reactions. Administration of SerpinPC did not lead to increases in D-dimer, TNF or IL-6 at any dose.
All subjects in Part 1b had severe hemophilia and received factor concentrate on demand before and during the study. All patients had target joints (range 1 to 4, median 2.5). ABR was calculated for each subject from prospective observation prior to exposure to SerpinPC. The median ABR was 35 (range 26 to 41). In the eight weeks following a single subcutaneous injection of SerpinPC there was a 55% reduction in all bleeding and a 72% reduction in spontaneous joint and muscle bleeding. Five subjects experienced zero spontaneous bleeds for two months after receiving their single dose. In total 97 bleeds occurred in the pre-exposure observation period and 29 in the 8 weeks following exposure. All 29 bleeds following SerpinPC administration were treated with factor concentrate on-demand as per standard of care without incident and without elevation in D-dimer levels. No anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were detected in Part 1.
All subjects who participated in Part 1b of the Phase 1 study chose to enroll in the Phase 2a study. The design of the Phase 2a study is summarized in the graphic below.
Figure 13: Schematic representation of the Phase 2a AP-0101 trial design.
In total, 23 subjects enrolled in the Phase 2a. One subject with a history of a skin disorder was discontinued because of an injection site reaction. SerpinPC was well-tolerated. No other SerpinPC-related AEs have been recorded. There was no reported sustained elevation in D-dimer throughout the 24-week study. Two subjects had anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and remained on treatment without apparent impact on ABRs. 
In the highest dose cohort, SerpinPC reduced the self-reported all bleeds ABR by 88% (from 36.0 median all bleed ABR to 4.4) during the last 12 weeks of treatment (pre-specified primary assessment period) as compared to the all bleeds ABR prospectively measured during the pre-exposure observation period. In the highest dose cohort, five out of eight subjects had zero or one bleed during the 12-week pre-specified primary assessment period. Self-reported spontaneous joint bleeds ABR was reduced by 94% in the highest dose cohort (from 21.1 median spontaneous joint bleeds 
ABR to 2.2). ABR reductions were similar between patients with either HA or HB. The graphs and table below show the reduction in ABR and median target joints at all three dose levels. 
Figure 14: Change in ABR in the Phase 2a portion of AP-0101.
Figure 15: Change in ABR for persons with HA and persons with HB in the Phase 2a portion of AP-0101.
The median number of target joints (joint with >3 bleeds in any 6-month period) was reduced to zero at the end of the study from a pre-exposure baseline of 2.5. All subjects had target joints at the start of the study and 15 subjects had zero target joints at the end of the study. The graph below shows the reduction in the number of target joints.
Figure 16: Number of target joints at the start and end of the treatment period in the Phase 2a portion of AP-0101.
We believe that the observed PK of SerpinPC could support a monthly dosing interval. Following five months of SC dosing once every four weeks, accumulation ratios for Cmax suggest no to minimal accumulation following this dosing regimen.
Ongoing Trials and Development Plan
All 22 subjects who completed the Phase 2a portion of AP-0101 have elected to enroll into the 48-week open label extension (“OLE”) portion of the study in which a single flat 60 mg subcutaneous dose of SerpinPC will be administered every 4 weeks over a period of 48 weeks (13 doses total). One subject has discontinued due to emigration. Following this OLE study, subjects will be offered participation in a higher dose OLE study in which a 1.2 mg/kg subcutaneous dose of SerpinPC will be administered every 2 weeks over a period of 24 weeks. We expect to report data from the 48 week flat dose OLE study and interim results from the following 24 week high dose OLE study in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
We are preparing for our first registrational study for HB in 2022. The design of this study, AP-0102, is summarized in the diagram below. The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic SerpinPC in subjects with severe HB without inhibitors. In addition to HB subjects, the study will also enroll subjects with severe HA, with and without inhibitors, to add to the safety database. The study will have three parts: a 24-week randomized dose-justification part (Part 1) with approximately 60 subjects, a 24-week expansion part (Part 2) with approximately 60 further subjects at the dose selected from Part 1 based on an interim analysis, and a further 24-week extension part (Part 3) for subjects who complete either Part 1 or Part 2.
Figure 17: Schematic representation of the registrational AP-0102 trial design.
A separate registrational study is planned with fewer than 20 subjects to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SerpinPC in subjects with severe HB with inhibitors. Subjects in this study will receive SerpinPC 1.2 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 48 weeks.
Our intention is to develop a data package over the next several years to position SerpinPC as the next transformative therapy in hemophilia, if approved. The primary focus of our ongoing development plan is HB, with and without inhibitors. We believe the higher unmet need and market opportunity in this patient population, who currently do not have alternatives to intravenous factor concentrate, presents a compelling opportunity for SerpinPC, if approved, to potentially provide a convenient subcutaneous treatment option for persons with HB. Additional registrational plans for HA are in progress.
Product Exclusivity
We currently benefit from exclusivity of SerpinPC through a variety of means, including patent protection and through the exclusive license of rights under our agreement with the University of Cambridge. See “—Intellectual Property and License Agreements.” In addition, we intend to apply for orphan drug designation for SerpinPC with the EMA and may apply for Breakthrough Therapy Designation with the FDA.
Emerging Programs
LB101 and LB201 in Solid Tumors
Summary
We aim to develop novel therapeutics based on our unique platform technology, which is designed to selectively drive potent effector function activity, such as CD47 or CD3, while avoiding systemic toxicity. The lead compound is LB101, a PD-L1xCD47 LockBody®, which has two anti-CD-47 domains blocked by two anti-PD-L1 domains, with proprietary human IgG-derived hinges linking the anti-CD47 and anti-PD-L1 domains. The cell-killing mechanism of action, in this case CD47, is blocked by the PD-L1 tumor targeting domain until the proprietary human IgG-derived hinges are naturally degraded in the TME, thus unlocking and activating the CD47 effector function activity in the tumor. The targeting domain, such as PD-L1, may have antitumor function itself in addition to the effector function. We are currently conducting preclinical evaluation, cell line development and IND-enabling studies for LB101. We expect to share preclinical data on LB101 at ASCO 2022 and plan to submit an IND to the FDA in late 2022. 
We are also developing LB201, a PD-L1xCD3 LockBody®. The cell-killing mechanism of action, in this case CD3, is blocked by the PD-L1 tumor targeting domain until the proprietary human IgG-derived hinges are naturally degraded in the TME, gradually unlocking CD3 effector function activity and activating potent CD3 recruitment and T cell mediated killing in the tumor. We plan to submit an IND to the FDA for LB201 in 2023. The LockBody® programs are from our subsidiary LockBody Therapeutics Ltd (LockBody). 
Disease Overview
According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the World Health Organization (WHO), the global solid tumor burden has increased to an estimated 19 million new cases and up to ten million deaths per year. According to the American Cancer Society, in the U.S. alone, there are an estimated 1.9 million new cases and over 600,000 solid tumor deaths annually.
Tumors are sometimes described as being “hot,” meaning that they have been infiltrated by the body’s T-cells, a part of the body’s immune system. For this reason, hot tumors typically respond to immunotherapy treatment using checkpoint inhibitors to mobilize the T-cells’ response to kill tumor cells. In contrast, “cold” tumors have not been infiltrated with T-cells and, as a result, immunotherapy drugs often have limited effect on these tumors.
Competition and Market Opportunity
While major improvements in understanding the biology of cancer and its treatment have been made in the past decades, there remains a significant unmet medical need for a large number of cancer patients across many different types of cancers. The advent of immunotherapies has been a significant advance in cancer treatment; however, modern immunotherapies, including the checkpoint inhibitors which target the PD1/PD-L1 pathway, are only effective in a minority of patients. 
Currently approved checkpoint inhibitors are mostly active in the minority of “hot” tumors. The majority of solid tumors, however, are “cold”, where no clear underlying immune response to the tumor exists. While a large body of evidence supports the potential of other immunotherapeutic approaches such as targeting CD47 in the treatment of many cancer types, actual clinical success has been very limited in part because of the narrow therapeutic index of available investigational agents. LB101 and subsequent compounds leveraging the same technology are specifically designed to address this gap. 
We are aware of several programs under development as potential treatments for solid tumors, including those which utilize CD47 with or without PD-L1 to target tumor cells. These include Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead), developing CD47 IgG combinations; Alx Oncology Holdings (ALX Oncology), developing SIRP receptor-Fc fusion + IgG combinations; Light Chain Bioscience, developing CD47 bispecific antibodies; Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent), developing a PD-L1xCD47 bispecific; and Pfizer, developing a PD-L1xCD47 bispecific.
We are also aware of programs under development, including those which utilize CD3 with or without PD-L1 to target tumor cells. These include Harpoon Therapeutics, Inc. (Harpoon), developing activatable CD3 bispecifics; Takeda (Maverick Therapeutics), developing activatable CD3 bispecifics; Sanofi (Amunix), developing activatable CD3 bispecifics; and CytomX Therapeutics, Inc. (CytomX), developing activatable CD3 bispecifics. 
Our Product Candidates
LB101, PD-L1xCD47 LockBody®
Many potential drug targets have been described that are hypothetically addressable via antibodies, but very few are exclusively expressed in diseased tissue. As a result, engagement of the target in non-diseased tissue often causes unwanted side effects. This off-tumor target expression often also leads to antigen ‘sink’ effects where large doses of the antibody must be given to ensure sufficient antibody penetrates the tumor to have a therapeutic effect. One such example is the class of antibodies that target the antigen CD47. The therapeutic potential of this target, coupled with the frustrating realities surrounding its pharmacology, inspired the development of our platform of LockBody® programs.
The platform was designed based on the principal of ‘radical simplicity.’ This holistic approach to molecular design led to the creation of a reproducible format that exhibits simple IgG-like expression and purification, high stability and solubility. This overcomes the severe reproducibility issues that are frequently observed for more complex molecular formats.
Historically, the use of CD47 binding agents to target solid tumors has been limited by certain intrinsic challenges. Such challenges include a “sink” effect produced by high expression of CD47 in the bloodstream and solid tissues in the body that may necessitate the administration of frequent, large initial doses to achieve therapeutic efficacy. In addition, the binding of blood cells by anti-CD47 also presents a significant toxicity risk, which precludes the use of strongly pro-phagocytic antibody isotopes. As a result, CD47 agents commonly exhibit modest monotherapy activity and require the addition of further pro-phagocytic therapies. Finally, the tumor is typically a ‘hostile’ environment with high expression rates of proteolytic enzymes such as MMPs and Cathepsins which can directly accelerate IgG degradation. These factors collectively limit the clinical potential of anti-CD47 antibodies and many other types of anti-tumor target antibodies where target expression is not limited solely to the tumor environment. LB101 is designed to address these issues directly by bypassing the CD47 sink, minimizing peripheral toxicity and driving maximal CD47 blocking activity into the tumor.
Figure 18: The intrinsic challenges of using CD47 binding agents (antibodies and receptor-Fc fusions) 
and how they are intended to be addressed by LB101
We believe agents that antagonize CD47 signaling by tumor cells hold great promise as potential therapies to treat both hot and cold tumors. CD47 is now an elucidated IO target in humans, but so far this promise has only been realized in blood cancers. Importantly, CD47 is broadly over-expressed and associated with poorer survival outcomes in many key solid tumor indications such as breast, NSCLC, colorectal, gastric, hepatic, renal and HNSCC cancers. These indications make up the majority of all solid tumor cases. CD47 upregulation in the tumor environment acts as a powerful checkpoint inhibitor which inhibits the potential tumor cell-killing functions of myeloid cells and NK cells. As such it is often known as the ‘Don’t eat me’ signal. Therapies which effectively block this signal while also adding a powerful ‘Eat me signal’ have the potential to stimulate potent and durable immune responses against solid tumors.
Figure 19: LB101 (PD-L1xCD47) design principles for LB101.
As illustrated in the figure above, a poorly tolerated mechanism of action such as CD47 is locked behind a well-tolerated tumor targeting domain such as PD-L1. In the example above, PD-L1 domains direct enrichment in PD-L1+ solid tumors. When locked, as on the left, CD47 binding is fully blocked and LB101 has the systemic tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of a standard PD-L1 IgG1. Between the two anti-PD-L1 domains and the anti-CD47 domains are two unique, human IgG-derived, ‘lower hinge’ linker sequences which are highly structured in solution. These hinge linkers block CD47 interaction in the periphery by full steric inhibition of the CD47 binding site. Critically, the lower hinge linker design is based on the observation that these precise sequences undergo natural degradation in the TME, thereby exposing the inner binding domains and activating CD47 blockade to induce antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). In the PD-L1+ TME, LB101 is first unlocked by MMP and/or Cathepsin proteolysis (accelerated at pH < 7.0), thereby allowing potent CD47 blockade and potent innate immune cell induction. A second unlocking will also occur for this compound, releasing the PD-L1 targeting and potentially leading to a ‘super-activated’ state in which the CD47 function is free to drive anti-tumor effect on tumor cells that are CD47+ regardless of their level of PD-L1 expression. The modular nature of the construction platform delivers endless optionality, where both TAA specificity and/or locked effector function can be changed at will by modifying the antibody variable domains.
We reasoned that an optimal single agent would combine PD-L1 targeting, potent CD47 blockade and would have a fully functional IgG1 Fc region, as illustrated in the figure below. In cancers, CD47/SIRPα and PD-L1/PD1 can act in concert to inhibit the ADCC, ADCP, inflammatory and antigen presenting functions of innate immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, monocytes and NK cells. As a result, high CD47 expression limits tumor visibility to the adaptive immune system and minimizes T-cell education. We believe this combination of capacities has the potential to drive potent direct tumor cell killing by innate immune cells, maximal antigen presentation and education of the adaptive immune system, and strong pro-inflammatory signaling to recruit further immune cell infiltration and attack on the solid tumor mass.
Figure 20: The technology for LB101 is designed to combine 
optimal factors for CD47 targeting into a single agent
LB101 is also designed to ameliorate a further critical limitation on the function of classical low-effector CD47 antibodies. To be fully effective, the low effector function, such as IgG4, CD47 blocking agent and high effector function IgG1 must be co-located on the same tumor cell surface at sufficient density to both effectively block CD47 and present enough human IgG1 Fc to drive potent activity. We believe that sinks, biodistribution limitations in the solid tumor environment, the complex pharmacology of having two agents with radically differing pharmacokinetics, different dosing schedules and cumulative toxicities all make this very difficult to achieve in practice. Our technology, in contrast, is designed to enrich all functions on the same cell surface.
Figure 21: LB101 ameliorates ‘the colocation conundrum’
LB201, PD-L1xCD3 LockBody®
Having created the CD47 LockBody®, we recognized that this same principle could be productively applied to CD3 ligating tumor targeting agents. Bispecific antibodies that bind to a TAA and recruit killer T cells via a constitutively active CD3 binding arm have also been used successfully in hematological cancers, leading to the approved product blinatumomab. Similar to CD47 agents however, they suffer from poor biodistribution (TAA sink, plus large secondary lymphoid CD3+ cell sink), toxicity driven by on target/off tumor activity and/or on tumor activity, coupled with excessive potency (cytokine storm). These factors have resulted in a paucity of positive outcomes in solid tumor clinical trials. To address all of these issues in a single agent, we have extended the initial design principle to create a ‘single-arm’ version in LB201, with CD3 as the locked mechanism of action.
Figure 22: LB201 (PD-L1xCD3) design principles.
As illustrated in the figure above, CD3 is locked behind a well-tolerated targeting domain, with an effector null Fc domain, in a ‘single-arm’ format. (A) When locked, LB201 can bind TAA+ non-cancer cells but does not engage CD3. (B) In the tumor microenvironment, LB201 is gradually unlocked by MMP and/or Cathepsin proteolysis, thereby allowing potent CD3 recruitment and potent T cell mediated killing. (C) LB201 then progressively becomes de-activated, minimizing risk of activated CD3 escaping into the non-diseased tissue.
Preclinical Data using a Her2xCD47 construct to demonstrate the LockBody® mechanism
In vitro data
Having initially observed that LockBody® Her2xCD47 molecules were well expressed, soluble, stable and had mAb-like development characteristics, we demonstrated that the in vitro function of the purified proteins supported the hypotheses outlined above.
Target interaction measurements
Purified Her2xCD47 LockBody® was tested in locked and unlocked (activated using MMP12) forms using high-sensitivity Biacore technology. In this analysis, the locked form exhibited no measurable binding to CD47 protein, while the unlocked form demonstrated clear, high-affinity, concentration-dependent binding.
Figure 23: Her2xCD47 LockBody® applied in Biacore in both locked and unlocked states were analyzed for the ability to bind human CD47 at concentrations ranging from 25 up to 400nM.
Her2xCD47 LockBody® was also tested extensively in binding to CD47+, Her2- cells such as erythrocytes. These analyses demonstrated that neither the locked molecule nor Trastuzumab has ability to drive hemagglutination and neither agent shows measurable binding signal for erythrocytes in flow cytometry. Importantly, however, the IgG1 version of the CD47 antibody used in the LockBody® exhibited strong erythrocyte binding.
Potency in locked and unlocked states
Her2xCD47 LockBody® has been tested in phagocytosis of Her2hi/CD47hi (BT474) and Her2low/CD47hi (MCF-7) cells by primary human macrophages. These analyses demonstrated that the locked Her2xCD47 LockBody® and Trastuzumab are functionally equivalent, driving only weak phagocytosis of BT474 and none for MCF-7. The unlocked Her2xCD47 LockBody® drove potent, concentration-dependent phagocytosis that was equivalent to CD47 IgG4 on MCF-7 cells and significantly more potent on BT474.
Figure 24: Primary human macrophage phagocytosis of BT474 and MCF-7 cells by 
Her2xCD47 locked and unlocked LockBodies, CD47 IgG4, Herceptin and IgG1 Isotype.
In vivo data
As in vitro analyses had suggested that the Her2xCD47 LockBody® was stable, soluble and lacked binding to CD47+ cells in its locked form, we performed in vivo pharmacokinetic and tolerability studies in mice (note: the CD47 antibody in the LockBody® is human/cyno/mouse cross-reactive and binds mouse erythrocytes strongly). To perform this study, we chose transgenic ‘TG32’ mice from Jackson laboratories (which express human FcRn) as these mice are associated with PK behavior for human antibodies that is more predictive of what happens in man than wild type mice. As the presence of human FcRn leads to lengthened exposure for human antibodies in the mouse, we reasoned that if the LockBody® was unstable in vivo (in either plasma or tissue), it would A) cause hematological toxicity signals associated with CD47 antibodies such as anemia, and B) exhibit rapid clearance, which is also associated with CD47 antibodies. The Her2xCD47 LockBody® and CD47 IgG1 (containing the same CD47 binding domain sequences as found in the LockBody®) were dosed at 2 and 10 mg/kg. The 10 mg/kg dose of the CD47 IgG1 was not tolerated, while 2 mg/kg dose was tolerated but exhibited extremely rapid target-mediated clearance. The LockBody® 10 mg/kg dose was generally well tolerated, as was the 2 mg/kg dose and both doses generated long, linear distribution with no evidence of target-mediated clearance. This led to a dramatic improvement in potential area under the curve (AUC) for LockBody® over the CD47 IgG1. None of the tolerated doses led to significant drops in hemoglobin values, but the 2mg/kg dose of CD47 IgG1 did exhibit classical erythrocyte clearance indicators, such as elevated reticulocyte levels. These data demonstrated that the Her2xCD47 LockBody® was generally well tolerated and stable in vivo, with antibody-like PK.

 hemoglobin levels (C) and day 5 reticulocyte levels (D) for Her2xCD47 LockBody®
 at 2 and 10 mg/kg, and CD47 IgG1 at 2 mg/kg (10mg/kg dose not tolerated).
As PK and single-dose tolerability studies had been successful for Her2xCD47 LockBody®, initial pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses were performed in NOD-SCID mice bearing established xenograft tumors generated from gastric cancer cell lines known to express both Her2 and CD47 targets. After 4 doses of vehicle, Trastuzumab or Her2xCD47 LockBody®, again, no tolerability issues were observed, and mice did not develop anemia in any dosing group. Tumor samples were taken and used to perform immunohistochemistry analyses examining immune infiltrates. The quantification of immune cell types demonstrated that the Her2xCD47 LockBody® could induce increased total CD45+ leukocyte infiltration and increased CD11b+ inflammatory myeloid cell infiltration, when compared to both vehicle and Trastuzumab. Importantly, no increases were observed for CD206+ anti-inflammatory ‘M2’ type macrophage. This data demonstrated that the Her2xCD47 LockBody® was generally well tolerated and stable in vivo, over multiple doses, but drove pro-inflammatory infiltration effects that were not observed for Trastuzumab when dosed head-to-head at equimolar concentrations. We believe this is evidence that the LockBody® protein remains locked in the periphery but becomes unlocked in the tumor environment.

Development Plan
We are currently conducting IND-enabling activities for LB101. We expect to share foundational preclinical data at ASCO 2022 evaluating the activity and tolerability of LB101 monotherapy in a hPD-L1+ syngeneic model in mice, in comparison with atezolizumab. We plan to submit an IND for LB101 in late 2022. LB201 is currently in preclinical development, and we plan to submit an IND for LB201 in 2023.
ZF874 in AATD
Summary
We are developing ZF874, a small molecule pharmacological chaperone folding corrector of Z-A1AT for patients with AATD. ZF874 is from our subsidiary Z Factor Limited (Z Factor). Z Factor was formed based on the hypothesis that molecules that could bind into a version of the Z-Pocket found in the last folding intermediate, the one stalled by the Z mutation, would accelerate the final folding step to the native state, thus rescuing folding and secretion. This crystal structure was licensed into Z Factor in 2015 and remains our exclusive know-how. The proprietary structural insight into the misfolding of Z-A1AT allows our team to continue exploring the potential of compounds across multiple chemical families. In addition to the clinical lead of ZF874, we are advancing ZF887, which originates from a different chemical family than that of ZF874.
Disease Overview
A1AT, also known as alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor and SerpinA1, is a protease inhibitor belonging to the serpin family. It is produced in the liver and circulates in its native state in human blood at approximately 1.5 g/L. Its main role is to protect tissue from proteases released by neutrophils, such as human neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and proteinase 3. A1AT inhibits proteases utilizing the well-characterized ‘mousetrap’ mechanism of protease inhibition.
AATD is an autosomal recessive disorder most frequently caused by missense mutations in the A1AT gene that lead to misfolding, and therefore reduced secretion of native A1AT into the circulation. Over 100 mutations have been described that lead to deficiency of A1AT, the most common of which is the ‘Z’ mutation, with 1 in 25 individuals of European descent carriers (PiMZ), and 1 in 1,800 homozygous. Individuals homozygous for the Z mutation (PiZZ) have A1AT levels 10–15% of normal and account for 95% of the known cases of AATD. Although classified as a rare disease, AATD is one of the most common rare diseases, with incidence similar to cystic fibrosis. AATD remains highly underdiagnosed, but it is estimated that there are over 200,000 PiZZ individuals in the US and Europe. PiSZ individuals (S denotes a milder deficiency mutation) are also at increased risk of COPD, and there are estimated to be 1.2 million PiSZ individuals worldwide. Market expansion into PiMZ, of which there are an estimated 42.4 million individuals, is possible in the large subset of the general COPD and NASH populations, where the PiMZ genotype is highly over-represented.
The small fraction of Z-A1AT that is secreted is in the native conformation, has a half-life in blood indistinguishable from the wild-type protein (M-A1AT) and is functional as a protease inhibitor, with similar inhibitory activity against the target proteases. However, the low plasma concentration is insufficient to protect the lungs from proteolytic degradation. PiZZ individuals who smoke develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as early adults, and non-smokers are also at high risk for developing COPD in their thirties and forties. The penetrance of COPD in the PiZZ population is estimated to be 80%, with 50–72% eventually dying of respiratory failure. Carriers of the Z variant are also at increased risk of COPD, with an odds ratio (OR) of 5 for never smokers and 11 for smokers.
AATD can also manifest as liver disease. 10% of PiZZ newborns develop cholestatic hepatitis, a quarter of whom will suffer acute liver failure and require an emergency transplant. The liver manifestation of AATD is bimodal, with about half of PiZZ individuals exhibiting some liver function abnormality in infancy that usually resolves, followed by increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma from mid-life. Approximately one-third of PiZZ carriers have cirrhosis at the time of death, and about 10% of the PiZZ population die of liver failure. The OR for developing liver cancer is 20 for the PiZZ population. The liver disease manifestations of AATD are only found associated with the presence of the Z mutation, and are considered to be a ‘gain-of-function’ disorder, in contrast to COPD which is simply caused by the lack of circulating anti-protease activity. This has been explained by the accumulation of ‘polymers’ of Z-A1AT in the ER of hepatocytes, although why this is toxic to the liver remains unclear.
In the typical PiZZ patient, a two-fold improvement in Z-A1AT secretion from 0.27 to 0.55 g/l is likely to provide clinical benefit since 0.55 g/L (11 µM) is considered sufficient to offer protection from lung disease.
Competition and Market Opportunity
There is currently no approved therapy to counter directly either the lung or liver disease manifestations of AATD. Augmentation therapy, such as PROLASTIN-C®, marketed by Grifols, S.A. (Grifols), consists of weekly IV infusions of plasma-derived A1AT and is available in some countries for patients with established COPD, based on increased A1AT levels above 11 µM. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not recommend its use in the United Kingdom due to unclear clinical benefit and a cost of £100,000 per patient year. It is not approved anywhere as a prophylactic to prevent development of COPD in PiZZ individuals, and it has no impact on the liver. Lung and/or liver transplantation are the only other available treatment options, besides the normal management of the disease manifestations of AATD.
Next generation augmentation therapies are currently under development for lung manifestations of AATD, including INBRX-101, being investigated by Inhibrx, Inc. (Inhibrx) in Phase 1 clinical development. Alternative approaches for lung manifestations of AATD includes alvelestat, an oral neutrophil elastase inhibitor being investigated by Mereo BioPharma Group plc (Mereo BioPharma) in Phase 2 clinical development. Several alpha-1-antiproteinase RNAi therapeutics are also being pursued to address liver manifestations of AATD, including ARO-AAT being investigated by Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Arrowhead) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) in Phase 3 clinical development and belcesiran being investigated by Novo Nordisk (Dicerna) in Phase 2 clinical development. BioMarin is investigating BMN 349, a molecular chaperone to understand if it impacts folding of zA1AT, currently in preclinical development. There are also other small molecule folding corrector approaches being investigated by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Vertex), currently in preclinical development after Vertex announced its lead molecule in Phase 2, VX-864, would not advance. In addition to these programs, gene / RNA editing approaches are being investigated by multiple companies in preclinical development. 
We believe that if approved, ZF874 has the potential to address underlying disease pathology with the ability to treat both liver and lung manifestations of AATD. 
Our Product Candidate
We are developing ZF874 as a disease-modifying treatment candidate for AATD caused by the common Z mutation. Based on the proprietary crystal structure of Z-A1AT, in silico screening was conducted to find compounds that bind to the Z-Pocket. 414 in silico hits were tested for improved secretion of human Z-A1AT from transfected cells. From that screen, 117 of the 414 in silico hits (28%) were positive in this in vitro assay at 300 nM, suggesting an enrichment over a random compound screen. The large number of active chemical entities allowed us to prioritize molecules believed to possess excellent drug properties. ZF874 is the result of medicinal chemistry conducted on a lead compound identified from the in silico screen, guided by structure-activity relationship principles (in vitro activity, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME), and oral PK properties, safety indicators and in vivo activity). 
ZF874 has a low molecular weight, high aqueous solubility, high oral availability, low plasma protein binding, PK properties suitable for daily oral dosing, and is renally excreted. ZF874 is a potent and specific folding corrector for Z-A1AT, improving secretion from transfected cells. ZF874 acts catalytically, with no observable binding to native Z-A1AT. ZF874 is a very stable molecule with a process that is amenable to scaling to support current clinical and future commercial needs. Preclinical data showed increased blood levels of Z-A1AT and clearance of Z-A1AT polymer from liver in mice over-expressing human Z-A1AT at lower doses than in human studies. 
We are currently conducting the Phase 1 Part B ZF-0101 study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ZF874 in PiXZ subjects. Increase in serum A1AT levels is an exploratory outcome. Initial data from the first three subjects dosed in the study is the first demonstration that a pharmacological chaperone can provide sufficient functional Z-A1AT increases in serum to potentially achieve greater than 11 micromolar levels in individuals with the PiZZ genotype.
Clinical Data
Ongoing Trials and Development Plan
We are currently conducting a Phase 1 study (designated ZF-0101), comprised of a SAD in healthy volunteers (Part A) and repeat dosing study for at least 28 days in PiXZ subjects (Part B). ZF874 is formulated as powder in bottle, and all doses are administered as drinks. In the completed Part A study, seven cohorts of healthy volunteers were successfully dosed up to 50 mg/kg fasted. All doses were well-tolerated, except for a transient apparent Cmax effect at 50 
mg/kg in the fasted state, similar to what was observed in the dog at doses above 100 mg/kg. 50 mg/kg was well-tolerated when given as 25 mg/kg bid (12 hour interval). PK was consistent with expectations, with good oral availability and a ~4 hour half-life. 
The Part B study is a repeat dosing study for at least 28 days in PiXZ subjects and will enroll multiple cohorts of up to 5 PiXZ subjects each. Cohort 1 has completed, with two subjects receiving two daily doses of 15 mg/kg ZF874 and 1 subject receiving placebo. Since Cohort 1, we have undertaken a number of actions to accelerate enrollment and facilitate dose exploration in PiXZ subjects, including opening additional sites in the UK. Cohort 2 will receive two daily doses of 2.5 mg/kg ZF874. Dose selection for the following cohorts will be based on a comprehensive data review from the preceding cohort, including safety, tolerability, PK and change in serum A1AT levels. Pending the receipt of satisfactory long-term animal toxicology data, the protocol may be amended to extend the duration of dosing. Safety, tolerability and PK are primary endpoints. Increase in serum A1AT levels is an exploratory outcome. 
Initial data from the first three subjects dosed in the Part B study (Cohort 1) is the first demonstration that a pharmacological chaperone can provide sufficient functional Z-A1AT increases in serum to potentially achieve greater than 11 micromolar levels in individuals with the PiZZ genotype. In both PiMZ subjects dosed with 15 mg/kg BID of ZF874, the observed increase in functional A1AT was between 3.5 and 6 micromolar for these subjects with one Z‐gene copy. The A1AT levels began to increase rapidly in the last week of dosing. After only 28 days of dosing the amount of A1AT was similar to achieving 12 to 17 micromolar in individuals with two Z‐ gene copies (PiZZ). In pre‐clinical PiZ mouse models treated with ZF874, A1AT continues to rise with dosing beyond 28 days. A1AT plasma levels of 11 micromolar have been the basis for approval of the existing A1AT augmentation therapies. A1AT levels in the placebo‐treated subject were not observed to change significantly. Consistent with a pharmacological effect for ZF874, and as expected based on the circulating half‐life of A1AT, levels returned to baseline by 28 days after completion of dosing. The demographics and change in A1AT functional activity for the three PiMZ subjects is shown in the below figure. 
Figure 27: Functional A1AT levels in PiMZ subjects in the Phase 1 Part B portion of ZF-0101.
Pharmacokinetic analysis showed a two‐fold higher exposure to ZF874 in one subject. This subject showed a two‐fold higher increase in functional A1AT as well as a delayed, reversible increase in ALT (8x ULN) and AST (3.5x ULN). All other liver function tests including bilirubin, GGT, and ALP remained in the normal range. All other adverse events reported in the Study were classified as mild. Due to enrollment challenges at the single clinical site, and following the observation of elevated liver enzymes in one Study participant, we elected to unblind the Study prior to completing Part B enrollment. The change in ALT for the three PiMZ subjects is shown in the below graph. 
Figure 28: ALT levels in PiMZ subjects in the Phase 1 Part B portion of ZF-0101.
We have amended the protocol for the Part B study as described above to accelerate enrollment and facilitate dose exploration in PiXZ subjects, including opening additional clinical sites. We expect to report additional data from multiple dose cohorts, which include both PiZZ and PiMZ subjects, in the second half of 2022. We plan to initiate a global Phase 2 study, including a 6-month continuous dosing portion with paired liver biopsy, contingent on completion of our ongoing dose justification work in Phase 1. 
Our ongoing development plan is aimed at generating data on our small molecule pharmacological chaperone folding correctors of Z-A1AT to address the unmet need of patients with liver and lung manifestations of AATD. 
Product Exclusivity
We intend to protect exclusivity of ZF874 and other compounds across multiple chemical families principally through patent protection and the exclusive license of rights under our agreement with the University of Cambridge. See “—Intellectual Property and License Agreements.”
MGX292 in PAH
Summary
We are developing MGX292, a disease-modifying, protein-engineered variant of human bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), for the treatment of PAH. PAH, a severe form of pulmonary hypertension, is a progressive life-limiting disease caused by narrowing of small pulmonary arteries in the periphery of the lung. MGX292 is currently in preclinical development, in the IND-enabling stage. We plan to submit an IND to the FDA in early 2023 to commence a clinical program for this product candidate. MGX292 is from our subsidiary Morphogen-IX Limited (Morphogen-IX).
Disease Overview
PAH is a rare disease with a major unmet medical need. Patients initially present with progressive breathlessness on exertion caused by severely elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation, leading to death from right-sided heart failure. Females are more commonly affected than males, and the disease can manifest at any age, though we estimate to be typically in the 20-60 age group. PAH can occur spontaneously, which is termed idiopathic PAH, in approximately 50% of cases, or in association with other underlying conditions, such as congenital heart disease, connective tissue disease and liver disease. Together, these conditions comprise WHO Group 1 PAH, for which existing drugs are approved.
PAH has a prevalence of 11 to 26 per million individuals, affecting approximately 70,000 patients in North America, Europe and Japan. Although many factors, including altered growth factor signaling, inflammation and metabolism are features of PAH pathobiology, it remains uncertain to what extent these factors are causal as opposed to secondary manifestations, as most previous attempts to target these pathways with therapeutics have been unsuccessful in PAH patients. In contrast, genetic evidence for the causality of PAH provides a strong basis for drug discovery efforts. The genetic evidence in PAH emerges from patients with a family history of disease and from patients with idiopathic PAH. 75% percent of patients with a family history of PAH have heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein type 2 receptor (BMPR2). Mutations in BMPR2 are found in 15% to 40% of patients with idiopathic PAH. Since the discovery of BMPR2 mutations in 2000, further causal mutations in components of the BMPR2 pathway have been discovered in PAH patients. Mutations in BMPR2 confer an increased risk of developing PAH of approximately 100,000-fold.
This genetic evidence indicates a central causal pathway in PAH defined by the circulating BMP ligand, BMP9, derived from the liver that engages a receptor complex comprising ALK1 and BMPR2 on pulmonary endothelial cells. The highest levels of expression of ALK1 and BMPR2 are found in lung endothelial cells. Thus, loss of BMP9 signaling selectively confers susceptibility to PAH without compromising other vascular beds or organ systems. Approximately a quarter of idiopathic PAH patients have loss-of-function mutations in the BMP9 signaling axis. This may occur from a reduction in ligand or in receptor expression (depicted by the red arrows in the image below). The normal pulmonary circulation is protected and maintained when this signaling pathway is intact. Loss of function leads to pulmonary vascular cell dysfunction, with increased permeability of the endothelium and increased apoptosis of endothelial cells, and the formation of plexiform lesions. The endothelial dysfunction promotes expansion of the underlying smooth muscle cells leading to constrictive vascular lesions. The image shows endothelial cells stained in red and the proliferation of surrounding smooth muscle cells stained with green from a patient with PAH.
Figure 29: Central causal pathway in PAH. 
Furthermore, patients with portopulmonary hypertension, which is PAH in the presence of cirrhosis, exhibit markedly reduced levels of plasma BMP9 that predicts the development of PAH. Taken together, these discoveries provide strong target validation for approaches that enhance BMP9/BMPR2/ALK1 signaling as a novel therapeutic approach for PAH.
An important observation is that dysfunction of the BMP9/BMPR2/ALK1 pathway is not confined to patients with genetic forms of PAH. Patients with various forms of Group 1 PAH have been shown to exhibit a deficiency of this pathway, whether it be reduced expression of the BMPR2 receptor, or reduced circulating levels of BMP9. In addition, the 
widely used animal models of PAH are characterized by reduced BMPR2 and BMP signaling in the lung. Thus, approaches to enhance activity of the BMP9 pathway are likely to be broadly applicable to Group 1 PAH, and potentially other WHO Groups, for which there are no approved treatments.
Competition and Market Opportunity
While approved drugs for PAH exist, current treatments do not impact the underlying pathophysiology of the disease and are not disease-modifying. The currently approved drugs to treat Group 1 PAH were largely developed to treat other cardiovascular conditions and have been repurposed for PAH. These drugs target vasoconstriction by either enhancing prostacyclin signaling prostaglandin I2 (IP receptor agonists), inhibiting the actions of endothelins (ERA antagonists), enhancing nitric oxide signaling (PDE5 inhibitors, guanylate cyclase activators) or a combination of these approaches. However, vasoconstriction is a small component of established human PAH and vasodilators fail to reverse the lung vascular pathology that characterizes PAH. Further, vasodilator therapies are often used in combination (two or three drug classes) but despite these options, the prognosis for PAH remains poor. According to U.S. and European registries the mortality rate at three years is approximately 40%. Alternative approaches that target the pulmonary vascular cell dysfunction leading to vascular remodeling have the potential to be truly disease modifying in PAH.
The total global market for PAH is estimated at $6.0 billion per annum based on sales of approved drugs. Although we are not aware of any competitors developing BMP-based agonists for PAH, Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) is currently investigating sotatercept in Phase 3 clinical development and Keros Therapeutics, Inc. (Keros) is currently investigating KER-012 in Phase 1 clinical development. Both are ligand trap-based investigational treatments for PAH, which are designed to inhibit signaling via the TGF-beta superfamily ligands, Activin, GDF8 and GDF11, but neither has been shown to enhance BMP9 signaling in animal models. 
Our Product Candidate
We are developing MGX292, a protein-engineered variant of BMP9, for the treatment of PAH. MGX292 is designed to overcome the functional deficiency in BMP9 signaling found in patients with PAH, restore vascular function and reverse established disease pathology in the pulmonary arterioles. We believe MGX292, if approved, has the potential for disease reversal/modification in patients with PAH, thereby potentially enhancing life expectancy and reducing symptoms. MGX292 is being developed initially as an intravenous formulation, and we are currently evaluating subcutaneous dosing. 
Figure 30. The rationale for BMP9-based therapies in PAH. Left panel: Circulating BMP9 and BMP10 signal via high affinity endothelial cell surface receptor complexes comprising ALK1 and BMPR-II with the co-receptor, endoglin. This continuous signaling mediates normal Smad1/5/8 activity to maintain endothelial cell homeostasis. Center panel: Genetic reduction of functional ALK1, BMP9, BMP10, BMPR-II, endoglin, Smad4 or Smad8, exacerbated by one or more “second hits”, critically reduces endothelial BMP9/BMP10 signaling and results in the pathological changes underlying the development of PAH. Right panel: Proposed mode of action of MGX292 (exogenous recombinant modified BMP9), leading to restored endothelial cell signaling via enhancement of BMPR-II protein levels and normalization of endothelial cell functions.
Despite the promise of BMP9 as a therapeutic in PAH, its potential for heterotopic ossification (HO), has traditionally been a major limitation. All BMPs are capable of driving a program of osteogenesis in mesenchymal tissues and native BMP9 also carries this risk. Native BMP9 signals at low concentrations via its high affinity type 1 receptor (ALK1), to preserve endothelial function. At higher concentrations, BMP9 can activate the low affinity type 1 receptor (ALK2), on mesenchymal cells. ALK2 is the archetypal receptor for driving bone formation and HO.
To unleash the full potential of BMP9 for PAH, we set out to develop protein engineered variants of native BMP9 that retain endothelial signaling via ALK1, but lack signaling via ALK2, which would otherwise lead to undesired bone formation. The design of single amino acid substitutions was based on a deep understanding of the structural basis of BMP signaling via type 1 and type 2 receptors. We screened a number of variants, and in 2019, ultimately selected MGX292 as its drug development candidate. Based on the design and supported by preclinical evidence, MGX292 is devoid of bone forming capacity while retaining the endothelial protection of the native protein. MGX292 has a molecular weight of approximately 90KDa and comprises a dimer of two growth factor domains and two prodomains, similar to the circulating form of native BMP9. In 2015, we showed in an article published in Nature Medicine that exogenous administration of native BMP9 could reverse established PAH in several rodent models of disease.
While PAH is the primary indication for MGX292, additional target disease indications with major unmet needs include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and hepatopulmonary syndrome, for which there are no approved therapies. The underlying biology of the BMP9 plays a causal role in HHT (heterozygous mutations in ALK1 or the accessory receptor ENG), hepatopulmonary syndrome (dramatically reduced 
levels of circulating BMP9) and ARDS (BMP9 levels reduced in patients with sepsis and BMP9 protects mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury).
Preclinical Data
In preclinical rat models of severe PAH, daily administration of MGX292 demonstrated a dose-dependent reversal of established lung vascular pathology. The Sugen-hypoxia protocol has become the most widely used rodent model of severe PAH because it more closely resembles human PAH, being a chronic model of severe disease leading to death from right heart failure. In addition, the lung pathology is characterized by the appearance of neointimal vascular lesions, which are an important feature in human PAH pathology, but not seen in most other rodent models. In human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, MGX292 has been observed in in vitro studies to activate downstream signaling in an ALK1 and BMPR2 dependent manner, with an EC50 similar to native BMP9.
In preclinical studies of the Sugen-hypoxia rat model, MGX292, given daily for four weeks, was observed to reverse established advanced pulmonary vascular remodeling at doses as low as 3-10µg/kg/day. Almost complete reversal of disease pathology is observed at 30µg/kg/day. MGX292 generally appears well-tolerated at the highest dose used to date, 270µg/kg/day for four weeks. The graph below shows that MGX292 reverses the number of neointimal lesions in the Sugen-hypoxia model, the lesion that characterizes human PAH pathology.
Figure 31: MGX292 reverses the number of neointimal lesions in the Sugen-hypoxia model,
 the lesion that characterizes human PAH pathology.
Development Plan
MGX292 is currently in preclinical development, in the IND-enabling stage. We expect to conduct a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in the second half of 2022 and to submit an IND in early 2023. In addition, while PAH is the primary indication for MGX292, we plan to explore opportunities in additional disease indications in which our technology may yield therapeutic benefit.
Oral and Intranasal OX2R Agonists for NT1
Summary
We are advancing an oral orexin agonist program for NT1, which we believe may offer improved tolerability and activity as compared to current therapies for NT1, as well as a novel orexin agonist approach for intranasal administration. Both programs are from our subsidiary Orexia Limited (Orexia). 
We believe that introduction of orexin agonists as novel therapeutics will represent a disruptive approach in the treatment of NT1 because orexin agonists, unlike any current marketed treatments, have the potential to directly address the underlying pathology of the disorder, which is the profound loss of orexinergic neurons. Our exclusive collaboration with Sosei Heptares, a leading biopharmaceutical drug discovery and development company with proprietary structure-based drug design (SBDD) technology for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) targets, in the orexin agonist area provides access to unique structural biology technology coupled with SBDD, currently applied to the identification and optimization of molecules towards clinical candidates. The therapeutic potential for orexin agonists extends beyond NT1 into other rare primary hypersomnia disorders such as NT2 and idiopathic hypersomnia, and into a broad range of other indications characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness.
Disease Overview
Narcolepsy is a lifelong, chronic neurologic disorder that affects the brain’s ability to regulate the normal sleep-wake cycle. Narcolepsy is a chronic rare and debilitating disorder that is estimated to affect over 150,000 people in the United States and over three million people worldwide. It is estimated that less than 50% of affected patients are diagnosed. Narcolepsy symptoms usually start between 7-25 years of age, and diagnostic delays of 8-12 years are common.
NT1 affects approximately 50% of all narcolepsy patients, and is characterized by a diverse set of symptoms that include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), sleep paralysis, hallucinations upon waking up or falling asleep, disturbed nighttime sleep, and cataplexy, a sudden transient loss of muscle tone usually triggered by strong emotions. Cataplexy events are characterized as ‘partial cataplexy’ which produce muscle weakness in particular areas of the body such as the face, neck, or limbs, or ‘complete cataplexy’ which results in a full body collapse. Even in the case of a full body collapse, the individual remains fully awake and aware of their surroundings but is unable to move. Cataplexy events usually resolve within several minutes, and the individual regains full control of their muscles. Impaired attention, vigilance, and ability to focus are also commonly reported as symptoms. For some individuals with NT1, related symptoms such as insomnia, weight gain, mood fluctuations and depression can have a significant debilitating impact on their lives. Narcolepsy can also occur without cataplexy which is referred to as NT2. The NT2 population is more heterogeneous than NT1 and is associated with partial loss of orexin in approximately 30% of individuals. Some individuals with NT2 progress over time to a diagnosis of NT1, with the onset of cataplexy and greater loss of orexin.
NT1 is caused by the profound loss of orexin-producing neurons. Orexin, also known as ‘hypocretin’, is a key regulator of wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and has been implicated in metabolism, behavioral arousal, and mood. We believe orexin agonists have the potential to treat a wide range of neurological disorders characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, which are inadequately treated today, most notably NT1.
Orexin-A and Orexin-B, or hypocretin-1 and hypocretin-2, are two closely related orexin peptides that regulate the sleep-wake cycle and they project, or connect, to many regions of the brain including areas that control feeding, learning and memory, emotion and attention, metabolism and the endocrine system. Orexin peptides activate two orexin receptors, the Orexin Receptor-1 (OXR1) and OXR2. The orexin receptors have different and complementary distributions in the brain, suggesting they have distinct physiological roles acting through different neuronal pathways. The orexin-producing neurons located in the hypothalamus project to multiple regions throughout the brain. Orexin neurons release the neuropeptides Orexin-A and Orexin-B, which activate orexin receptors. In NT1, the neurons that produce orexin are lost. Orexin agonists can potentially re-activate orexin receptors and restore orexin neurotransmission. Enhanced wakefulness has now been associated with OX2R agonist administration in individuals with NT1, in two clinical studies reported by Takeda, providing clinical validation of the orexin hypothesis.
Orexin agonists have long been sought as the first therapeutic intervention that will directly address the underlying disease pathology of NT1, with the potential to re-activate orexin receptors which remain in the brain in postsynaptic neurons even after the loss of the natural orexin, as shown in the figure below.
Figure 32: Schematic representation of the orexin neurotransmitter system.
Our orexin agonist program provides a potential ‘replacement therapy approach’ that could constitute a new paradigm in the treatment of NT1 by restoring orexin neurotransmission in the brain, and ultimately, addressing a broader range of NT1 symptoms than current therapies. Data from the first clinical studies evaluating an orexin agonist have been reported recently by Takeda, which demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of daytime sleepiness in individuals with NT1 and NT2, as well as enhanced wakefulness in sleep-deprived healthy adults. We believe these results suggest that orexin agonists may also have therapeutic potential in indications where patients are symptomatic despite normal orexin levels, or where there is only partial loss of orexin. We plan to explore orexin agonists in a wide range of disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, which may provide opportunities to address indications beyond NT1.
Competition and Market Opportunity
Sales for narcolepsy treatments in the U.S. totaled approximately $1.9 billion in 2020, a figure which is expected to grow through investments in physician education and patient awareness that may lead to earlier and increased diagnosis rates, the introduction of innovative therapies with improved safety and efficacy profiles, and population growth.
While prevailing treatment approaches may address the symptoms of NT1, there are no currently approved therapies that address the loss of orexin, which is the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. For NT1, the current treatment paradigm typically involves a polypharmacy approach to address EDS and cataplexy. There are currently eight medications approved for treatment of narcolepsy in the US which include traditional stimulants, wake-promoting agents, sodium oxybate and an antagonist/inverse agonist at histamine 3 (H3) receptors.
Three of these medications are approved for treatment of EDS and/or cataplexy in narcolepsy: WAKIX® (pitolisant) marketed by Harmony Biosciences, XYREM® (sodium oxybate) marketed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Jazz), and XYWAV® (calcium oxybate; magnesium oxybate; potassium oxybate; sodium oxybate) also marketed by Jazz. Five additional medications are marketed for treatment of excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy: modafinil; armodafinil; methylphenidate; amphetamine salts; and SUNOSI® (solriamfetol) marketed by Jazz. All of these approved medications, except for WAKIX®, are scheduled as controlled substances. Other prescription drugs are used off-label for the treatment of either EDS or cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy, including stimulants for EDS and antidepressants for cataplexy. Some of the current therapies have significant side effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, or black box warnings due to the risk of respiratory depression, abuse and dependence, as well as the potential for rebound and withdrawal symptoms.
Despite the benefits of current treatments, these provide only moderate improvement in narcolepsy symptoms according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and side effects may limit their use. Based on the overall benefit-risk assessment of current medications, the FDA Voice of the Patient report published in 2014 concluded that there is a 
continued need for additional effective and tolerable treatment options for patients with narcolepsy, and we believe that this unmet need persists today to a similar extent due to the lack of medications that treat the underlying orexin deficiency in NT1.
XYREM® is a Schedule III controlled substance available only through a restricted access REMS program. Despite a black box warning, annual global sales for XYREM® and XYWAV® were approximately $1.8 billion in 2021. WAKIX® was approved in the U.S. in 2019 and is approved in certain European countries for treatment of narcolepsy (EDS and cataplexy), with total revenue of approximately $305 million for 2021. 
There is another sodium oxybate candidate in development, FT218 from Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc (Avadel), currently undergoing NDA review by the FDA. There are also other orexin agonist approaches being investigated. Takeda is pursuing TAK-861 in Phase 1 clinical development after announcing its lead molecule in Phase 2, TAK-994, would not advance. Takeda has disclosed that they believe the toxicity observed with TAK-994 was an idiosyncratic molecule-specific effect and not a class effect. We are also aware of one orexin agonist program in Phase 1 clinical development, DSP-0187 being investigated by Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. (Sumitomo) and several other orexin agonist programs in preclinical development.
Our Product Candidates
We are progressing two orexin agonist programs, one for orally administered treatments and the other for intranasally administered molecules, as novel treatments for NT1 with the potential to establish a new global standard of care. Intranasal administration may provide an additional option for patients, offering increased convenience and possibly faster onset of action. Our lead molecules are designed to selectively target the Orexin Receptor-2 (OX2R). Both oral and intranasal programs have been based on structure-based drug design.
The orexin receptors are neuropeptidic GPCRs in the central nervous system and therefore represent a particularly challenging target for drug discovery. Indeed, one of the key challenges for a small molecule orexin agonist program is the design of a brain penetrant, highly potent and selective structure that can mimic the precise binding and activating properties of the native peptide, which is approximately seven-fold larger in size than the average small molecule drug.
We seek to unlock the potential of the OX2R via an advanced understanding of the receptor’s structure through stabilization of the OX2R GPCR protein. GPCRs are inherently unstable proteins when isolated from the cell membrane. Structural and biophysical characterization of protein-drug interactions, however, requires the expression and often purification of stable protein with an appropriate structural conformation. Through a collaboration with Sosei Heptares, we have exclusive access to a stabilized OX2R GPCR protein, known as StaR®, which has enabled the determination of three-dimensional structures via X-ray crystallography, Cryo-EM and Biophysical Mapping™. This is achieved by engineering a small number of single point mutations outside of the ligand-binding site that enable the protein to retain its organized structure even after it has been removed from the cell membrane. The resulting stabilized StaR protein is more robust than the corresponding “wild-type”, or unmutated protein and can be readily purified for use in a variety of hit discovery and biophysical approaches.
By leveraging the StaR protein, we have exclusive access to a number of high-resolution OX2R co-crystal structures with small molecules and peptides, as shown in the exemplar figures below, which have enabled the discovery and design of highly potent OX2R agonists through SBDD.
Figure 33: Example structures of OX2R agonists.
As part of discovery efforts to support future innovation, we also have a collaboration with X-Chem, a pioneer of DNA-encoded chemical library (DEL), technology, to leverage its DEL platform to discover small molecule leads by screening hundreds of billions of novel lead-like small molecule compounds simultaneously. The collaboration has resulted in the discovery of multiple novel hits, and it is the direct result of X-Chem screening its drug-like DNA-encoded libraries (DEX™) against the OX2R StaR® protein.
We also recently announced an exclusive collaboration with Schrödinger focused on the discovery of novel therapeutics targeting OX2R. Discovery efforts will focus on small molecules with differentiated clinical profiles to harness the broad potential of orexin agonism across different indications. The collaboration provides us with substantial access to Schrödinger’s entire computational platform as well as Schrödinger’s extensive expertise in ultra-large-scale deployment of its technology. We are leveraging Schrödinger’s computational platform, including LiveDesign and Free Energy Perturbation (FEP+), which facilitates high-performance calculations for drug discovery to enable accurate prediction of potency at the target of interest. The collaboration is enabled by our structural biology capabilities, including the stabilized OX2R StaR® protein exclusively licensed from Sosei Heptares, and high-resolution crystal structures in agonist conformation. The collaboration represents the first time Schrödinger’s technology is applied in an orexin agonist setting at scale enabled by our structural biology capabilities.
Preclinical Data
Our OX2R agonists are designed with the aim to maximize benefit for reduced excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, as well as potential reduction of additional symptoms, in individuals with NT1. Both programs are now in advanced lead optimization phase, with compounds now being evaluated in preclinical mouse models of NT1. Progress and selected preclinical results for each series are described below.
Oral Program
We are in lead optimization phase with two oral lead series and have additional series under development. Our lead series are represented by exemplar small molecules, which were observed to have demonstrated agonist activity at the recombinant human OX2R overexpressed in CHO cells by calcium flux assay and IP1 accumulation assay, as shown in the figures below.
Figure 34: In vitro functional profile of selected Exemplar Small Molecule agonists in a calcium mobilization FLIPR assay with cells expressing recombinant human OX2R. Agonist-stimulated calcium (Ca2+) mobilization activity was normalized to EC100 of the natural peptide Orexin-A (OX-A). All four exemplar small molecules were observed to behave as a potent full agonist relative to OX-A.
Figure 35: In vitro OX2 IP1 accumulation activity profile for the Exemplar Small Molecule agonist ORX-848 in cells expressing recombinant human OX2R. Agonist-stimulated inositol-1-phosphate (IP1) accumulation activity was normalized to EC100 of the natural peptide Orexin-A (OX-A). ORX-848 was observed to behave as a potent full agonist relative to OX-A.
In addition, the Exemplar Compound ORX-848 showed agonist activity at the native mouse OX2R, as assessed in brain slices containing the histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). This is a primary target of orexin innervation that plays a central role in control of sleep/wake states and is modulated by activity at the OX2R.
Figure 36: Whole cell current-clamp recordings for the Exemplar Small Molecule agonist ORX-848 in mouse brain slices showed agonist activity at the endogenous mouse OX2R. These electrophysiological recordings showed that ORX-848 depolarized histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), a primary target of orexin innervation that plays a central role in control of sleep/wake states.
The exemplar small molecule also showed dose dependent effects in increasing wakefulness in wild-type mice, and in the orexin/ataxin-3 narcolepsy model in which mice lose ≥ 95% of their orexin-producing neurons, which are shown in the figure below. Sleep/wake was detected by piezoelectric monitoring, which is a rapid, non-invasive method for classifying sleep and wakefulness by unsupervised machine learning on physiologically relevant readouts, such as body movement and breath rate, with high correlation to conventional, time-intensive electroencephalogram (EEG) /electromyogram (EMG) readouts. 
Figure 37: In vivo wake-promotion efficacy profile for two exemplar small molecule agonists. ORX-564 and ORX-848 significantly increased wakefulness in both the NT1 model mice (orexin/ataxin-3) and wild type colony mates. Compounds were administered orally at 0, 3, and 30 mg/kg, five hours after light onset. Wakefulness was detected by piezoelectric monitoring and found to increase in the first hour post dose (P < 0.05 vs. 0 mg/kg (*) or 3 mg/kg (+), Bonferroni-corrected contrasts following one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance.)
We are currently optimizing metabolic stability, CNS penetration, and efflux parameters to identify potent, selective OX2R agonists for oral administration with the desired pharmacokinetic and safety profile.
Intranasal Program
We are also in lead optimization phase with proprietary orexin agonist peptide series. The current focus is on profiling selective high-potency peptides to assess CNS penetration and develop methods to facilitate delivery of pharmacologically active doses to the nasal cavity in small dosing volumes. The in vitro profile of several exemplar peptide agonists is illustrated below. These peptides have been observed to show high affinity binding and potent agonist activity at the recombinant human OX2R, similar to the endogenous OXA peptide, as illustrated in the figure below. In part (A), the exemplar peptides showed high affinity binding at the OX2R with complete displacement of 125I-OXA. The competitive binding profile is shown in cell membranes expressing recombinant human OX2R. Binding was calculated as a percent inhibition of the specific binding of radiolabeled orexin A peptide (125I-OXA). In part (B), the exemplar peptides showed potent agonist activity in the IP1 accumulation assay in cells expressing recombinant human OX2R, and were observed to behave as a potent full agonists relative to OX-A. Agonist-stimulated inositol-1-phosphate (IP1) accumulation activity was normalized to the EC100 of the natural peptide Orexin-A (OX-A). In part (C), the exemplar peptides also behaved as potent, full agonists in a calcium mobilization functional FLIPR assay relative to OX-A. The assay was conducted in cells expressing recombinant human OX2R, and agonist-stimulated calcium (Ca2+) mobilization activity was normalized to EC100 of OX-A. 
Figure 38: In vitro profiling of three Exemplar Peptide OX2R agonists, INX-137, INX-226, and INX-234.
Intracerebroventricular (ICV) drug administration consists of a direct injection of the drug into the brain. Several lead peptides were associated with increased wakefulness in wildtype mice when administered ICV, as shown in the figure below for an exemplar peptide. Sleep/wake was measured using the PiezoSleep assay, as described above.
Figure 39: In vivo wake-promotion efficacy profile for Exemplar Peptide INX-091. INX-091 significantly increased wakefulness in wild type mice. The peptide was administered directly to brain by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection at 0, 3, and 30 nmol, five hours after light onset to wild type mice. Wakefulness was detected by piezoelectric monitoring and found to increase in the first hour post dose (P < 0.05 vs. 0 nmol (*), Bonferroni-corrected contrasts following one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance).
Orexin agonist peptides are currently being evaluated in preclinical species using intranasal administration. Preliminary CMC work and formulation development is underway.
Development Plan
We continue to apply our structural biology technology, now in association with Schrödinger’s computation platform, to provide further insights into the orexin receptor binding pocket in order to develop differentiated molecules which are designed to address a potential range of different target product profiles. We plan to submit INDs/CTAs for our lead programs in 2023, and we anticipate initiating clinical Phase 1 studies thereafter. We intend to explore additional indications beyond NT1 in which orexin agonism may yield therapeutical benefit.
Exploratory programs
CBS001 in Inflammatory / Fibrotic Diseases
Summary
We are developing CBS001, a neutralizing therapeutic mAb to the inflammatory membrane form of LIGHT (known as TNFSF14) for the treatment of inflammatory / fibrotic diseases. We have received authorization from the MHRA to start a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers (planned to start in the second quarter of 2022). CBS001 is from our subsidiary Capella Bioscience Limited (Capella).
Figure 40: LIGHT can influence both structural and inflammatory cells to promote fibrosis.
The protein LIGHT has been found elevated in the serum or sputum of patients suffering from a number of inflammatory diseases with a fibrotic component, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis and colitis. LIGHT can regulate infiltrating T cells, macrophages, and eosinophils, controlling their trafficking or retention in the inflamed tissue, their proliferation and their ability to produce cytokines that amplify fibrotic processes. Activation of the LIGHT signaling cascade therefore can lead to hyperplasia of lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, vascular damage and further immune alterations that in concert constitute fibrosis. By signaling in tandem on inflammatory and structural cells, through lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTßR) and herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), LIGHT is able to control the expression of major pro-fibrotic factors such as TGF-ß, IL-13 and TSLP and these factors combined can subsequently regulate hyperplasia of fibroblasts, epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells, and promote deposition of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen. Additionally, LIGHT can regulate accumulation of Th2 cells, chemokines that attract these and other 
immune cells, adhesion molecules that will maintain the inflammatory environment and other factors such as metalloproteinases that can participate in the fibrotic response.
Our Product Candidate
CBS001 is designed to be a high-affinity mAb blocking the binding of the inflammatory membrane form of LIGHT to its signaling receptors, HVEM and LTßR. This mAb is differentiated from other anti-LIGHT mAbs, which bind soluble and membrane forms equally. The below graphic illustrates the differentiated epitope targeted by CBS001.
Figure 41: Binding epitope of CBS001
LIGHT is not present in normal lung tissue, which we believe provides the potential for CBS001 to be differentiated in its safety profile. Elevated levels of LIGHT have been found in the serum or sputum of patients suffering from a number of inflammatory diseases with a fibrotic component. 
In preclinical testing, we have observed that CBS001 has a long half-life of approximately 25 days and robust potency. We believe these properties may support dosing once every one to two months.
Preclinical Data
We have tested CBS001 against all available anti-LIGHT mAbs in in vitro studies and CBS001 was observed to have greater potency (as measured by IC50) than the competitor antibodies and is ten times more potent than CERC-002. CBS001 inhibits binding of membrane LIGHT to HVEM and LTßR as well as showing high potency in inhibiting IL-8 release from a cell based assay expressing HVEM or LTßR.
Figure 42: CBS001 potency in several assays.
The above figure demonstrates that CBS001 is 10-fold more potent than CERC-002 in a cell based IL-8 inhibition assay (A); and in vitro assays of (B) cell binding assay; (C) inhibition LIGHT-HVEM binding and (D) inhibition LIGHT-LTBR binding.
In addition, CBS001 does not compete with the natural LIGHT inhibitor DcR3 in binding excess LIGHT as do all other anti-LIGHT mAbs, which is due to the unique epitope of CBS001. CBS001 inhibits IFNg and the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-17 from activated T cells in primary cell assays. Importantly, LIGHT is also expressed on Th17 cells.
Figure 43: Activity of CBS001 on inhibition of IL-17, IFNg and TNF from CMV lysate stimulated PBMC over a five-day incubation period, against controls of nivolumab, tofacitinib and human IgG4.
Th17 cells have been demonstrated to play a role in the progression of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease. The Th17 cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in target tissues, which not only mediate inflammation through the recruitment of innate immune cells such as neutrophils, but also promote further Th17 activation in a positive feedback manner. This enhances the case that LIGHT through the downstream inhibition of IL-17 (among other mechanisms) offers pathway validation in the form of other approved agents neutralizing IL-17 as their mechanism of action.
In a preclinical model of lung fibrosis induced with bleomycin in humanized mice we have shown that CBS001 significantly reduces severe fibrosis as measured by Ashcroft score or fibrosis.
Figure 44: Reduction of fibrosis by CBS001.
In the above figure, humanized mice were treated with bleomycin at day 0 and the level of fibrosis was quantitated by immunohistochemistry on day 11 in the presence of CBS001 and compared to control IgG4 or PBS.
In human IPF lung tissue, we have shown high LIGHT expression co-expressed with CD4 and CD8 cells by immunohistochemistry in areas of inflammatory cell infiltration. LIGHT was also present on neutrophils and T effector memory cells in these sections. Importantly, no LIGHT expression was evident in normal lung. Studies in IPF have demonstrated the abundance of T and B lymphocytes and the presence of lymphocyte aggregates resembling lymphoid follicles in IPF and these structures correlate with disease progression.
Pharmacokinetic studies in non-human primates (NHP) have shown that CBS001 has an exceptionally long half-life of approximately 25 days, which we believe could support monthly or potentially bi-monthly dosing in human subjects.
GLP safety studies have been completed in NHP and human LIGHT KI mice and no safety issues have been observed as well.
CBS001 is a stable mAb that is expressed at high yield from the CMC expression system. An intravenous formulation will be evaluated in the Phase 1 clinical study.
Development Plan
We expect to commence a Phase 1 study in the second quarter of 2022. The primary aim of this study will be to assess the safety and tolerability of CBS001 treatment in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of CBS001 treatment are expected to be evaluated.
CBS004 in SSc, SLE and Other Autoimmune Diseases
Summary
We are developing CBS004, a therapeutic mAb to target BDCA-2 for the treatment of lupus erythematosus, both systemic and cutaneous (SLE and CLE, respectively), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and other autoimmune diseases. We expect to submit an IND to the FDA in late 2022. CBS004 is from our subsidiary Capella. 
Disease Overview
Systemic Sclerosis
SSc is a connective tissue disorder characterized primarily by the thickening and hardening of the skin. There are two primary types of scleroderma: localized and systemic, also known as systemic sclerosis. In localized scleroderma, the disease affects mainly the skin and may have an impact on the muscles and bones. In systemic scleroderma, there is an involvement of the internal organs, such as the digestive tract, heart, lungs and kidneys. The causes of SSc are not fully known. There is evidence that genetic and environmental factors may play a role in the genesis of scleroderma. The result is an activation of the immune system, causing blood vessel damage and injury to tissues that result in scar tissue formation and the accumulation of excess collagen. SSc is a rare disease and its prevalence varies with ethnicity, gender, and geographic area. Women are at higher risk than men. Systemic scleroderma can occur at any age; however, it is rare in children and the elderly. The disease is most prevalent in individuals aged 30-50 years.
In summary, SSc is a complex, multi-organ disease which has a high burden of patient morbidity. The mortality rate is increasing in the U.S. and Europe and generally, renal and lung changes are responsible for death in patients. Pulmonary hypertension leads to 12% of SSc–related deaths and lung fibrosis and heart changes are responsible for 9% of systemic sclerosis–related deaths.
Lupus Erythematosus
Lupus is associated with multisystemic inflammation resulting from abnormal immunological function. Patients experience periodic flares of varying severity or instances in which no observable signs or symptoms are present. SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease, with multisystemic involvement. The disease has several phenotypes, with varying clinical presentations in patients ranging from mild mucocutaneous manifestations to multi-organ and severe central nervous system involvement. SLE is a multifactorial disease with unknown exact etiology; however, several genetic, immunological, endocrine and environmental factors play a role in the etiopathogenesis of SLE. More than 50 genes or genomic loci have been identified to be associated with SLE, most encoding proteins implicated in the function of the immune system. The prevalence of the disease is approximately 70 per 100,000 persons and incidence rates of 5.6 per 100,000 person-years in primarily Caucasian and African-American populations, with African-Americans presenting the highest rates. SLE predominantly affects women of childbearing age.
Cutaneous manifestations are frequently the presenting sign of lupus erythematosus and in the case of certain CLE subtypes, they can occur in the absence of systemic disease. CLE is divided into several subtypes and is two to three times more frequent than SLE. Similar to proposed etiologies for SLE, current theories include genetic susceptibility, autoimmune induction and immune system damage.
It is critical for the immune system to avoid the recognition of self DNA and self RNA while retaining the ability to sense microbial nucleic acids. The innate immune system appears to have elaborated several distinct mechanisms to discriminate pathogen derived exogenous nucleic acids and host derived self-nucleic acids. However, there is considerable emerging evidence that recognition of self-nucleic acids by toll-like receptors (TLRs) located on plasma dendritic cells (pDCs) occurs under certain circumstances even though the innate immune system evolved distinct mechanisms to prevent self-recognition. The resulting chronically activated pDCs, and the IFNα that they produce in response to self-nucleic acids are thought to be a primary contributor in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, including SSc and SLE.
pDCs are bone marrow derived cells specialized in the secretion of type I IFN and are mainly found in peripheral blood and in primary and secondary lymphoid organs. pDCs promptly detect viral nucleic acids, which are endocytosed and delivered to endosomes containing TLR7 and TLR9. Engagement of these toll-like receptors results in the immediate release of type I IFN (IFN-I), providing a very early defense against viral infections. pDCs also secrete IFN-I in response to endogenous nucleic acids that are released during cell necrosis and/or apoptosis or are bound to antinuclear autoantibodies. pDCs secrete approximately 1,000 times more IFNα than any other cell type and are the primary source of this inflammatory mediator.
BDCA-2 is a C-type lectin exclusively expressed on the surface of human pDCs. BDCA-2 transmits intracellular signals through an associated transmembrane adaptor, the FceRIg, and induces a B-cell receptor-like signaling cascade which promotes the production of IFN-I and other chemicals, BDCA-2 receptor ligation by mAbs has been shown to inhibit TLR7-or TLR9-induced production of IFN-I and other pDC-derived pro-inflammatory mediators.
pDCs have been implicated in the development and progression of both SSc and SLE/CLE. pDCs infiltrate the skin of these patients and are chronically activated, leading to the secretion of IFNα and other inflammatory mediators that 
are hallmarks of the disease. Several studies on IFN inducible chemokines in SSc and the report on CXCL4 as a biomarker of SSc build on the role of IFN in the progression and early phases of SSc as well as SLE/CLE. In fact, the IFN signature is present before the onset of clinical fibrosis and provides a strong rationale for the use of an anti-BDCA-2 treatment approach in SSc.
Importantly, the therapeutic potential of an anti-BDCA-2 antibody (BIIB059) has been observed in Phase 2 studies in SLE and CLE.
Competition and Market Opportunity
The global SSc market is mainly driven by the off-label use of drugs approved for its symptomatic indications, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Lack of curative therapies and high prevalence of off-label drug use are underlying factors spurring interest in this rare disease market. The global SSc therapeutics market size was valued at approximately $1.6 billion in 2018 and is estimated to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 6.0% from 2019 to 2026.
With respect to drug class, the SSc market is segmented into immunosuppressors, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists, prostacyclin analogues, calcium channel blockers, analgesics and others. Without a curative therapy for this disease, an expansive range of drug classes are prescribed to provide symptomatic relief, with immunosuppressants holding prominence. Therapies include OFEV® (nintedanib), marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH (Boehringer Ingelheim). 
The global SLE market size is expected to reach approximately $3.1 billion by 2025, representing a CAGR of 7.0%. A competitor anti-BDCA-2 mAb (BIIB059 being developed by Biogen) has shown promise in Phase 2 clinical trials for both SLE and CLE. Another pDc targeting mAb VIB7734 is in development by Horizon Therapeutics plc (Horizon) as a pDC-depleting agent, currently in Phase 2 clinical development. In a Phase 1b trial, CLE patients treated with VIB7734 were observed to have clinically significant improvements in extent and severity of skin lesions. Additionally, AstraZeneca is marketing SAPHNELO®, anifrolumab, an anti-type I interferon receptor subunit 1 antibody that was recently approved by the FDA for moderate to severe SLE. BENLYSTA® (belimumab) is a human monoclonal antibody developed by GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) which binds to B cell activating factory. BENLYSTA® was approved to treat lupus in 2011 and is the first drug approved for this disease in the last 50 years. In 2020, BENLYSTA® was approved for the treatment of lupus nephritis. 
New therapies are needed for those patients who only see marginal benefit with BENLYSTA® treatment, and the SLE market remains open for future competition. 
Our Product Candidate
CBS004 is our preclinical humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the pDC-specific cell surface protein BDCA-2. By targeting BDCA-2, CBS004 inhibits intracellular signaling through an associated transmembrane adaptor, the FceRIg, and subsequently inhibits TLR7- or TLR9-induced production of IFN-I and other pDC-derived pro-inflammatory mediators.
CBS004 is a stable mAb and can be formulated for intravenous and/or subcutaneous administration. We believe that the long half-life of CBS004 in NHP of approximately 16 days supports a once-a-month dosing schedule at the minimum. We are seeking to develop CBS004 for treatment of lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.
Preclinical Data
We have evaluated the effects of antibody-mediated BDCA2 internalization in preclinical models of pDC driven skin inflammation and fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. First, we developed a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody, CBS004, which specifically binds to BDCA2 with high affinity without hindering cell viability. CBS004 suppressed Toll-like Receptor (TLR)-9 induced IFNα secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from both healthy volunteers and SSc patients. Additionally, CBS004 completely reversed TLR-signaling induced transcriptome of pDC, including activation of JAK/STAT, IL-6 and NF-kB pathways. Consistent with these findings, supernatants from TLR-stimulated human pDC treated with CBS004 failed to induce IFN stimulated gene expression in human keratinocytes and fibroblasts from organotypic 3D human skin cultures. We have generated data in two in vivo models in mice with CBS004. Firstly, a CLE like model, in which human pDC are injected into an immunocompromised mouse combined with topical Aldara (which acts as an immune response modifier) and secondly, a skin fibrosis model (human pDC plus bleomycin). In both of these models CBS004 decreased disease burden to control levels, indicating that CBS004 is a viable therapeutic approach for targeting both CLE and tissue fibrosis in SSc.
CBS004 appears to inhibit TLR9 induced IFN from pDC derived from healthy controls and SSc patients.
Figure 45: Activity of CBS004 on IFNα release.
The figure above illustrates PBMC from healthy or SSc patients, incubated overnight at 37C with 1uM ODN, a TLR9 agonist, in the absence or presence of CBS004 at the 10ug/ml concentration, with IFNα release measured by ELISA.
We are the first to demonstrate that pDC enhanced skin fibrosis in a bleomycin induced mouse model and we have shown that CBS004 reduced dermal and epidermal skin thickness induced by pDC back to control levels. In addition, CBS004 inhibited collagen accumulation and TGFß message. Transforming growth factor-ß (TGFß) is the primary factor that drives fibrosis and is often called the master regulator of fibrosis.
Mouse model of pDC induced fibrosis
Figure 46: CBS004 significantly reduced skin thickness induced by pDC and bleomycin back to control levels.
In the above figures, severe combined immunodeficient mice were utilized between four to eight weeks of age. Bleomycin at 200 µg/ml in PBS was injected subcutaneously into a single location on the shaved back of mice once every other day for 3 weeks. Mice received 2.5 x105 human pDC i.v. on day 0, 7 and 14 following the first bleomycin injection. CBS004 or human IgG control (5mg/kg) were injected i.p. every 5 days starting 24 hours prior to the first bleomycin injection. Treated skin was collected using a 3 mm punch biopsy and processed for haematoxylin and eosin and masson trichrome staining. 20 areas of epidermis and dermal thickness were measured in order to obtain a large representation of skin thickness changes with different treatment regimens in the skin fibrosis model. An additional punch biopsy was taken and used to extract protein. These readings were then averaged and determined that CBS004 reduced both dermal and epidermal changes back to control levels.
NHP studies have shown that CBS004 has a half-life of approximately 16 days and caused internalization of BDCA-2 for up to 35 days.
Development Plan
We are planning to submit an IND to the FDA in late 2022. We expect to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of CBS004 treatment in a Phase 1 clinical trial. 
Our Strategy
We have embarked on a journey to build a sustainable pharmaceutical company with a reimagined drug discovery approach that we believe has the potential to fundamentally reshape the traditional R&D model. We believe our highly experienced management team and leading subject matter experts, guided by a relentless focus on data-driven decision-making and capital efficiency, are well positioned to lead the advancement of our robust portfolio of assets in areas of high unmet need. With that in mind, we intend to continue to establish proof of concept and proof of mechanism for our current preclinical programs and continue to generate clinical data as we advance our portfolio through later-stage development.

Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the rapid evolution of technologies and understanding of disease etiology, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We believe that our differentiated business model, approach, scientific capabilities, know-how and experience provide us with competitive advantages. However, we face, and will continue to face, competition from companies focused on more traditional therapeutic modalities. We expect substantial competition from multiple sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and existing or emerging biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions worldwide. Many of our competitors, either alone or through collaborations, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large 
and established companies. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and recruiting patients in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do. The key competitors for our programs are described in the respective sections.
We also face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and licensing and acquisition opportunities, and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. As a result, we may not be successful in our efforts in building a pipeline of product candidates through acquisitions, licensing or through internal development or in progressing these product candidates through clinical development. Although our research and development efforts to date have resulted in the identification, discovery and preclinical and clinical development of certain product candidates, these product candidates may not be safe or effective as therapies, and we may not be able to develop, in-license or otherwise acquire any other product candidates.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), for all of our requirements of raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our preclinical research and our ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates. Other than as discussed below, most of our subsidiaries have not entered into long-term agreements with our current CMOs. We generally intend to continue to rely on CMOs for later-stage development and commercialization of our product candidates, including any additional product candidates that we may identify. Although we rely on CMOs, we have personnel and third-party consultants with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our CMOs and are not overly dependent on a single CMO.
Sales and Marketing
We intend to begin building a commercial infrastructure in the United States and selected other territories to support the commercialization of each of our product candidates when we believe a regulatory approval in a particular territory is likely. We intend to conduct market research in connection with designing our commercialization strategy for each of our product candidates, which strategy may depend on the size and geographic dispersion of the target patient population and the characteristics of the prescribing audience for our products, if approved. For example, certain of our product candidates that target diseases with a limited patient population, a concentrated prescribing audience and a small number of key opinion leaders who influence the treatments prescribed for the relevant patient population, we may address each such market using our own targeted, specialty sales and marketing organization supported by internal sales personnel, an internal marketing group and distribution support. For other product candidates, we may establish a larger and more dispersed salesforce, or seek strategic collaborations to support our commercialization efforts.
We intend to evaluate our commercialization strategy as we advance each product candidate through clinical development. In any core markets outside of the United States that we may identify, where appropriate, we may utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to expand the commercial availability of our product candidates.
Intellectual Property and License Agreements
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents and patent applications intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We have entered into various license agreements to obtain the rights to use certain patents for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. As described below, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights protecting our commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our current and future issued patents, if any, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our intellectual property portfolio. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any patents, if issued, will provide sufficient protection from competitors.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) to determine priority of invention.
Palladio
As of December 31, 2021, Palladio owns two pending U.S. patent application and six pending foreign applications in Japan, Europe, Australia, Canada, Mexico and Korea. Palladio’s patent portfolio includes claims directed to methods of treatment with lixivaptan. On February 8, 2022, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a patent entitled “Formulations of Lixivaptan for the Treatment of Polycystic Disease,” which has claims drawn to using a divided dose regimen of lixivaptan in treating ADPKD. The patent term expires June 8, 2038, before consideration of any applicable patent term extensions or adjustments and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees. Palladio has rights to one issued U.S. patent, which is expected to expire in 2030, without considering any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees.
In July 2016, Palladio acquired Cardiokine, Inc. from Chiesi USA, Inc. (Chiesi). In connection with the acquisition, Palladio acquired a license from Wyeth (now Pfizer) for lixivaptan and inherited certain historical contingent payment obligations (see below “Payments due to certain former Cardiokine stakeholders”) and agreed to make certain contingent consideration payments to Chiesi (see below “Payments due to Chiesi”). Palladio subsequently acquired the rights due to certain (but not all) former Cardiokine stakeholders, reducing the contingent future obligations (the “Repurchased Rights”). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of The Centessa Predecessor Group and Certain Other Acquired Entities — Licensing Arrangements — Palladio License Agreement” for more information.
Payments due to Chiesi
The terms of the Cardiokine acquisition from Chiesi included certain contingent consideration payments which would be due to Chiesi in the event a Licensed Product is commercialized. Such payments are structured as a tiered percentage of net sales with aggregate annual payment to Chiesi capped at $32.5 million.
Payments due to certain former Cardiokine stakeholders
There are certain consideration payments previously agreed with Cardiokine stakeholders that were inherited by Palladio when it acquired Cardiokine and such payment obligations remain and would be due in the event the payment criteria are met. These comprise sales based milestones and royalty payments, including sales based milestones to former stakeholders of up to $16.3 million and low single digit royalty payments (the first $19 million of which would be due to Pfizer). In all cases these amounts take into account the effect of the Repurchased Rights.
In the event Palladio sublicenses the ex-US rights to the Licensed Product to third parties, Palladio is further obligated to share any up-front payments and royalties it earns from such ex-US sublicenses, subject to certain caps, with the former Cardiokine stakeholders. Certain other obligations arise if Palladio develops the Licensed Product for indications other than ADPKD.
ApcinteX
As of December 31, 2021, ApcinteX has a license to two issued U.S. patents, 49 issued foreign patents, e.g., France, Germany, UK and China issued foreign patents, and three pending foreign patent applications. ApcinteX’s licensed patent portfolio includes issued U.S. patents and issued foreign patents, including patents in Europe, China, Japan, and Australia, which have claims directed to SerpinPC composition of matter, compositions of matter of other serpin variants, 
and method of use of SerpinPC. The issued patents expire in 2034, and the pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2034, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of The Centessa Predecessor Group and Certain Other Acquired Entities — Licensing Arrangements — ApcinteX License Agreement” for more information.
Pega-One 
As of December 31, 2021, Pega-One has a license to 13 issued U.S. patents, 130 issued foreign patents, one pending U.S. application, and three pending foreign patent applications. The issued U.S. and issued foreign patents, including patents in China and Japan, include claims directed to imgatuzumab (GA201) composition of matter and methods of use of imgatuzumab. The issued patents expire between 2022 and 2028, which do not include any possible patent term extension.
On January 2, 2020, Pega-One entered into a license agreement with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffman-La Roche Inc. (together, Roche), regarding the glycoengineered, anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody known as imgatuzumab. Under the license agreement, Roche granted Pega-One an exclusive (even as to Roche), worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable (subject to certain requirements) license under certain patent rights and know-how (including Roche’s interest in any joint patent rights or know-how) owned and controlled by Roche related to imgatuzumab and glycoengineering technology, to research, develop, make, and sell products containing imgatuzumab (Licensed Products), in all indications and uses in humans excluding diagnostic uses, or Field. Roche retains the right to use imgatuzumab for internal research purposes, subject to certain notice requirements prior to Roche starting any in vivo experiments. Any new patent rights or know-how resulting from Roche’s research will be automatically included in Roche’s license to Pega-One. Roche granted Pega-One an option to license any additional Roche inventions.
Roche also granted to Pega-One an exclusive (even as to Roche) sublicense of the worldwide rights licensed to Roche under its umbrella research and license agreement with Lonza Sales AG, solely to develop, make, and commercialize imgatuzumab and Licensed Products in the Field. To the extent needed, Roche agrees to negotiate a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to additional patent rights related to immunotherapy or small molecules in multiple oncolytic indications. Roche also sublicensed to Pega-One certain intellectual property rights related to a proprietary cell line to perform assays using imgatuzumab.
If Pega-One intends to enter into certain strategic transactions, either involving an acquisition or other change of control of Pega-One or the grant of rights by Pega-One to a third party, to develop and commercialize imgatuzumab or a Licensed Product in certain specified territories, Roche has an exclusive right of first negotiation to enter into the applicable strategic transaction with Pega-One. In connection with the Reorganization, Pega-One and Roche entered into a waiver, pursuant to which the parties acknowledged that the Reorganization would constitute a change of control transaction and Roche agreed not to exercise its right of first negotiation. Notwithstanding such waiver, Roche’s right of first negotiation would continue to apply for the period commencing on the completion of Centessa’s acquisition of Pega-One until the earlier of the third anniversary of such acquisition, or until the first change of control of Pega-One following such acquisition. 
In the future, if Pega-One files for an initial public offering, while maintaining control over the licensed imgatuzumab intellectual property, Roche is entitled to receive, immediately prior to the completion of the initial public offering, ownership of Pega-One common stock equivalent to a specified percentage of Pega-One on a fully diluted basis, depending on how much capital Pega-One has raised prior to such public offering. The completion of this Offering will not trigger the issuance of additional equity to Roche under this agreement.
Pega-One must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the imgatuzumab Licensed Product in the Field worldwide. Pega-One is solely responsible for the conduct of such activities relating to the Licensed Product worldwide in the Field at its own expense.
Roche granted to Pega-One a sublicensable right of reference to Roche’s regulatory filings relating to imgatuzumab or a Licensed Product, including the right to rely upon and a right to copy, access, and otherwise use, all information and data relating to Licensed Product filed with any regulatory agency responsible for granting authorization to market such products (including all underlying raw data, CMC information, and other regulatory documentation). 
Pega-One and Roche will each own any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by its employees, except that Roche will own any improvements to Roche’s glycoengineering technology. Any inventions jointly conceived or reduced 
to practice by employees of both parties will be owned jointly by the parties. Roche controls the prosecution and maintenance of those licensed patent rights relating to imgatuzumab at Pega-One’s expense and those relating to Roche’s glycoengineering technology at Roche’s expense. Pega-One controls the prosecution and maintenance of patent rights relating to its own inventions and the jointly-owned patent rights. Each party will inform each other on a regular basis on the status of the patent rights for which it controls prosecution and maintenance, including the formation from time to time of a patent coordination team. Each party must advise the other party prior to abandoning any applicable patent rights and assign such patent rights to the other party if the other party wishes to continue prosecution and maintenance at its own expense. If Roche decides not to prosecute or maintain a licensed patent, at Pega-One’s request, Roche will assign to Pega-One (at no cost to Roche) such patent in such country or countries in the territory. Such patent rights so assigned from Roche to Pega-One will no longer be subject to royalty payments. Pega-One has the first right to enforce any of its or Roche’s licensed patent rights with the exclusive right and responsibility to resolve any claim of infringement brought by a third party, except that Pega-One must obtain Roche’s prior written consent if any settlement would adversely affect Roche.
In exchange for the rights under the license agreement, Pega-One granted to Roche a number of ordinary shares of Pega-One and paid to Roche a nonrefundable upfront license fee in the low single-digits millions of dollars. Pega-One is also obligated to pay to Roche, for each Licensed Product, aggregate development milestone payments up to mid double-digit million dollars upon meeting certain regulatory, clinical, manufacturing, and commercial sale events. In addition, Pega-One is obligated to pay Roche sales milestone payments up to low single-digit hundred million dollars based on total worldwide aggregate annual net sales for each Licensed Product.
Upon commercialization of any Licensed Products, Pega-One is obligated to pay to Roche a tiered high-single digit royalty based on annual net sales on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis until the expiry of the royalty term. The royalty term will expire the later of (i) ten years after the date of first commercial sale of a Licensed Product, (ii) when there are no more valid claims under the licensed patents in the relevant country, or (iii) the date of expiration of the last to expire regulatory exclusivity for such Licensed Product in such country. The royalty payments are subject to certain reductions if there is a competing generic product, Pega-One considers it necessary to obtain a license to third party patents to avoid infringement, or if a court or governmental agency requires Pega-One to grant a compulsory license to a third party.
Unless terminated earlier, the license agreement expires on the date when no royalty or other payment obligations under this Agreement are or will become due. Pega-One may terminate the license agreement at any time in its entirety or on a product-by-product basis upon sufficient written notice. Either party may terminate the license agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement without timely cure or becomes insolvent. Upon termination of the agreement, the rights granted by one party to the other will terminate in their entirety, or on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis. If Pega-One terminates without cause, breaches the agreement, or becomes insolvent, Roche may elect to continue development of the imgatuzumab product, and Pega-One must transfer to Roche (free of charge) all regulatory filings and approvals, clinical and non-clinical agreements, CMC agreements, and other related development contracts. Pega-One must also grant Roche a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable, transferable license under its patent, know-how, and joint patent rights to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, offer to sell, sell, promote, export and import imgatuzumab and related products. If termination occurs after completion of a Phase 2 study of the first product, Roche will pay to Pega-One a royalty percentage rate in the low single digits based on net sales of the imgatuzumab product for ten years after the first commercial sale of the product on a country-by-country basis. If termination occurs after the first regulatory approval of the first product, Roche will pay to Pega-One a royalty percentage rate in the mid-single digits of net sales for ten years after the first commercial sale of the product on a country-by-country basis. Pega-One may not assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without prior written consent from Roche, except to an affiliate or in the context of a merger, acquisition, sale or other transaction involving all or substantially all of the assets of Pega-One. 
Z Factor
As of December 31, 2021, Z Factor, owned one pending U.S. patent application, 24 pending foreign applications and seven pending PCT applications. Z Factor’s patent portfolio includes composition of matter claims directed to ZF874, polymorphs thereof and variants thereof, method of treatment claims with ZF874, and method of manufacturing claims related to ZF874. The pending patent applications, once nationalized and if issued, are expected to expire between 2039 and 2042, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of The Centessa Predecessor Group and Certain Other Acquired Entities — Licensing Arrangements — Z Factor License Agreement” for more information.

Morphogen-IX’s licensed patent portfolio includes issued U.S. patents and issued foreign patents, which have composition of matter claims directed to MGX292 and BMP9 variants, and method of treatment claims with MGX292. The issued patents expire in 2035, and the pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2035, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees.
Morphogen-IX License Agreement
On October 30, 2015, our subsidiary, Morphogen-IX Limited, (“Morphogen-IX”), entered into a Patent and Know-How License Agreement (“License”), with Cambridge Enterprise Limited (a company wholly owned by the University of Cambridge) (“CE”), relating to BMP 9 and 10. Pursuant to the agreement, Morphogen-IX obtained from CE an exclusive, worldwide, royalty bearing, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) license, (the “Exclusive CE License”), under certain patent rights, (“BMP Patents”), and certain technical information and materials relating to BMP 9 and 10, (“BMP Know-How”), for the treatment of all diseases, including prophylaxis, for human and animal health or any related research or development, or the Field. Morphogen-IX also obtained a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) license, (“the CE Non-Exclusive License”), to under certain, data, technical information and other know-how that is not specific to BMP 9 and 10, (the “Non-Exclusive Know-How”). Under the CE Exclusive License and the CE Non-Exclusive License, Morphogen-IX has the right to develop and commercialize any product, process, service or use that uses or incorporates any BMP Patents, the BMP Know-How or the Non-Exclusive Know-How, or any materials that are sold in conjunction with any such products or services, in each such case, a Licensed Product. CE has reserved a customary limited right to use the BMP Patents, BMP Know-How and Non-Exclusive Know-How for academic publication, teaching, and academic research.
In addition to the rights described above, Morphogen-IX also obtained the right to exclusively license, upon request, any and all improvements, modifications, and other developments to the BMP Patents or the BMP Know-how arising during the term of the agreement, or BMP Improvements, provided that such BMP Improvements have been created by any or all of the inventors named in the BMP Patent and assigned to CE within 3 years from the effective date of the agreement.
Morphogen-IX must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the Licensed Products in accordance with the development plan, to introduce Licensed Products into the commercial market and to market Licensed Products after such introduction in the market, and to commit the necessary and available funding and personnel to maximize sales and corresponding return to CE under the License Agreement. Morphogen-IX, at its own cost, has the right to control the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the BMP Patents. CE has certain step-in rights if Morphogen-IX does not conduct certain BMP patent-related activities as set forth in the License Agreement.
In consideration for the rights granted by CE under the License Agreement, Morphogen- IX is obligated to reimburse CE for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by CE prior to the effective date of the License Agreement and pay an annual license fee of $14,000 (£10,000 at an exchange rate of 0.74).
Additionally, Morphogen-IX is obligated to pay CE certain milestone payments in the aggregate amount of up to $1.1 million (£0.8 million at an exchange rate of 0.74) upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Upon commercialization of any Licensed Products, Morphogen-IX is obligated to pay CE a low single-digit royalty based on Morphogen-IX’s or its sublicensee’s annual net sales for each Licensed Product in the relevant country until the expiry of the royalty term, subject customary royalty deductions for necessary third party licenses. In countries where valid claims exist under the licensed patents, royalties are payable on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis until there are no more valid claims under the licensed patents in the relevant country.
Unless terminated earlier, the agreement will be in effect until the licensed patents have expired or been revoked without a right of further appeal; Morphogen-IX retains the right to use the licensed know-how in such circumstances. Morphogen-IX may terminate the License Agreement at any time for convenience with adequate written notice to CE. Either party may terminate the License Agreement based on customary termination rights. CE retains the right to terminate the agreement if Morphogen-IX challenges the validity or ownership of the BMP patents.
Capella Bioscience

PearlRiver C797 License Agreement
In June 2020, PearlRiver Bio entered to an assignment agreement with Lead Discovery Center GmbH and TU Dortmund (together the “Assignors”), involving small molecule inhibitors of C797 mutated EGFR and related inventions (C797, or Product). Under the assignment agreement, the Assignors each and jointly sold, assigned and transferred to PearlRiver Bio their entire right, title and interest to certain know-how, patent application, invention disclosures, chemical and biological materials, and data analyses related to C797 (“Assigned Technology”). PearlRiver Bio has the sole right but not the obligation to control patent prosecution at its own cost. To the extent requested by PearlRiver Bio, and not included under the Assigned Technology, Assignors also agreed to grant a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, right and license under C797 related intellectual property rights and/or know-how, for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, marketing, selling and/or otherwise commercializing any products or medical technology based on or comprising C797. PearlRiver Bio is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts commercialize one or more Products at its own expense.
In consideration for the rights under the assignment agreement, PearlRiver Bio paid Assignors an upfront fee in the mid-to-high five-digit range in euros. In addition, PearlRiver Bio is obligated to pay Assignors up to a high single-digit millions in euros in total aggregate milestone payments upon meeting certain clinical and approval milestones and up to low double digit millions in euros in total aggregate sales milestone payments.
Upon commercialization of any Products, PearlRiver Bio is obligated to pay to Assignors a tiered low single-digit royalty based on annual net sales on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis until the expiry of the royalty term. The royalty term will expire upon the later of (i) the date on which the manufacture, distribution, use, marketing or sale of such Product in such country no longer infringes a valid claim of a patent in such country or (ii) ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of such Product in such country. The royalty payments are subject to certain reductions if for third party licenses.
If PearlRiver Bio materially breaches the assignment agreement (including a breach of payment obligations), the Assignors may withdraw from the agreement. In such event, PearlRiver Bio is obligated to retransfer its rights to the Assigned Technology to the Assignors. However, in case of withdrawal, PearlRiver Bio will automatically receive a non-exclusive, transferable license, which includes the right to sublicense in multiple tiers, to use the Assigned Technology for the development, manufacture, testing, authorization and/or commercialization of any technology and/or compounds, drug substance and/or drug products based on C797 and/or the Assigned Technology. PearlRiver Bio will still be responsible for any milestone and royalty payments described above.
PearlRiver Lead Discovery Center License Agreement
In March 2019, Lead Discovery Center GmbH (Lead Discovery) entered into a license agreement with PearlRiver Bio related to small molecule inhibitors of Her2 and EGFR carrying Exon 20 mutations. Under the license agreement, PearlRiver Bio obtained an exclusive, worldwide, transferable and sublicensable (subject to certain conditions) license, under certain patents, patent applications, technical information and licensed know-how, to research, develop, make, use, manufacture, have manufactured, offer, promote, sell, import or export products that use or incorporate the licensed know-how and technology. PearlRiver Bio also obtained a non-exclusive, worldwide, transferable and sublicensable (subject to certain conditions) license, under the Lead Discovery’s background intellectual property, to research, develop, make, use, manufacture, have manufactured, offer, promote, sell, import or export products and/or otherwise exploit the licensed technology. Lead Discovery retains the non-exclusive, non-transferable, cost-free right to make, have made and use specific materials for internal non-commercial scientific research purposes, and to provide materials for non-commercial collaborations not interfering with the development of the products under the license agreement, and for other scientific purposes solely to non-profit research organisations.
In consideration for the rights under the license agreement, PearlRiver Bio is to pay Lead Discovery low single-digit royalties on the net sales of each licensed product that is sold or supplied by PearlRiver Bio or any of its sublicensees (subject to certain scenarios). Royalties are on a product-by-product and country-by country basis. Payments will commence with the first commercial sale of such product in a country and continue for the later of: (i) the date on which the manufacture, distribution, marketing or sale of a Product no longer infringes a valid claim (being a claim from an unexpired patent right or a patent application using the licensed technology) in such country; or (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale in such country. Additionally, PearlRiver Bio is required to pay certain one-time tiered milestone payments, on a molecule-by-molecule basis, in the low double digits million pounds sterling, and a one-time low double digits million pounds sterling sales milestone once cumulative net sales equal or exceed £0.5BN.
The license agreement lasts until terminated or until the last royalty term expires. PearlRiver Bio may terminate the agreement for convenience at its sole discretion with adequate written notice to Lead Discovery. Each party has customary termination rights in the event of breach. Lead Discovery is able to terminate in the event PearlRiver Bio notifies Lead Discovery of an intent to cease activities related to the licensed technology or the termination of the development of all Exon 20 development activities. In the event of termination, all licenses would cease and all research, development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of products that use or incorporate the licensed know-how and any other use of the patents would end. Additionally, if PearlRiver Bio terminates the license agreement for convenience, it must transfer certain inventions, intellectual property, records and title and interest in and to regulatory filings rights back to Lead Discovery. In the event PearlRiver Bio terminates the license agreement due to a breach by Lead Discovery, PearlRiver Bio would retain a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable license to licensed technology to the extent necessary to enable the use of research results for the purpose of researching, developing, making, using, selling and importing products in the field.

Government Regulation
United States Food and Drug Administration Regulation
The FDA, and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with our vendors, collaboration partners, clinical research organizations (“CROs”), and CMOs, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate United States federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process or post-approval may subject an applicant to delays in development or approval, as well as administrative and judicial sanctions.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our product candidates are early-stage and have not been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States.
Our product candidates must be approved for therapeutic indications by the FDA before they may be marketed in the United States. For our drug product candidates regulated under the FDCA, FDA must approve a New Drug Application (“NDA”). For our biologic product candidates regulated under the FDCA and PHSA, FDA must approve a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). The process is similar and generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP, requirements;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually and when certain changes are made;


• | approval of the protocol and related documentation by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (GCP), requirements and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA after completion of all pivotal trials;


• | payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA or BLA (unless a fee waiver applies);


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product will be produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (cGMPs), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to ensure and preserve the drug or biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;


• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including, where applicable, consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.

Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials
Before testing any drug or biologic in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety and toxicology studies. In the United States, the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. In the United States, the IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a trial.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s 
control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable related to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
The FDA may, at any time during the initial 30-day IND review period or while clinical trials are ongoing under the IND, impose a partial or complete clinical hold based on concerns for patient safety and/or noncompliance with regulatory requirements. This order issued by the FDA would delay a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed, and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. Imposition of a clinical hold could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing planned clinical studies in a timely manner. In addition, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may recommend that the clinical trial be stopped if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. In the United States, information about applicable clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs and BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap.

• | Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product in a limited population of healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, evaluate the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.


• | Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.


• | Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA.

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human participants exposed to the drug or biologic and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the drug or biological characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life and to identify appropriate storage conditions for the product candidate.
FDA Marketing Application Review Process
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA (for a drug) or BLA (for a biologic) requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug, or the safety, purity and potency of the investigational biologic, to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), certain NDAs and BLAs and certain supplements to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient or clinically active component, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan within 60 days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA generally does not apply to a drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
In the United States, the FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs to ensure they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA makes a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the application. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards, including cGMP requirements, designed to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original NDA for a new molecular entity or BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original NDA for a new molecular entity or BLA filed for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions may be available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first 
application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA may refer an application for a drug or biologic to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter will usually describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA or BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA or BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety or efficacy after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patent registries. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without a REMS, if required. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation (“ODD”), to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater of than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States of that drug or biologic. ODD must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has received ODD and subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug or biologic for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years from the approval of the NDA or BLA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug 
exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received ODD. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval.
A new drug or biologic is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete upon satisfaction of certain conditions.
In addition, a new drug or biological product may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic, alone or in combination with or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track, or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for priority review. A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. For an original NDA for a new molecular entity and a BLA, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that generally provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over available treatments, and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM), that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
For drugs and biologics granted accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires sponsors to conduct, in a diligent manner, adequate and well-controlled post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies with due diligence, failure to confirm a clinical benefit during the post-approval studies, or dissemination of false or misleading promotional materials would allow the FDA to withdraw the product approval on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated approval are subject to prior review by the FDA unless the FDA informs the applicant otherwise.
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and priority review do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process.
Post-Approval Requirements for Drugs and Biologics in the United States
In the United States, drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe approved products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, including not only by Company employees but also by agents of the Company or those speaking on the Company’s behalf, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, including liabilities under the False Claims Act where products carry reimbursement under federal health care programs. Promotional materials for approved drugs and biologics must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug and biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our CMOs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug and biological products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information;


• | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;


• | holds on clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs.

Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
Certain products may be comprised of components that are regulated under separate regulatory authorities and by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. A combination product is comprised of a combination of a drug and a device; a biological product and a device; a drug and a biological product; or a drug, a device, and a biological product. Under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product includes:

• | a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;


• | two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products;


• | a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or


• | any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.

Under the FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product, which means the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product, i.e., the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product.
United States Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our future product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
Regulatory exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not 
previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 
The FDCA also provides three years of exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent for other conditions of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
In addition, both drugs and biologics can also obtain pediatric exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
United States Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively (“ACA”), signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCIA”), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars in the United States. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
Other United States Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Other United States Healthcare Laws
Healthcare providers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical manufactures to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which companies research, sell, market and distribute pharmaceutical products. In addition, transparency laws and patient privacy laws can apply to the activities of pharmaceutical manufactures. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that can affect a pharmaceutical company’s operations include without limitation:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but such exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection;


• | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the FCA, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement, including providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label, material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the federal government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;


• | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it;


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates as well as their covered subcontractors. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;


• | The federal legislation commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, covered manufacturers also are required to report information regarding their payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, and nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year;
• | Federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; 


• | Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and


• | Analogous state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations with respect to certain laws. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare 
companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future marketed products could materially affect our business in an adverse way. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. Ensuring our business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects companies to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs, contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Any action for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could cause a pharmaceutical company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business.
Health Reform
In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition to coverage under Medicare Part D for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:
•On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional action is taken by Congress. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, as well as subsequent legislation, these reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022. 
•On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
•On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
•On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
•On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
•On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services and result in reduced demand for certain pharmaceutical products or additional pricing pressures.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. presidential executive orders, congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
At the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Reimbursement
Sales of our products, when and if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:

• | a covered benefit under its health plan;


• | safe, effective and medically necessary;


• | appropriate for the specific patient;


• | cost-effective; and


• | neither experimental nor investigational.

In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS, which decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product candidate does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product candidate. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, coverage determination is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Further, coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of biosimilars for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made 
several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and reimbursement. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs and biologics is a time-consuming and costly process, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which a drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Assuming coverage is obtained for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of prescribed products.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
European Drug Development
In the EU, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. In April 2014, the EU adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The transitory provisions of the new Regulation offer sponsors the possibility to choose between the requirements of the previous Directive and the new Regulation if the request for authorization of a clinical trial is submitted in the year after the new Regulation became applicable. If the sponsor chooses to submit under the previous Directive, the clinical trial continues to be governed by the Directive until three years after the new Regulation became applicable. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years after the Regulation became applicable, the new Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The new Regulation will be directly applicable in all Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State), and aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the EU. The main characteristics of the new Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have also been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
We are in the process of applying to renew our status with EMA as a small and medium-sized enterprise (“SME”). If we obtain SME status with the EMA, it will provide access to administrative, regulatory and financial support, including fee reductions for scientific advice and regulatory procedures.
European Drug Review and Approval
In the EU, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization (MA). There are two main types of MAs:

• | The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of EU and the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (EMA). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as products produced by biotechnological processes, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a MA, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EU, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Concerned Member States).

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
European Data and Market Exclusivity
In the EU, innovative medicinal products (including both small molecules and biological medicinal products), sometimes referred to as new active substances, approved on the basis of a complete independent data package, generally qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon a MA and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed in the EU until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an MA for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained an MA based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
European orphan designation and exclusivity
In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are: (1) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition which; (2) either (a) affects no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, when the application is made or where it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition, or, if such a method exists, the product in question would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
In the EU, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing approval for the orphan medicinal product. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, an MA may only be granted to a “similar medicinal product” for the same therapeutic indication if: (i) a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the MA holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the MA holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or 
substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
European pediatric investigation plan
In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan (PIP), with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (PDCO), and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the product for which MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted an MA with the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP (even where such results are negative) are eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension (if any is in effect at the time of approval). In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
PRIME Designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority Medicines (PRIME), scheme is intended to encourage product development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation, where the MA application will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which where is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EU or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Applicants will typically be at the exploratory clinical trial phase of development, and will have preliminary clinical evidence in patients to demonstrate the promising activity of the medicine and its potential to address to a significant extent an unmet medical need. In exceptional circumstances, products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies, if compelling non-clinical data in a relevant model provide early evidence of promising activity, and first in man trials indicate adequate exposure for the desired pharmacotherapeutic effects and tolerability. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MA application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated EMA contact and rapporteur from the EMA’s CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.
Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained 
In case an MA for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the MA is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: 
•Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations. 
•The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards 
when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the European Union with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union.
•The marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of products and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU. 
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians or other health care professionals to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is usually governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.
Payments made to physicians or other healthcare professionals in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, and the UK officially withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the UK and the EU, the UK was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020 (Transition Period), during which EU rules continued to apply. However, the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current European Union regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. For example, the UK has implemented the now repealed Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). The extent to which the regulation of clinical trials in the UK will mirror the new Clinical Trials Regulation now that has come into effect is not yet known, however the MHRA has conducted a consultation on a set of proposals designed to improve and strengthen the United Kingdom clinical trials legislation.
Great Britain is no longer covered by the EU’s procedures for the grant of MAs (Northern Ireland will be covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can be covered as a CMS under the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures). A separate MA will be required to market drugs in Great Britain. All medicinal products with a valid centralized MA on January 1, 2021 were automatically converted into Great Britain MAs (unless the MA holder opted out of such a conversion). For two years from 1 January 2021, the UK’s regulator, the MHRA, may adopt decisions taken by the European Commission on the approval of new MAs through the centralized procedure, and the MHRA will have regard to MAs approved in a country in the European Economic Area (although in both cases an MA will only be granted if any Great Britain-specific requirements are met). This is known as the EC Decision Reliance Procedure. Various national procedures are now available to place a drug on the market in the UK, Great Britain, or Northern Ireland, with the main 
national procedure having a maximum timeframe of 150 days (excluding time taken to provide any further information or data required). The MHRA also offers a 150-day assessment timeline for all high quality applications for a UK, Great Britain or Northern Ireland MA. The 150 day timeline does not, however, include a “clock-off” period which may occur if issues arise or points require clarification following an initial assessment of the application. Such issues should be addressed within a 60-day period, although extensions may be granted in exceptional cases.
Since January 1, 2021, a separate process for orphan designation has applied in Great Britain. There is now no pre-MA orphan designation (as there is in the EU) in Great Britain and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of an MA application for a UK or Great Britain MA. The criteria for orphan designation are the same as in the European Union, save that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g., there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned in Great Britain, as opposed to the EU, and the prevalence of the condition must be no more than 5 in 10,000 person in Great Britain).
The UK has implemented the now repealed Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). The extent to which the regulation of clinical trials in the UK will mirror the new Clinical Trials Regulation now that has come into effect is not yet known, however the MHRA has conducted a consultation on a set of proposals designed to improve and strengthen the UK clinical trials legislation.
Personal Data Processing
The collection, use, transfer, disclosure, retention, security and other processing of personal data (including, without limitation, clinical trial data and other personal health data) (collectively, “Process” or “Processing”) may be subject to independent and overlapping data security and privacy regulatory frameworks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These frameworks are evolving and may impose potentially conflicting obligations. For example, in the EEA, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, which became effective May 25, 2018, governs the Processing of personal data. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that Process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers (such as clinical trial sponsors) of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct data protection impact assessments for “high risk” Processing, expanded the scope of rights data subjects can exercise, limitations on retention of personal data, special provisions for “sensitive information” including health and genetic information of data subjects, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data, like the U.S. Such transfers of personal data outside of the EEA require the use of a valid “transfer mechanism” and, in many cases, the implementation of supplementary technical, organizational and/or contractual measures (see below). Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to 20 million euros or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to request deletion of personal data in certain circumstances, and claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. 
In addition, further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR, the European Commission (“EC”) has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing. 
To enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA or the UK, adequate safeguards must be implemented in compliance with European and UK data protection laws. On June 4, 2021, the EC issued new forms of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA (or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to 
controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA (and not subject to the GDPR). The new standard contractual clauses replace the standard contractual clauses that were adopted previously under the EU Data Protection Directive. The UK is not subject to the EC’s new standard contractual clauses but has published a UK-specific transfer mechanism, the International Data Transfer Agreement, which will enable transfers from the UK. It is currently awaiting Parliamentary approval and is likely to enter into force on 21 March 2021. We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the EU and UK GDPR and doing so will require significant effort and cost.
In the United States, there are a broad variety of data protection laws and regulations that may apply to our activities such as state data breach notification laws, state personal data privacy laws (for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws. In California, the CCPA was enacted in June 2018, became effective on January 1, 2020, and became subject to enforcement by the California Attorney General's office on July 1, 2020. The CCPA broadly defines personal information, and creates new individual privacy rights and protections for California consumers (as defined in the law), places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. The CCPA requires covered business to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. While there is a broad exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA as well as clinical trial information, the CCPA may impact certain of our personal information processing activities if we become a "Business" regulated by the scope of the CCPA.
In addition to the CCPA, new privacy and data security laws have been proposed in more than half of the states in the U.S. and in the U.S. Congress, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which trend may accelerate depending on the new U.S. presidential administration. The effects of the CCPA, and other similar state or federal laws, are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply with such legislation.
Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations such as the GDPR, UK GDPR and CCPA will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place new or additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with current, evolving and new data protection requirements. This may be an onerous undertaking and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the EEA, the UK and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, privacy, information security, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Employees and Human Capital
As of March 1, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had an aggregate of 90 full-time employees and 109 contractors. A contractor is defined as anyone directly contracted for a certain number of hours or days or in respect of a particular project. This does not include anyone that is engaged on an ad-hoc basis or contracted through a CRO or other firm without a direct contract. 37 of our employees have M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Within our workforce, 47 employees are engaged in research and development and 43 are engaged in business development, finance, legal, and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase shareholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. We also seek to align the incentives of the operational teams at our subsidiaries with our business objectives by employing incentivization agreements with such individuals.
As a global company, much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds.
