ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview



Amerityre incorporated as a Nevada corporation on January 30, 1995.



Amerityre engages in the development, manufacture, and sale of solid polyurethane tires. We believe that we have developed unique polyurethane formulations that allow us to make products with superior performance characteristics, such as high abrasion resistance, increased energy efficiency, and higher load-bearing capabilities, when compared to conventional rubber tires and competitive flat free, polyurethane tires. We also believe that our manufacturing processes are more energy efficient than the traditional rubber tire manufacturing processes, in part because our polyurethane compounds do not require the multiple processing steps, extreme heat, and high pressure that are necessary to cure rubber. Using our polyurethane-based technologies, we produce tires that last longer, are less susceptible to failure and are friendlier to the environment than conventional rubber tires.
Products



Our polyurethane material technology is based on two main proprietary formulations; closed-cell polyurethane foam, a lightweight material with high load-bearing capabilities for low duty cycle applications, and Elastothane®, a high-performance polyurethane elastomer with high load-bearing capabilities for high duty applications. Closed cell foam tires and components accounted for the majority of fiscal year 2022 tire revenues. Our closed-cell polyurethane products are categorized as flat-free because they have no inner tube, do not require inflation and will not go flat, even if punctured. Our tires are virtually maintenance free, non-toxic, provide extended tire life, and offer superior energy efficiency compared to rubber based tires. Our marketing efforts are divided among the following distinct segments:

● | Bicycle Tires
--+--------------


● | Light duty Industrial Vehicles (Golf Carts, Stock Chasers)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Lawn and Garden tires
--+----------------------


● | Handtruck and small cart tires
--+-------------------------------


● | Agricultural Carts
--+-------------------


● | Forklift Tires
--+---------------


● | Mobility Tires
--+---------------


● | Custom application tires
--+-------------------------




Our business model focuses our resources on applications and opportunities where our advantages in product technology and tire performance give us an opportunity to obtain premium pricing. The majority of our sales are to North American customers as international sales are adversely affected by high freight costs and more recently a strong dollar that creates an unfavorable exchange rate versus other currencies.



Closed-Cell Polyurethane Foam Tires



We currently manufacture closed-cell polyurethane foam tires for bicycles, golf and baggage carts, hand trucks, lawn and garden equipment, wheelbarrows, personnel carriers, and medical mobility products, as well as custom designed applications.  Our proprietary formulations produce foam tires that enjoy a market reputation of superior quality and performance relative to competitor offerings.



Our efforts in custom product development and marketing allow us to build customer relationships and expand sales with original equipment manufacturers and tire distributors. We continue our focus on creating unique product solutions for customers with specific tire performance requirements. The demand for our larger tires, including golf cart, personnel carrier and baggage cart tires, reached record levels during the year ended June 30, 2022. Our results were achieved despite the headwinds of higher material costs, supply chain disruptions, and adverse fiscal policies introduced by the government to fight inflation Since the inception of the pandemic in March 2020, Amerityre has operated as an “essential business”. We have seen strong demand for our products that continue to increase, resulting in strong record level sales revenues in Q4 of fiscal year 2022 and for the entire fiscal year 2022.

Polyurethane Elastomer Industrial Tires



We have developed solid polyurethane industrial tires made of Elastothane®, our family of proprietary polyurethane elastomer formulations.  We currently offer over 20 sizes for Class 1, 4 and 5 forklifts, as well as elastomer tires for scissor lifts. Our Elastothane® 500 material, a lighter density formulation than our standard polyurethane elastomer, continues to be well received by the agricultural applications market. Common applications for this formulation are baggage carts, personnel carriers, stock chasers, and lawn mowers, applications where enhanced abrasion resistance and increased weight bearing capacity is required. Our polyurethane elastomer tires are superior to rubber tires as they are non-marking, more energy efficient, carry greater load weight, are made of non-toxic materials, operate in lower temperature environments and have longer comparative service life.  Our initiatives to develop joint products with OEM partners is key to long-term success in this market segment.



Amerityre offers elastomer-based products for the agricultural tire market, such as flat-free pivot tires used in irrigation systems, seeder tires, and hay baler tires. As farm incomes have improved during fiscal year 2022 due to higher agricultural commodity pricing, we have seen higher sales of these agricultural tires. However, we continue to believe that the market opportunity in this segment is substantial, and we continue to pursue partnerships to take advantage of joint product development and marketing opportunities in these market segments.



Raw Materials and Supplies



The two principal chemical raw materials required to develop our proprietary formulations used in the manufacture of our products are known generically as polyols and isocyanates.  We also purchase various chemical additives that are blended with the polyols and isocyanates.  We maintain multiple sources for chemical raw materials, where possible, to assure adequate supply and competitive pricing. The quality of our raw materials is critical to the superior performance of our proprietary formulations.



During Q4 of the year ended June 30, 2022, the availability of chemical raw materials improved, and material pricing stabilized. Since our chemical raw materials are mainly sourced domestically, we have been able to avoid many of the supply chain problems that currently plague other manufacturers. We have been able to reduce our quoted lead times for tire shipments to our standard of 2 weeks or less. While availability of materials has improved, we expect the costs for these materials to continue to increase, as general inflation in the US economy impacts all of our costs.



In addition to the chemical raw materials, we purchase steel and plastic wheel components for use in tire assemblies.  We purchase these components from domestic and overseas suppliers.  A significant increase in sales of our 18 x 8.50 tire assemblies in the year ended June 30, 2022 has resulted in the requirement for more 12” x 7” rim shipments from our Chinese supplier. We continue to be impacted by the tariffs on Chinese goods, and freight costs are still high, although we expect the freight costs increases to moderate as the overall slowing US economy eases demand for Chinese shipping services. However, our future business plan does not assume significant material cost decreases from current levels. 



Operations/Manufacturing



Our closed-cell polyurethane foam and elastomer products are primarily manufactured utilizing multiple–stationed, carousel molding machines.  We produce closed-cell foam products by pouring a proprietary polyurethane formula into a mold.  The molding process occurs by reacting monomeric diphenylmethanediisocyanate (MDI) with polyol and other chemicals.  The reaction causes a cross linking of the chemicals, which cures into a solid foam. The closed-cell polyurethane foam or elastomer product is then removed from the mold and the process is repeated.



All our products are inspected prior to shipment to ensure quality.  Any products considered defective by our quality control personnel are disposed of through traditional refuse disposal services.  All our tires are manufactured at our Boulder City, Nevada facility. Due to increased demand for our products we have been running overtime shifts. We expect this level of overtime to decrease in fiscal year 2023 if the US economy slows as forecasted. During fiscal year 2022 we upgraded the electronic control systems of our 3 polyurethane pouring machines. Our major capital investment for fiscal year 2023 will likely include the refurbishment of our two production carousel systems. This investment will increase the manufacturing reliability of these machines.



Information Systems



We use commercial computer aided design (CAD) and finite element analysis (FEA) software tools in the engineering and design of our products.  This software allows us to integrate our proprietary manufacturing and production data with our design technology, enabling us to leverage our previous manufacturing and test results to predict the performance characteristics of new product designs and product improvements.  For general business purposes, we use commercially available software for financial, distribution, manufacturing, customer relationships and payroll management. Our computer system is protected by commercially available security and antivirus software.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution



Amerityre utilizes independent manufacturer representatives with tire industry experience to promote and sell our products. These independent sales professionals complement our in-house sales department in Boulder City. The majority of our sales is direct to OEMs or sold to tire distributors who in turn sell to individual end users. We sell to individual consumers through our website, which was originally designed to be a marketing and educational tool for current and potential customers. However, direct sales through our website continues to grow. All product shipments originate directly from our manufacturing facility in Boulder City, Nevada.



Internationally, we have several distribution partners located in Canada, Australia, and Europe. We continue to seek additional international sales and marketing partners to expand the worldwide sales and distribution of our products.



Customers



Amerityre has a diversified customer base, providing tires and assemblies to OEMs, distributors, equipment dealers, and individuals. Our largest OEM customer accounted for approximately 27% of our sales for fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, and 28% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. We expect sales with this customer to continue to remain strong as their business is forecast to continue to grow in fiscal year 2023. Our customers include OEMs of lawn and garden, agricultural, and mobility, and outdoor power equipment, as well as regional tire distributors, retail cooperatives, agricultural tire distributors, and retailers of lawn and garden tires, bicycle tires and hand truck tires. Our brand awareness among consumers grows as we enlarge our customer base and engage new OEMs and distributors.
Competition



There are companies that produce not-for-highway-use or light-duty tires from polyurethane foam such as Greentyre, who manufactures in the UK; Carefree Tire, who manufactures in China; Marastar (a division of Carlstar), who manufactures in China. Custom Engineered Wheels and Krypton Industries, who manufacture in India.  We believe our closed-cell polyurethane foam tires are superior to the polyurethane foam tires offered by these competitors. Our closed cell technology gives our products higher load bearing characteristics than competitor tire products that have open-cell polyurethane foam, while producing a ride quality comparable to a properly inflated pneumatic tire. We believe we are the largest USA-based manufacturer of polyurethane, flat free tires.



In addition to manufacturers of polyurethane foam tires, we compete directly with companies that manufacture and market traditional not-for-highway-use, low-duty pneumatic, semi-pneumatic, and solid tires made from rubber.  The not-for-highway use tire industry historically has been highly competitive, and most of these competitors have financial resources that substantially exceed ours. In addition, many of our competitors are very large companies, such as Kenda, Taiwan; Maxxis International, Taiwan; Cheng Shin, China; and Carlstar, USA.  These competitors have established brand name recognition, distribution networks for their products, and have some consumer loyalty to their products, although price is a major factor for their customers when making the buying decision.



Despite the presence of larger competitors, we believe that the performance of our superior proprietary formulations gives us some competitive advantages in certain market segments. We produce the only flat free polyurethane foam tires in the bicycle tire, golf cart tire, and personnel carrier tire market segments. The performance advantage of our formulation is evident in these market segments, where load bearing capability and ride quality is important. Consequently, we have focused our attention and sales and marketing resources on these product segments.



In the agricultural tire market, the market leaders are Titan International and Carlisle, global manufacturers of agriculture pneumatic tire and wheel assemblies.  The economic landscape in the agricultural sector appears to be improving as commodity crop prices have significantly increased. We expect spending in the agricultural space to increase during fiscal year 2023, although this spend might be tempered if the US economy slows as expected, we continue to pursue partnerships with OEMs in the agricultural equipment market space to promote our products and increase our agricultural tire sales.
