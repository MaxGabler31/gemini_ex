ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
MariMed Inc. (the “Company”) is a multi-state operator in the United States cannabis industry. The Company develops, operates, manages, and optimizes over 300,000 square feet of state-of-the-art, regulatory-compliant facilities for the cultivation, production and dispensing of medicinal and recreational cannabis. The Company also licenses its proprietary brands of cannabis and hemp-infused products, along with other top brands, in several domestic markets and overseas.
 
Upon its entry into the cannabis industry in 2014, the Company was an advisory firm that procured state-issued cannabis licenses on behalf of its clients, developed cannabis facilities which it leased to these newly-licensed companies, and provided industry-leading expertise and oversight in all aspects of their cannabis operations. The Company also provided its clients with ongoing regulatory, accounting, real estate, human resources, and administrative services.
 
Over the last few years, the Company made the strategic decision to transition from a consulting business to a direct owner and operator of cannabis licenses in high-growth states. Core to this transition is the acquisition and consolidation of the Company’s clients (the “Consolidation Plan”). Among several benefits, the Consolidation Plan would present a simpler, more transparent financial picture of the full breadth of the Company’s efforts, with a clearer representation of the revenues, earnings, and other financial metrics the Company has generated for its clients. The Company has played a key role in the successes of these entities, from the securing of their cannabis licenses, to the development of facilities that are models of excellence, to funding their operations, and to providing operational and corporate guidance. Accordingly, the Company believes it is well suited to own these businesses and manage the continuing growth of their operations.
 
To date, the acquisition and consolidation of the Company’s client businesses in Massachusetts and Illinois have been completed. The acquisition of a client business in Maryland has been contracted, and the Company is awaiting approval by the Maryland Cannabis Control Commission, which is pending. Upon approval, this entity will be consolidated. The acquisitions of the remaining businesses located in Nevada and Delaware are at various stages of completion and subject to each state’s laws governing the ownership transfer of cannabis licenses and other closing conditions. Delaware will require a modification of current cannabis ownership laws to permit for-profit ownership, which is expected to occur when the state legalizes recreational adult-use cannabis. Until the law changes and the acquisition is approved, the Company continues to generate revenue from rental income, management fees, and licensing royalties.
 
The transition to a fully integrated muti-state cannabis operator (“MSO”) is part of a strategic growth plan (the “Strategic Growth Plan”) the Company is implementing to drive its revenues and profitability. The Strategic Growth Plan has four components: (i) complete the Consolidation Plan, (ii) increase revenues in existing states, by spending capital to increase the Company’s cultivation and production capacity, and develop additional assets within those states, (iii) expand the Company’s footprint in additional legal cannabis states through new applications and acquisitions of existing cannabis businesses, and (iv) optimize the Company’s brand portfolio and licensing revenue by expanding into additional states with legal cannabis programs.
 
The Company has created its own brands of cannabis flower, concentrates, and precision-dosed products utilizing proprietary strains and formulations. These products are developed by the Company in cooperation with state-licensed operators who meet the Company’s strict quality standards, including all natural—not artificial or synthetic—ingredients. The Company licenses its brands and product formulations only to certified manufacturing professionals who follow state cannabis laws and adhere to the Company’s precise scientific formulations and product recipes.
 
The Company markets its high-quality cannabis flowers and concentrates under the award-winning1 Nature’s Heritage brand; cannabis-infused chewable tables and powder drink mixes under the brand names Kalm Fusion and K Fusion; all natural fruit chews under the award-winning1 Betty’s Eddies brand; and brownies, cookies, and other social sweets under the Bubby’s Baked brand. The Company’s cannabis-infused brands have been top-selling products in Maryland and Massachusetts.2 The Company intends to introduce additional product lines under these brands in the foreseeable future.
 
The Company also has strategic alliances with prominent brands. The Company has partnered with renowned ice cream maker Emack & Bolio’s® to create a line-up of cannabis-infused vegan and dairy ice cream. Additionally, the Company has secured distribution rights for the Binske® line of cannabis products crafted from premium artisan ingredients, the Healer line of medical full-spectrum cannabis tinctures, and the clinically-tested medicinal cannabis strains developed in Israel by global medical cannabis research pioneer Tikun Olam.


The Company’s operations have improved significantly over the past year as reflected in the following financial highlights:
 

● | Revenues increased 139% to approximately $121.5 million in 2021 from $50.9 million in 2020;

The Company’s strengths can be summarized as follows:
 
Professional Management
 
The Company’s management is one of the most experienced and long-tenured in the cannabis industry. It has had considerable success creating and growing business in the industry by successfully applying for cannabis licenses on behalf of its clients, overseeing the development of such clients’ cannabis operations and security plans, sourcing real estate for cannabis facilities in receptive municipalities, raising capital to purchase and develop facilities, and adhering operations to regulations established by individual state governments, including all environmental and social governance requirements. The knowledge and experience of the Company’s management provides a solid platform for the Company’s direct ownership through consolidation of the organic businesses it developed and for expansion to other opportunities in other cannabis-legal states.


Development of State-of-the-Art Cannabis Facilities and Operations
 
The Company has developed state-of-the-art cannabis cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in multiple states utilizing the Company’s proprietary practices and implementing industry best practices. Its facilities are examples of operational excellence under the Company’s proven management policies and processes.
 
Cannabis Brand Creation
 
The Company has developed unique brands of precision-dosed cannabis-infused products which are currently licensed and distributed in cannabis-legal states. The Company intends to continue expanding both its brand portfolio and the licensing of its branded products into additional cannabis-legal states and overseas.
Technological and Scientific Innovation
 
The Company is diligent in identifying and reviewing the latest sciences and processes applicable to the cultivation, distillation, production, packaging, securing, and distribution of cannabis and cannabis-infused products. The Company has obtained the highest quality cannabis strains and genetics. It is at the leading edge of patient education and physician outreach for cannabis, and it seeks strategic relationships with companies that are at the forefront of extraction and distillation.
Education and Knowledge Sharing
 
The rapid growth of the legal cannabis market presents a global paradigm shift and challenges to medical professionals and consumers who seek scientific knowledge and research regarding the medical benefits of cannabis. The Company provides educational research and studies on its brands and products to its growing community of healthcare professionals and consumers. As cannabis becomes more mainstream, medical providers will need to be educated on how to prescribe or make recommendations to their patients, and consumers will need to learn how to gain the most benefit from certain strains, genetics, or formulations.
 
As part of its education initiative, the Company intends to assemble a Scientific Advisory Board (the “SAB”) that will include knowledgeable medical practitioners and researchers focused on the scientific application of cannabis for health and wellness. The SAB’s goals will include the development of strategies to address the most widespread and debilitating medical and dietary conditions through the utilization of cannabis- and hemp-based therapies.

Consolidation Plan
 
The Company’s Consolidation Plan consists of the strategic decision to acquire and consolidate client cannabis businesses it developed, and in some instances managed and advised, in Massachusetts, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, and Delaware. When completed, the businesses that are acquired and consolidated will be reported in the Company’s financial statements. The following is a summary of the Company’s progress towards its Consolidation Plan.
Massachusetts
 
In December 2018, the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission (the “MCCC”) approved the conversion of ARL Healthcare Inc. (“ARL”), the Company’s cannabis-licensed client, from a non-profit entity to a for-profit corporation and the transfer of ownership to the Company. ARL holds cannabis licenses for cultivation, production and dispensing.
 
The Company operates (i) a 10,000 square foot dispensary, developed within its 22,700 square foot property in Middleboro that received approval from the MCCC to commence operations in December 2019, and (ii) a 70,000 square foot cultivation and production facility, developed within its 138,000 square foot property in New Bedford that received approval from the MCCC to commence operations in January 2020. The Company intends to expand the cultivation and production facility throughout the balance of the property in 2023.
 
The Company entered into an agreement to acquire a second dispensary in Beverly in early 2022, and expects to complete the buildout and commence operations, subject to approval by the MCCC, by the summer of 2022.
Illinois
 
In October 2019, the Illinois Department of Financial & Professional Regulation approved the Company’s acquisition of KPG of Anna LLC and KPG of Harrisburg LLC, the Company’s two cannabis-licensed clients that operate Company-built and -owned medical cannabis dispensaries in the state of Illinois (both entities collectively, the “KPGs”). As part of this transaction, the Company also acquired the selling parties’ interests in Mari Holdings IL LLC (“Mari-IL”), the Company’s subsidiary which owns the real estate in which the KPGs’ dispensaries are located.


Effective October 1, 2019, 100% of the operations of these entities have been consolidated into the Company’s financial statements. Additionally, on January 1, 2020, the state of Illinois legalized recreational adult-use cannabis, allowing the Company to operate both medical and recreational adult-use programs in the Anna and Harrisburg dispensaries. A third recreational dispensary was opened in this state in Mt. Vernon in September 2020, and a fourth recreational dispensary was opened in Metropolis in May 2021.
 
Maryland
 
In 2016, the Company and the members of Kind Therapeutics USA Inc., the Company’s client in Maryland that holds licenses for the cultivation, production, and dispensing of medical cannabis (“Kind”), agreed to a partnership/joint venture whereby Kind would be owned 70% by the Company and 30% by the members of Kind, subject to approval by the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (“MMCC”). In reliance thereon, the Company purchased, designed, and developed a 180,000 square foot cultivation and production facility in Hagerstown, MD for occupancy and use by Kind, which became operational in late 2017, and the Company further agreed to manage and finance all aspects of Kind’s cannabis business, as Kind had no background or experience in the industry.
 
In 2018, prior to finalizing the documents confirming the partnership/joint venture, the Company and the members of Kind negotiated and entered into a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) for the Company to acquire 100% of the membership interests of Kind. Also at that time, the parties entered into a management services agreement for the Company to provide Kind with comprehensive management services in connection with the business and operations of Kind, and a 20-year lease agreement for Kind’s utilization of the Company’s Hagerstown facility. Additionally, in 2019, the Company purchased a 9,000 square foot building in Anne Arundel County which is to be developed into a dispensary to be leased to Kind.


In 2019, the members of Kind sought to renegotiate the terms of the MOU and subsequently sought to renege on both the original partnership/joint venture and the MOU. The Company engaged with the members of Kind in good faith in an attempt to reach updated terms acceptable to both parties, however the members of Kind failed to reciprocate in good faith, resulting in an impasse. Incrementally, both parties through counsel further sought to resolve the impasse, however such initiative resulted in both parties commencing legal proceedings.
 
In December 2021, the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with the members of Kind to acquire 100% of the equity ownership of Kind in exchange for $13,500,000 payable in cash (subject to adjustment) and $6,500,000 payable by the issuance of four-year 6.0% promissory notes to the members of Kind. The notes shall be secured by a first priority lien on the Company’s property in Hagerstown, MD. Upon execution of the membership interest purchase agreement, the Company deposited, in escrow, the sum of $5,000,000 as a contract down-payment.
 
Simultaneously, the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with one of the members of Kind to acquire such member’s entire equity ownership interest in (i) Mari Holdings MD LLC (“Mari-MD”), the Company’s majority owned subsidiary that owns production and retail cannabis facilities in Hagerstown, MD and Annapolis, MD, and (ii) Mia Development LLC (“Mia”), the Company’s majority owned subsidiary that owns production and retail cannabis facilities in Wilmington, DE. The purchase price for the interests in Mari-MD and Mia is $2,000,000 in the aggregate, payable in cash. Giving effect to the purchase of these interests, the Company will own approximately 99.7% and 94.3%, respectively, of Mari-MD and Mia.
 
The closings under the foregoing agreements are subject to the fulfilment of closing conditions including, but not limited to, approval by the MMCC, which is pending. There is no assurance that the approval of the MMCC will be obtained or that the further closing conditions will be met. Simultaneous with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the foregoing agreements, the aforementioned litigation between the parties will be dismissed. For further information, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this report.


Nevada
 
In 2019, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the ownership interests of The Harvest Foundation LLC (“Harvest”), its cannabis-licensed client. Harvest holds both medical and adult-use cannabis cultivation licenses, and operates in a 10,000 square foot cannabis cultivation facility developed with the Company. Upon the approval of the transaction by the state authority, and the fulfillment of other closing conditions, the ownership of Harvest will be transferred to the Company, and the operations of Harvest will begin to be consolidated into the Company’s financial statements. There is no assurance that the closing  conditions to the Company’s acquisition of Harvest, including approval by the state authority, will be achieved or that the acquisition will be consummated
Delaware
 
Delaware’s current cannabis program is for medical use only, and requires license holders to be not-for-profit entities. The Company provides comprehensive management and real estate services to First State Compassion Center (“FSCC”), its cannabis-licensed client in this state. The Company’s validated cannabis experience was instrumental in FSCC being granted Delaware’s first ever seed-to-sale medical cannabis license, and two of the four statewide licenses.
 
FSCC leases the Company-developed 47,000 square foot seed-to-sale facility in Wilmington and the Company’s 4,000 square foot leased retail location in Lewes which the Company developed into a cannabis dispensary. In 2019, the Company signed a lease with an option to purchase a 100,000 square foot building in Milford, which it is currently developing into a second cultivation and production facility for FSCC.
 
The Delaware medical program has grown to over 10,000 licensed medical patients. FSCC, under the Company’s management, is currently operating two of the six cannabis licenses in the state. The additional cultivation and production facility in Milford will bring a much-needed supply of product to a state where demand continues to outpace supply.
 
The state is expected to allow “for-profit” ownership of cannabis licenses when the state legalizes recreational adult-use cannabis, at which time the Company will seek to acquire FSCC and obtain ownership of the licenses and operations, subject to state approval.
 
Rhode Island
 
Rhode Island currently has a medical cannabis program where license holders must be not-for-profit entities. Previous discussions held by the Company to potentially acquire a licensed cannabis asset are currently suspended.

Corporate History
 
The Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware in January 2011 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Worlds Inc. under the name Worlds Online Inc., which was later spun-off to its stockholders. At its inception, Worlds Online Inc. operated online virtual environments. In 2014, the Company transitioned its operational focus to the emerging cannabis industry and led the effort to win the cannabis license in Delaware on behalf of its client. To date, the Company has won a total of 17 cannabis licenses on behalf of itself and its cannabis clients.
 
The following is a summary of the Company’s history over the past three calendar years:
 
In June 2019, the Company acquired a 70% ownership interest of MediTaurus LLC, a company established by Jokubas Ziburkas PhD, a neuroscientist and leading authority on hemp-based CBD and the endocannabinoid system. MediTaurus operates in the United States and Europe and has developed proprietary CBD formulations sold under its Florance™ brand. In September 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 30% ownership interest of MediTaurus.
 
In October 2019, the Company closed on the purchase of a 9,000 square foot building in Annapolis, MD which it is developing into a medical cannabis dispensary that the Company expects to be completed by June 2022.
 
In October 2019, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation approved the Company’s acquisition of the KPGs and Mari-IL, and as of such date, the KPGs and Mari-IL became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company.
 
In January 2020, the Illinois legalized adult-use cannabis, which was added to the Company’s two existing cannabis licenses, thereby increasing the Company’s operations in Illinois to service both medical and recreational cannabis consumers.
 
In February 2020, the Company purchased a 4,800 square foot stand-alone retail building in Mt Vernon, IL which it developed into a state-approved adult-use cannabis dispensary that opened in September 2020.
 
In July 2020, the Company refinanced a mortgage secured by its properties in Massachusetts generating proceeds of $13.0 million that were used to pay down the initial mortgage and short-term promissory notes.
 
In February 2021, the Company entered into a five-year lease agreement for a 12,000 square foot premises located in Wilmington, DE which the Company developed into a cannabis production facility with offices, and subleases to its cannabis-licensed client in this state.
 
In March 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Hadron Healthcare Master Fund with respect to a financing facility of up to $46.0 million in exchange for newly-designated Series C convertible preferred stock of the Company and warrants to purchase the Company’s common stock. The initial proceeds of $23.0 million from the facility were used to pay down debt, and is being used to upgrade certain of the Company’s owned and managed facilities. A portion of the balance of the facility is available to fund the Kind acquisition, provided such acquisition is consummated, including obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals, no later than the end of 2022.
 
In May 2021, the Company opened its fourth adult-use dispensary in Illinois in the city of Metropolis. The Company had been renting this 14,000 square foot premises since January 2021, which it developed into a state-approved cannabis dispensary in early 2021. In July 2021 the Company purchased the premises.


In August 2021, the Company entered into a manufacturing and royalty agreement with renown ice cream brand Emack & Bolio’s® whereby the companies will collaborate to create a line-up of cannabis-infused vegan and dairy ice cream containing the Company’s full spectrum of natural cannabinoids and terpenes. This new category of cannabis products is expected to debut in Massachusetts during 2022, followed by launches in other cannabis-legal markets.


In November 2021, in order to quality for applying to a cannabis dispensary license lottery in Ohio, the Company entered into short-term lease agreements for six retail properties in this state, each property between 4,000 and 6,000 square feet and with a lease term of eleven months. Should the Company be awarded one or more cannabis licenses, it can extend the term of one or more of the lease agreements to ten years (with options to further extend), and develop the premises of such extended leases into cannabis dispensaries. In early 2022, the Company was notified that it was awarded a license, and is awaiting the final verification process to be completed by the state.


In November 2021, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the cannabis license, property lease, and other assets and rights of, and to assume the liabilities and operating obligations associated with a cannabis dispensary that is currently operating in Beverly, MA. The purchase is contingent upon the approval of the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission, which is expected by the summer of 2022.

In December 2021, the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the equity ownership of Kind, the Company’s cannabis-licensed client that holds licenses for the cultivation, production and dispensing of medical cannabis in Maryland. The Company is currently waiting for approval of this acquisition from the MMCC, which is pending. Upon approval, the acquisition of Kind will be consummated, Kind’s financial results will begin to be consolidated into the Company’s financial statements, and the pending litigation between the parties will be dismissed.


Simultaneous with the Kind membership interest purchase agreement, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a former owner of Kind’s equity ownership interests in (i) Mari Holdings MD LLC (“Mari-MD”), the Company’s majority owned subsidiary that owns production and retail cannabis facilities in Hagerstown, MD and Annapolis, MD, and (ii) Mia Development LLC (“Mia”), the Company’s majority owned subsidiary that owns production and retail cannabis facilities in Wilmington, DE. The acquisition of these interests will be consummated simultaneous with the closing of the Kind acquisition. Giving effect to the purchase of these interests, the Company will own approximately 99.7% and 94.3%, respectively, of Mari-MD and Mia.


Recent Developments
 
In January 2022, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the ownership interests of Green Growth Group Inc., an entity that has been awarded a craft grow cannabis license issued by the Illinois Department of Agriculture (“IDA”) for cultivation, production, and transporting of cannabis and cannabis-infused products in Illinois. The purchase price of $3,400,000 shall be comprised of $1,900,000 in cash and shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $1,500,000. The acquisition is conditioned upon the approval by the IDA, among other closing conditions, which is expected to occur by July 2022.


Also in January 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase a 30-acre parcel of land located in Mt. Vernon, IL containing a 33,000 square foot manufacturing facility and a 13,000 square foot storage warehouse, in exchange for $1,495,000 in cash. Upon execution of the agreement, the Company provided a deposit of $100,000 to the seller. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, after the Company has performed a complete inspection and feasibility review. If such review determines that the premises will not satisfy the Company’s requirements, the Company shall have the right to terminate the agreement with no other obligation other than the loss of the deposit.


In February 2022, the Company was notified that it was awarded a cannabis dispensary license from the state of Ohio, and is awaiting the final verification process to be completed by the state.

Competition
 
The Company’s goal is to become a fully integrated MSO of seed-to-sale cannabis operations. The Company is different than some of the other MSOs in that it has organically developed its client businesses from the bottom up, built its own brands and branded products, and has retained its core management team from inception. Other MSOs have raised significantly more capital, including on the Canadian Securities Exchange, and acquired assets in more states than the Company has to date.
 
Additionally, while the Company has a comprehensive suite of products and services for the cannabis industry, it faces competition from companies of varying sizes and geographic reach, who produce and sell similar products. Some of these companies provide a subset of the Company’s product and service offerings, while others are able to provide an equivalent level of the products and services offered by the Company. The Company, using its best practices and operational expertise, is able to produce cannabis products at one of the lowest cost structures in the industry which enables the Company to remain competitive in its markets. That said, the Company’s sales could be reduced significantly if its competitors develop and market products that are more effective, more convenient, or are less expensive than its products.
 
Going forward, as cannabis products become more mainstream and have greater acceptance, it is likely that larger and more established companies, with greater available resources including name recognition and national distribution networks, will enter the field. However, the Company believes that there are many barriers to entry and that to duplicate its licenses, know how, and facilities would take years at a great expense. At the same time, the Company believes the emerging cannabis industry is growing at such a pace that there are more opportunities available than current cannabis businesses can support. The Company is upgrading its marketing efforts to expand branding and distribution, as well as database marketing, home delivery, and business tactics developed by more conventional industries that will be important to the cannabis industry as it becomes more mainstream.
