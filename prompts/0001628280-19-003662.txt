These forward‑looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of our management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic, regulatory and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward‑looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change.
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward‑looking statements:

• | General economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected;


• | Competition among depository and other financial institutions;


• | Inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields or reduce the fair value of financial instruments;


• | Changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;


• | Our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities;

• | Changes in our organization, compensation and benefit plans;


• | Our ability to retain key employees;


• | Changes in the level of government support for housing finance;


• | Significant increases in our loan losses


• | Weaknesses in internal control; and


• | Changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own.

Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward‑looking statements.
WCF Bancorp, Inc.
WCF Bancorp, Inc., an Iowa corporation (the Company), was organized in March 2016. Upon completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion of WCF Financial, M.H.C. (the MHC) in July 2016, the Company became the registered savings and loan holding company of WCF Financial Bank (the Bank) and succeeded to all of the business and operations of Webster City Federal Bancorp (the Old Bancorp), 
4

a federal corporation, and each of Webster City Federal Bancorp and the MHC ceased to exist. Since the completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion, the Company has not engaged in any significant business activity other than owning the common stock of WCF Financial Bank and making a loan to the Bank's Employee Stock Ownership Plan. In connection to the Bank's conversion to an Iowa commercial bank charter, in June 2018, the Company became a bank holding company and continues to be examined by the Federal Reserve Board. Our executive office is located at 401 Fair Meadow Drive, Webster City, Iowa, and our telephone number at that address is (515) 832-3071.
WCF Financial Bank
WCF Financial Bank converted to and became a State of Iowa-chartered commercial bank in 2018. This is the first step in taking a stronger commercial focus in the markets that we serve. WCF Financial Bank was formally a federal savings association that was chartered and began operations in 1934, and has operated in Webster City, Iowa without interruption since that date. In January 2014 we completed our acquisition of Independence Federal Bank for Savings. We operate our banking business at our main office in Webster City, Iowa, and one full-service branch in Independence, Iowa. We believe our locations are strategically positioned within the State of Iowa along Highway 20, covering the central and eastern portions of the state.
We are engaged primarily in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in real estate loans secured by one-to-four-family residences. To a lesser extent we also originate consumer loans and non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate and commercial real estate loans. We are now emphasizing commercial loans as part of our product lineup. This coincides with adding commercial expertise to our bank staff and the desire to build a commercial loan structure to grow the bank. Our primary lending area is broader than our primary deposit market area and includes north central and northeastern Iowa. We also invest in securities. Our revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and securities, and from loan origination and fees. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the FHLB). As an Iowa-chartered commercial bank, we are regulated by the Iowa Division of Banking and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). We maintain strong relationships with our regulators in order to provide the depositors and shareholders a strong and secure institution.

Market Area
We conduct our operations from our two offices located in Webster City, Iowa and Independence, Iowa. Webster City is the county seat for Hamilton County, Iowa, and Independence is the county seat of Buchanan County, Iowa. We consider Hamilton County and Buchanan County, Iowa, and the surrounding contiguous counties, to be our primary market area. 
Hamilton County is located 60 miles north, and Buchanan County is 125 miles northeast, of Des Moines, Iowa. Both counties consist primarily of small towns and rural areas. According to S&P Global the total populations for Hamilton and Buchanan County in 2017 were 15,115 and 21,202, respectively. The population in Hamilton County has decreased between the years 2010 to 2017, with a population growth rate of (0.5)% annually, while the population in Buchanan County has increased between the years 2010 
5

to 2017, with a population growth rate of 0.17% annually. The average median household income in 2017 for Hamilton County was $55,836, while the average median income in 2017 for Buchanan County was $59,348. By contrast, the national level of median household income in 2017 was $57,652. By 2023, the projected increases in household income are expected to be 13.2% for Hamilton County and 6% for Buchanan County. 
The economy of our market area is heavily dependent on farming and agriculture. The major employers in our market area include the Van Diest Supply Company and the Van Diest Medical Center, Webster City Community School District, John Deere, Pries Enterprises, Wapsie Valley Creamery, and Buchanan County Health Center.
Competition
We face intense competition in our market areas and from the internet both in making loans and attracting deposits. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds and insurance companies. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. 
Lending Activities
Our primary lending activity is the origination of one-to-four family residential real estate loans. To a lesser extent, we also originate consumer loans and non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans (which we sometimes refer to as one-to-four family investment property loans). On a very limited basis, we have originated commercial real estate and land loans.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. We make loans according to written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors. The consumer loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and value of the property that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower’s ability to repay, we review the borrower’s employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower. We require “full documentation” on all of our loan applications. The commercial loan approval process has developed underwriting standards that are standard in the commercial industry and promote sound quality standards for the institution. 
Our policies and loan approval limits are established by the board of directors. The management team internally has loan authority up to $1,000,000. Loans above $1,000,000 require the Board of Director loan committee approval. Loans not requiring Board of Director loan committee approval are reviewed and confirmed at the Board Meeting the following month. 
We require appraisals of all real property securing commercial real estate, one-to-four family residential real estate loans and non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans. All appraisers are state-licensed or state-certified appraisers, and are approved by the board of directors annually.
One-to-Four Family Residential Real Estate Loans. Our primary lending consists of originating and purchasing owner occupied, one-to-four family residential real estate loans, substantially all of which are primarily secured by properties located in Hamilton, Linn and Buchanan Counties in Iowa. At December 31, 2018, $52.3 million, or 81.4% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of owner-occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans. We offer these loans with fixed-rate maturities of up to 30 years as well as adjustable rates. In recent years, in the historically low interest rate environment, nearly all of our 
7

one-to-four family residential real estate loan originations have had fixed-rates of interest. The average loan balance of our one-to-four family residential real estate loans at December 31, 2018 was $59,000. 
One-to-four family residential real estate loans are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate one-to-four family residential real estate loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which is generally $484,350 for single-family homes. We maintain in our portfolio all of the loans that we originate, except we currently sell most fixed-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans with maturities of greater than 15 years.
Our adjustable-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans generally consist of loans with initial interest rates fixed for one, three, five or seven years, and annual adjustments thereafter are indexed based on changes in the Monthly Federal Cost of Funds Index. Our adjustable-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans generally have an interest rate adjustment limit of 200 basis points per adjustment, with a maximum lifetime interest rate adjustment limit of 600 basis points. 
Generally, we originate one-to-four family residential real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 80%, and will, on occasion, originate loans with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 90% with private mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not originate a significant amount of one-to-four family residential real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%. All borrowers are required to obtain an abstract of title and a title opinion. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance.
We do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on one-to-four family residential properties (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer “subprime loans” (loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (traditionally defined as loans having less than full documentation).
Non-Owner Occupied One-to-Four Family Residential Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2018, $3.0 million, or 4.7%, of our total loan portfolio, consisted of non-owner occupied, or “investment,” one-to-four family residential real estate loans, all of which were secured by properties located in our market area. At December 31, 2018, our non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans had an average balance of $35,000. 
We originate fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans secured by non-owner occupied one-to-four family properties. These loans may have a term of up to 25 years. In recent years, in the historically low interest rate environment, nearly all of our non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential loan originations have fixed-rates of interest. We generally lend up to 75% of the property’s appraised value. Appraised values are determined by an outside independent appraiser. In deciding to originate a loan secured by a non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential property, we review the creditworthiness of the borrower, the expected cash flow from the property securing the loan, the cash flow requirements of the borrower and the value of the property securing the loan. We require an abstract of title, a title opinion, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and, if appropriate, flood insurance, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property.
Non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential loans, however, entail greater credit risks compared to the owner occupied one-to-four family residential mortgage loans we originate. The payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property.

Commercial Real Estate Loans.  WCF Financial Bank is expanding its Commercial Real Estate offerings as the Bank has added commercial banking staff to support this expansion into commercial banking. At December 31, 2018, $2.2 million, or 3.4% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial real estate loans, which are generally secured by retail, industrial, service or other commercial properties and loans secured by raw land. At December 31, 2018, our commercial real estate loans had an average balance of $68,000.
Currently, we offer variable rate commercial loans. In the past, we have offered fixed-rate and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans. In recent years, in the historically low interest rate environment, nearly all of our commercial real estate loan originations have had adjustable-rates of interest. These loans generally have terms of up to 20 years. We generally lend up to 75% of the property’s appraised value. Appraised values are determined by an outside independent appraiser. The underwriting of commercial real estate loans includes but is not limited to evaluating the type of property securing the loan, the creditworthiness of the borrower, the expected cash flow from the property securing the loan, the global cash flow of the business, the cash flow requirements of the borrower, the value and condition of the property securing the loan and the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we emphasize the debt service coverage, generally requiring a minimum ratio of 1.20 times computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses we deem appropriate. Commercial real estate loans afford us the opportunity to earn higher yields than those obtainable on one-to-four family residential real estate lending and greater growth potential In addition, adjustable rate terms allow the bank to better manage the overall interest rate risk of the bank. Nevertheless, commercial real estate lending may involve greater risk than one-to-four family residential real estate loans because the loans generally have larger principal balances and repayment of these loans is dependent on the successful operation or management of the commercial property securing the loan. The success of the loan may also be affected by many factors outside the control of the borrower. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than residential properties. Properly managed, this risk is mitigated by the bank with strong underwriting standards. 
Consumer Loans. We offer a variety of consumer loans including new and used automobile loans, home improvement and home equity loans, recreational vehicle loans, and loans secured by certificates of deposits. At December 31, 2018, consumer loans totaled $6.8 million, or 10.6% of our loan portfolio, of which $4.5 million, or 65.8% of total consumer loans, were automobile loans. 
Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. We intend to continue to emphasize and grow our portfolio of consumer loans in the future.
Consumer loans generally have greater risk compared to longer-term loans secured by improved, owner occupied real estate, particularly consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.
We also offer home equity loans secured by a first or second mortgage on residential property. Our home equity loans are made with fixed or adjustable rates, and with combined loan-to-value ratios up to 90% on an owner occupied principal residence or 100% with equity protection program insurance.
Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales and Servicing. Lending activities are conducted by our loan personnel operating at our offices. All loans that we originate are underwritten pursuant to our standard policies and procedures. Our ability to originate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for such loans and competition from other lenders, which is affected by market interest rates as well as anticipated future market interest rates. Our loan origination and sales activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment, which typically results in decreased loan demand. Our loan 
9

originations are generated by our loan personnel, existing customers, referrals from realtors, residential home builders, automobile dealers and walk-in business.
In previous years we have not purchased loans. In December 2017 we purchased $9.8 million in one-to-four family residential loans located in Linn County, Iowa. Pursuant to our acquisition of Independence Bank in January 2014, we acquired $10.5 million in loans, substantially all of which were secured by properties located in Buchanan County, Iowa.
Substantially all of the one-to-four family residential real estate loans that we originate meet the underwriting guidelines established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In recent years, we have sold our conforming, fixed-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans that have terms of greater than 20 years, on a servicing-released basis.

Non-Performing and Problem Assets
Delinquency Procedures. When a borrower fails to make a required monthly loan payment, a late notice is generated, generally on the 15th day after the payment due date, stating the payment and late charges due. A follow-up notice is sent on the 29th day after the payment due date, and again on the 45th day only if the loan is for a personal residence. On a case-by-case basis, we will also include follow-up phone calls. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time future payments are not reasonably assured or the loan is 90 days delinquent, unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Our CEO or Chief Lending Officer determines on a case-by-case basis further actions. If the loan is reinstated, foreclosure proceedings will be discontinued and the borrower will be permitted to continue to make payments. The loan will remain on nonaccrual status until a timely repayment history has been established.
When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed real estate held for sale until it is sold. The real estate is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition less estimated costs to sell which establishes a new cost basis. Any write-down resulting from the acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Estimated fair value is based on a new appraisal or an in-house evaluation which is obtained as soon as practicable. Subsequent decreases in the value of the property are charged to operations. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized as long as the total cost basis of the property does not exceed estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.

Non-Performing Assets. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time future payments are not reasonably assured or the loan is 90 days delinquent, unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid 
11

interest credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans is applied against principal. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. Restructured loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the revised contractual terms for a reasonable period of time (typically six months) and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured.
The following table sets forth information regarding our non-performing assets at the dates indicated. We had no troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) at the dates indicated.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was immaterial, and the amount of interest we recorded on these loans was $0.
At December 31, 2018, nonaccrual loans consisted of 10 one-to-four family residential real estate loans totaling $581,060 and nine consumer loans totaling $63,655.
At December 31, 2018, we had $1.61 million in loans that were not currently classified as nonaccrual, 90 days past due or troubled debt restructurings, but where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with existing loan repayment terms and that could result in disclosure as nonaccrual, 90 days past due or troubled debt restructurings.
Troubled Debt Restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings are defined under ASC 310-40 to include loans for which either a portion of interest or principal has been forgiven, or for loans modified at interest rates or on terms materially less favorable than current market rates. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no loans that were classified as a troubled debt restructuring.

Foreclosed Real Estate Held for Sale. At December 31, 2018, we had $420.6 thousand in foreclosed real estate held for sale.
Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as “substandard”, “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention/watch” by our management.
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required to charge-off the amount of such assets. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional loss allowances.
In connection with the filing of our periodic reports and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the “watch list” initially because of emerging financial weaknesses even though the loan is currently performing as agreed, or because of delinquency status, or if the loan possesses weaknesses although currently performing. Management reviews the status of each loan on our watch list with the Loan Committee and then with the full board of directors at the next regularly scheduled board meeting. If the asset quality of a loan deteriorates, the classification is changed to “special mention/watch,” “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status and classified “substandard.”
Assets that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification, but which possess potential weaknesses that deserve our close attention, are required to be designated as special mention/watch. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.6 million of assets designated as special mention/watch.
We regularly review our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of our review of our assets at December 31, 2018, substandard assets consisted of loans of $644.7 thousand. There were no doubtful or loss assets at December 31, 2018.
As of December 31, 2018, our largest substandard loan classification had a principal balance of $132.0 thousand and was secured by a single family residence. Management believes this loan is adequately collateralized.

Allowance for Loan Losses
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses. Our allowance for loan losses is the amount considered necessary to reflect probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on at least a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.
Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key elements: (1) specific allowances for impaired loans, and (2) a general valuation allowance for non-impaired loans. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio.
This analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment.
Specific Allowances on Impaired Loans. We establish a specific allowance when non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate and commercial loans are determined to be impaired. Loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. Factors in identifying a specific problem loan include: (1) the strength of the customer’s personal or business cash flows; (2) the availability of other sources of repayment; (3) the amount due or past due; (4) the type and value of collateral; (5) the strength of our collateral position; (6) the estimated cost to sell the collateral; and (7) the borrower’s effort to cure the delinquency. In addition, for loans secured by real estate, we consider the extent of any past due and unpaid property taxes applicable to the property serving as collateral for the mortgage.
General Valuation Allowance on Non-impaired Loans. We establish a general allowance for non-impaired loans to recognize the probable losses associated with lending activities. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience with a rolling 12-quarter average, adjusted for qualitative factors that could impact the allowance for loan losses. These qualitative factors may include risk selection and underwriting standards, and other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; level of experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff experience; quality of the loan review system; nature, trends in volume of the portfolio and terms of loans; volume and severity of past due loans; value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans; credit concentrations and levels of such concentrations; external factors (i.e. competition, legal and regulatory) on level of estimated credit losses; and national, regional and local economic trends and conditions. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current real estate environment.
In addition, as an integral part of their examination process, the Iowa Division of Banking and the FDIC with respect to WCF Financial Bank, and the Federal Reserve Board with respect to WCF Bancorp, Inc. will periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations.

The allowance for loan losses decreased $29,000, or 5.4%, to $509,000 at December 31, 2018 from $538,000 at December 31, 2017. However, the allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable increased to 0.79% at December 31, 2018 from 0.78% at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans increased to 78.91% at December 31, 2018 from 65.29% at December 31, 2017. To the best of our knowledge, we have provided for all losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Investment Activities
General. Our investment policy is established by the board of directors. Our investment policy dictates that investment decisions will be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity and pledging requirements, our interest rate risk and our potential long term earnings. The Investment Committee of the board of directors is responsible for overseeing our investment program and evaluating on an ongoing basis our investment policy and objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer has the authority to purchase securities within specific guidelines established by the investment policy. All transactions are reviewed by the board of directors at its regular meetings. U.S. GAAP requires that securities be categorized as “held to maturity,” “trading securities” or “available-for-sale,” based on management’s intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security. U.S. GAAP allows debt securities to be classified as “held to maturity” and reported in financial statements at amortized cost only if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Securities that might be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the security’s prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, or other similar factors cannot be classified as “held to maturity.”
At December 31, 2018, all of our securities were classified as available-for-sale.
Our investment policy does not permit hedging activities, such as futures, options or swap transactions, gains trading or short sales. Additionally, securities deemed unacceptable for our portfolio include any security whose interest rate is tied to a foreign currency exchange rate.
The following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our securities portfolio (excluding Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines and Bankers’ Bank common stock) at the dates indicated. At the dates indicated, all of our investment securities were held as available-for-sale.

Sources of Funds
General. Deposits traditionally have been our primary source of funds for our lending activities and, as applicable, other investments. We also borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines to supplement cash flow needs, and at December 31, 2018 we had $24.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding. The Bank had an additional $13.3 million available for funding at the FHLB on December 31, 2018. We also have an available line of credit in the amount of $2.5 million at Bankers’ Bank, of which there was no amount outstanding at December 31, 2018. Our additional sources of funds are scheduled loan repayments, loan prepayments, retained earnings and the proceeds of loan and securities sales.
Deposits. We accept deposits primarily from individuals who reside in and businesses located in our market area. We rely on our competitive pricing and products, convenient location and quality customer service to attract and retain deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of statement savings accounts, money market accounts, NOW accounts and certificates of deposits.
Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market interest rates, liquidity requirements and our deposit growth goals. We have not relied on brokered deposits and at December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not have any brokered deposits, however it may provide a source of future funding.

Subsidiary Activity
WCF Financial Bank is the only direct subsidiary of WCF Bancorp, Inc. WCF Financial Bank has one subsidiary, WCF Financial Service Corp., an inactive Iowa corporation that previously provided insurance products, but no longer conducts any business.
Supervision and Regulation
General
WCF Financial Bank is an Iowa-chartered bank and as such is examined by the Iowa Division of Banking (the “Iowa Division”) as its primary state regulator and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as its primary federal regulator and the insurer of its deposit accounts. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution 
19

may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund and depositors, and not for the protection of security holders. Under this system of state and federal regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates. The Iowa Division and the FDIC examine WCF Financial Bank and prepare reports for the consideration of the Bank’s Board of Directors on any operating deficiencies. WCF Financial Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a much lesser extent, state law, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of WCF Financial Bank’s loan documents.
Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by the Iowa Division, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on WCF Bancorp, WCF Financial Bank and their operations.
In connection with WCF Financial Bank’s conversion of its charter from a federal savings association to an Iowa bank, WCF Bancorp applied to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) to become a registered bank holding company. Accordingly, WCF Bancorp continues to be required to file certain reports with, is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve. WCF Bancorp is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the federal securities laws.
Certain regulatory requirements that are applicable to WCF Financial Bank and WCF Bancorp are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on WCF Financial Bank and WCF Bancorp and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations.
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The current capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BASEL III”) and certain requirements of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”).
For purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that made such an election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). WCF Bancorp has exercised the opt-out and therefore does not include AOCI in its regulatory capital determinations. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a 
20

risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in starting on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. At December 31, 2018, WCF Financial Bank exceeded the fully phased in regulatory requirement for the capital conservation buffer. 
Legislation enacted in May 2018 requires the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, to establish for qualifying institutions with assets of less than $10 billion a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8% to 10% tangible equity/consolidated assets. Institutions with capital levels meeting or exceeding the specified requirement will be considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including all risk-based requirements. The establishment of the community bank leverage ratio is subject to notice and comment rulemaking by the federal regulators. A proposed rule issued by the federal regulators in December 2018 would specify a 9% community bank leverage ratio minimum for institutions to opt into the alternative framework.
Federal banking agency regulations related to risk-based capital standards for insured institutions ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risk of nontraditional activities, as well as to reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family residential loans. The FDIC, along with the other federal banking agencies, adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank’s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank’s capital adequacy. The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution’s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. 
Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under prompt corrective action regulations, the FDIC is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized member banks. The extent of supervisory action depends upon the degree of the institution’s undercapitalization. For this purpose, an insured institution is placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank’s capital:

• | well-capitalized (at least 5% leverage capital, 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% total risk-based capital and 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);


• | adequately capitalized (at least 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital and 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);


• | undercapitalized (less than 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital or 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);


• | significantly undercapitalized (less than 3% leverage capital, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 6% total risk-based capital or 3% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital); and


• | critically undercapitalized (less than 2% tangible capital).

The previously referenced proposed rulemaking to establish a “community bank leverage ratio” would adjust the referenced categories for qualifying institutions that opt into the alternative framework for regulatory capital requirements.
At December 31, 2018, WCF Financial Bank met the criteria for being considered “well-capitalized.”

Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit system, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The agencies have also established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.
Investment Activities. All state-chartered FDIC-insured banks are generally limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law, subject to certain exceptions. For example, state-chartered banks may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The maximum permissible investment is 100% of Tier 1 Capital, as specified by the FDIC’s regulations, or the maximum amount permitted by Iowa law, whichever is less.
In addition, the FDIC is authorized to permit such a state bank to engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if it meets all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC has adopted procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. In addition, a nonmember bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial subsidiary” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. 
Branching Authority. Iowa banks, such as WCF Financial Bank, have the authority under Iowa law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Iowa, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) without impediments. Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger. 
Dividend Payments. The primary source of funds for the Company is dividends from WCF Financial Bank. Under the Iowa Banking Act, Iowa-chartered banks generally may pay dividends only out of undivided profits. The Iowa Division of Banking may restrict the declaration or payment of a dividend by an Iowa-chartered bank, such as WCF Financial Bank. The payment of dividends by any FDIC-insured institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and an FDIC-insured institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. As described above, WCF Financial Bank exceeded its capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of December 31, 2018. Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, however, the FDIC and the Iowa Division of Banking may prohibit the payment of dividends by WCF Financial Bank if either or both determine such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer. 
Community Reinvestment Act Requirements. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires WCF Financial Bank to have a continuing and affirmative obligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. State and federal regulators regularly assess WCF Financial Bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for additional acquisitions would be affected by the 
22

evaluation of WCF Financial Bank’s effectiveness in meeting its CRA requirements. WCF Financial Bank received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination. 
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. WCF Financial Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Deposit insurance per account owner is $250,000.
The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations, with less risky institutions paying lower rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 2 1/2 to 45 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC’s current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s volume of deposits.
The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The FDIC indicated that the 1.35% ratio was exceeded in November 2018. Insured institutions of less than $10 billion of assets will receive credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to raising the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-range fund ratio of 2%.
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of WCF Financial Bank. Future insurance assessment rates cannot be predicted. 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. 
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.32 basis points of total assets less tangible capital. 
Supervisory Assessments. All Iowa banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the Iowa Division of Banking to fund the operations of that agency. The amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of WCF Financial Bank’s total assets. 
Federal Home Loan Bank System. WCF Financial Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The FHLB System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, WCF Financial Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. As of December 31, 2018, WCF Financial Bank held $1.11 million of capital stock in the FHLB of Des Moines and was in compliance with this requirement.
Other Regulations
WCF Financial Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

• | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;

23


• | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one- to four-family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services;


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;


• | fair lending laws;


• | Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices laws and regulations;


• | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;


• | Truth in Savings Act; and


• | rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.

The operations of WCF Financial Bank are further subject to the:

• | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;


• | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;

The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires financial institutions to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.
Regulation and Supervision of the Company
WCF Bancorp is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, as administered by the Federal Reserve. WCF Bancorp is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve approval would be required for WCF Bancorp to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. In addition to the approval of the Federal Reserve, prior approval may also be necessary from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired before any bank acquisition can be completed. 
24

A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being “well capitalized” and “well managed,” to opt to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. 
A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. 
The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions, including dividends, by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve’s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance that requires consultation with the agency prior to a bank holding company’s payment of dividends of repurchase of stock under certain circumstances. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of WCF Bancorp to pay dividends, repurchase its stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
The status of WCF Bancorp as registered a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. 
Change in Control 
Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as WCF Bancorp unless the Federal Reserve has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s 
25

voting stock constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as is the case with WCF Bancorp, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Federal Securities Laws
WCF Bancorp’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. WCF Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. We have prepared policies, procedures and systems designed to ensure compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations.
Insider Transactions. WCF Financial Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on “covered transactions” between WCF Financial Bank and its “affiliates.” WCF Bancorp is an affiliate of WCF Financial Bank for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments in the stock or other securities of the Company, and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as collateral for loans made by WCF Financial Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.
Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by WCF Financial Bank to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, to principal stockholders of the Company and to “related interests” of such directors, officers and principal stockholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person who is a director or officer of the Company or WCF Financial Bank, or a principal stockholder of the Company, may obtain credit from banks with which WCF Financial Bank maintains a correspondent relationship. 
Transaction Account Reserves. Federal Reserve regulations require FDIC-insured institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). For 2019, the first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempt from reserves and have a 0% reserve requirement; for transaction accounts aggregating between $16.3 million to $124.2 million, the reserve requirement is 3% of those transaction account balances; and for net transaction accounts in excess of $124.2 million, the reserve requirement is 10% of the aggregate amount of total transaction account balances in excess of $124.2 million. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve.
TAXATION
WCF Bancorp, Inc. and WCF Financial Bank are subject to federal and state income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to WCF Bancorp, Inc. or WCF Financial Bank.
WCF Bancorp, Inc. is currently open to audit under statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2018. Neither the federal tax return nor the state tax return has been audited for the last five years.
Federal Taxation
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, WCF Bancorp, Inc. and WCF Financial Bank currently report their income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a tax year ending December 31 for filing their federal income tax returns.
26

Bad Debt Reserves. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), WCF Financial Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at our taxable income. As a result of the 1996 Act, WCF Financial Bank has elected to use the experience method in computing its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal tax return. Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve). At December 31, 2018, WCF Financial Bank had no reserves subject to recapture in excess of its base year reserves.
Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if WCF Financial Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. Federal legislation has eliminated these thrift-related recapture rules. At December 31, 2018, our total federal pre-1988 base year reserve was $2.1 million. However, under current law, pre-1988 base year reserves remain subject to recapture if WCF Financial Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its stock, pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or ceases to maintain a bank charter.
Alternative Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposed an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, which we refer to as “alternative minimum taxable income” in years prior to 2018. The AMT was payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax. Net operating losses previously offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain past AMT payments were used as credits against regular tax liabilities and are refundable in future years. At December 31, 2018, WCF Bancorp, Inc. had $17,000 of AMT credits available to carry forward to future periods.
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A company may carry forward net operating loss carry overs. Under current tax law federal net operating losses arising in years ended after December 31, 2017 do not expire. At December 31, 2018, WCF Bancorp, Inc. had $821,000 in net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes, and $482,000 in net operating loss carry forwards for Iowa income tax purposes which expire from 2036 to 2037.
Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. WCF Bancorp, Inc. may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from WCF Financial Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 65% in the case of dividends received from a corporation in which a corporate recipient owns at least 20% of its stock, and corporations that own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only 50% of dividends received or accrued on their behalf.
State Taxation
WCF Bancorp, Inc. files an Iowa corporation tax return, and the Bank files an Iowa franchise income tax return. The Iowa corporate income tax rate ranges from 6% to 12% depending upon Iowa taxable income. Interest from federal securities is not taxable for purposes of the Iowa corporate income tax.
Iowa imposes a financial institution franchise tax, in lieu of the corporate income tax, on the Iowa franchise taxable income of financial institutions at the rate of 5%. Iowa franchise taxable income is generally similar to federal taxable income except that interest from state and municipal obligations is taxable, and no deduction is allowed for state franchise taxes. Net operating losses may be carried forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.
