We own various unregistered trademarks and service marks, including our corporate logo. Solely for convenience, the trademarks, trade names and service marks in this Annual Report, including those owned by third parties, may be referred to without the ®,TM or SM symbols, but such references should not be construed as any indicator that the owner of such trademarks, trade names and service marks will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, their rights thereto.

We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to extend the lives of cancer patients by pursing an integrated therapeutic (Rx) and companion diagnostic (CDx) strategy. Our therapeutic efforts are focused on developing potential first-in-class or best-in-class molecularly targeted therapies that address the same cancer driver a CELsignia companion diagnostic can identify. CELsignia is uniquely able to analyze live patient tumor cells to identify new groups of cancer patients likely to benefit from targeted therapies. This enables a CELsignia CDx to support advancement of new indications for already approved targeted therapies. We believe this integrated Rx and CDx strategy will maximize the impact our drug development efforts have on the treatment landscape for cancer patients.
 
The first drug candidate we are developing internally is gedatolisib, a potent, well-tolerated, small molecule dual inhibitor, administered intravenously, that selectively targets all class I isoforms of PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In April 2021, we obtained exclusive global development and commercialization rights to gedatolisib under a license agreement with Pfizer, Inc. Our initial clinical development program for gedatolisib will focus on the treatment of patients with hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2-negative, advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Additional clinical development programs are expected to focus on other tumor types that involve a hormonal signaling pathway, such as prostate, endometrial, or ovarian cancer.
 
Supporting the development of a potential first-in-class targeted therapy for breast cancer, like gedatolisib, with our CELsignia platform is a natural extension of our strategy to use our CELsignia CDx to enable new indications for other companies’ targeted therapies. By combining companion diagnostics designed to enable proprietary new drug indications with targeted therapies that treat signaling dysregulation our CDx identifies, we believe we are uniquely positioned to improve the standard-of-care for many early and late-stage breast cancer patients. Our goal is to play a key role in the multiple treatment approaches required to treat breast cancer patients at various stages of their disease.
 
Therapeutic (Rx) Product Development
 
Gedatolisib
 
Gedatolisib is a potent, reversible dual inhibitor that selectively targets PI3K and mTOR. Gedatolisib was originally developed by Wyeth and clinical development was continued by Pfizer after it acquired Wyeth. We exclusively licensed global rights to gedatolisib from Pfizer in April 2021. A Phase 1b trial evaluating patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer was initiated in 2016 and subsequently enrolled 138 patients.
 
On January 13, 2022, gedatolisib was granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer after progression on CDK4/6 therapy. Fast Track designation is granted by the FDA for products that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening disease or conditions and which demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. The designation offers the opportunity for frequent interactions with the FDA to discuss the drug’s development plan and to ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval, as well as eligibility for rolling submission of a New Drug Application.
 
Based on the favorable preliminary results reported to date from the Phase 1b trial, we are preparing to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial (VIKTORIA-1) evaluating gedatolisib and fulvestrant with or without palbociclib in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease progressed on prior treatment with a CDK4/6 therapy and an aromatase inhibitor. We expect to initiate the (VIKTORIA-1) study in the first half of 2022.
 
Background
 
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women, accounting for 30% of all female cancers and 13% of cancer-related deaths in the United States. The National Cancer Institute estimated that approximately 281,000 new cases of breast cancer would be diagnosed in the United States in 2020, and approximately 43,600 breast cancer patients would die of the disease. Approximately 190,000, or 70%, of these new cases are for HR+/HER2- breast cancer.

Four different breast cancer subtypes are currently identified using molecular tests that determine the level of ER and HER2 expression. About 70% of breast cancers are HR+/HER2-, which is indicative of hormone dependency. Despite progress in treatment strategies, metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer (MBC) remains an incurable disease, with a median overall survival (OS) of three years and a five-year survival rate of 29%.
 
Four different classes of targeted therapies are currently used to treat HR+/HER2- tumors: endocrine-based therapies, CDK4/6 inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors. Each of the CDK4/6 inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors are generally used to respond to the related mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy, namely, activation of the CDK4/6, PI3K and mTOR pathways.
 
As specifically relates to gedatolisib, activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway has been implicated in a wide variety of human cancers, involving either activating mutations, or other unknown drivers of pathway amplification. These include cancers of the breast, prostate, endometrial, colon, rectum, and lung, among others.
 
Activities associated with PI3K involve complex essential cell regulatory mechanisms including feedforward and feedback signaling loops. Overactivation of the pathway is frequently present in human malignancies and plays a key role in cancer progression. Four catalytic isoforms of class I PI3K preferentially mediate signal transduction and tumor cell survival based on the type of malignancy and the genetic or epigenetic alterations an individual patient harbors. Due to the multiple subcellular locations, activities, and importance of the different PI3K complexes in regulating many types of cancer cell proliferation, control of PI3K activity is an important target in cancer therapy.
 
mTOR is a critical effector in cell-signaling pathways commonly dysregulated in human cancers. The mTOR signaling pathway integrates both intracellular and extracellular signals and serves as a central regulator of cell metabolism, growth, proliferation, and survival. mTOR is a serine/threonine protein kinase, a downstream effector of PI3K, and regulated by hormones, growth factors, and nutrients, that is contained in two functionally distinct protein assemblies – mTORC1 and mTORC2: In cancer, dysfunctional signaling leads to various constitutive activities of the mTOR complexes, making mTOR a good therapeutic target.
 
In addition, the PI3K/mTOR pathway, like other mitogenic pathways, can also promote the activities of cyclin D and CDK4/6 to drive proliferative cell cycling. The available evidence indicates that resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer is a transient adaptive mechanism, most likely involving the PI3K/mTOR pathway. This data indicates that CDK4/6 signaling is restored in CDK4/6 resistant tumors when PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are applied. Thus, continuing CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment in combination with a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in patients who progressed on their prior CDK4/6 inhibitor, would both blockade the reactivated CDK4/6 pathway and prevent adaptive activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. This suggests the limited efficacy induced by current standard-of-care (SOC) therapies in patients who have progressed on a CDK4/6 therapy reflects the mechanistic inadequacy of relying on partial PI3K/mTOR inhibition (e.g., alpelisib or everolimus) and no CDK4/6 inhibition to address this complex disease mechanism.
 
We believe the complex connection between PI3K/mTOR and CDK4/6 regulated cell cycling can enable gedatolisib to adaptively reactivate CDK4/6 signaling that reportedly occurs in CDK4/6 resistant tumors when the PI3K/mTOR pathway is completely blockaded. By re-activating CDK4/6 signaling, we believe gedatolisib can restore the therapeutic effect of CDK4/6 inhibition when it is combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. The contributory effect of a CDK4/6 inhibitor when combined with gedatolisib would thus largely reflect the interaction between the two therapies that gedatolisib initiates.
 
Evidence of gedatolisib anti-tumor in vivo activity was provided in a study evaluating the combination of gedatolisib and a CDK4/6 inhibitor in cell-line xenograft model where response to endocrine therapy was improved and tumor regressions were induced. In a study evaluating the MCF7 xenograft model (ER+/HER2-/PIK3CA mutant), the combination of gedatolisib with palbociclib and fulvestrant caused 90% tumor regression with no tumor regrowth observed for more than 60 days after the final dose.

Advantages of Gedatolisib over Other PI3K and mTOR Inhibitors
 
The important role the PI3K/mTOR pathway plays in cancer has led to significant investment in the development of many different PI3K and mTOR inhibitors for solid tumors. However, developing efficacious and well-tolerated therapies that target this pathway has been challenging. This reflects the inherent adaptability and complexity of the PI3K pathway, where numerous feedforward and feedback loops, crosstalk with other pathways, and compensatory pathways enable resistance to PI3K inhibition. Another major hurdle for the development of PI3K pathway inhibitors has been the inability to achieve optimal drug-target blockade in tumors while avoiding undue toxicities in patients.
 
We believe there is significant potential for gedatolisib to address previously treated breast cancer tumors and has the potential to be used in other tumor types where the PI3K/mTOR pathway is either: i) driving tumorigenesis directly; ii) cooperating with other dysregulated signaling pathways; or iii) a mechanism of resistance to other drug therapies.
 
As a result, we believe gedatolisib’s unique mechanism of action, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and intravenous formulation offer distinct advantages over currently approved and investigational therapies that target PI3K or mTOR alone or together.
 

● | Overcomes limitations of therapies that only inhibit a single class I PI3K isoform or only one mTOR kinase complex 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Gedatolisib is a pan-class I isoform PI3K inhibitor with low nanomolar potency for the p110α, p110β, p110γ, and p110δ isoforms. Because gedatolisib inhibits all four PI3K isoforms and both mTOR complexes, it prevents the confounding effect of isoform interaction that may occur with isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors and the confounding interaction between PI3K isoforms and mTOR. This compares to therapies that only inhibit a single class I isoforms (e.g., alpelisib, a PI3K-α inhibitor) or only one mTOR kinase complex (e.g., everolimus, an mTORC1 inhibitor), which cross-activate uninhibited sub-units due to numerous feedforward and feedback loops between the PI3K isoforms and mTOR, which in turn induces compensatory resistance that reduces the efficacy of isoform specific PI3K or single mTOR kinase complex inhibitors. 
● | Better tolerated by patients than oral PI3K and mTOR drugs. 
 | Gedatolisib is administered intravenously (IV) on a four-week cycle of three weeks-on, one week-off, in contrast to the orally administered pan-PI3K or dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors that are no longer being clinically developed. Oral pan-PI3K or PI3K/mTOR inhibitors have repeatably been found to induce significant side effects that were not well tolerated by patients. This typically leads to a high proportion of patients requiring dose reductions or treatment discontinuation, despite showing promising efficacy. By contrast, gedatolisib stabilizes at lower concentration levels in plasma compared to orally administered PI3K inhibitors, resulting in less toxicity, while maintaining concentrations sufficient to inhibit PI3K/mTOR signaling. 
 | Isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors administered orally were developed to reduce toxicities in patients. While the range of toxicities associated with isoform-specific inhibitors is narrower than oral pan-PI3K or PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, administering them orally on a continuous basis still leads to challenging toxicities. The experience with an FDA approved oral p110-α specific inhibitor, Piqray, illustrates the challenge. In its Phase 3 pivotal trial Piqray was found to induce a Grade 3 or 4 adverse event (AE) related to hyperglycemia in 39% of patients evaluated. In addition, 26% of patients discontinued alpelisib due to treatment related adverse events. By contrast, in the 103-patient dose expansion portion of the Phase 1b clinical trial with gedatolisib, only 7% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia and less than 10% discontinued treatment.

Clinical Experience with Gedatolisib
 
As of December 31, 2021, 492 patients with solid tumors have received gedatolisib in eight clinical trials sponsored by Pfizer. Of the 492 patients, 129 were treated with gedatolisib as a single agent in three clinical trials. The remaining 363 patients received gedatolisib in combination with other anti-cancer agents in five clinical trials. Additional patients received gedatolisib in combination with other anti-cancer agents in nine investigator sponsored clinical trials.
 
On January 13, 2022, gedatolisib was granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer after progression on CDK4/6 therapy. Fast Track designation is granted by the FDA for products that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening disease or conditions and which demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. The designation offers the opportunity for frequent interactions with the FDA to discuss the drug’s development plan and to ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval, as well as eligibility for rolling submission of a New Drug Application.
 
Gedatolisib’s safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile were determined in a Phase 1 First-in-Human study. The favorability of preliminary results from our most recently completed clinical trial, a Phase 1b study which evaluated 138 patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, led us to focus our initial clinical development program on advanced breast cancer.
 
Phase 1 First-in-Human Study
 
In 2013, Pfizer completed a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation first-in human study of single-agent gedatolisib in patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary objective of Part 1 of the study was to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single-agent gedatolisib administered once weekly as an intravenous (IV) infusion. Seventy-seven patients with advanced solid tumors received doses of gedatolisib and the MTD was determined to be 154 mg IV once weekly (n = 42). Subsequent analysis determined that the recommended Phase 2 dose could be increased to 180 mg IV once weekly.
 
At the MTD, the majority of patients enrolled in the MTD group experienced only grade 1 treatment-related adverse events (AEs). Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were noted in 23.8% of patients, and the most frequently reported included mucosal inflammation and stomatitis (7.1%), increased alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) (7.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (4.8%). Only 2% of patients experienced Grade 3 hyperglycemia. No treatment-related AEs of grade 4 or 5 severity were reported at any dose level.
 
Phase 1b HR+/HER2- MBC Clinical Trial Results (preliminary)
 
In 2016, Pfizer initiated a Phase 1b trial dose-finding trial with an expansion portion for safety and efficacy to evaluate gedatolisib when added to either the standard doses of palbociclib plus letrozole or palbociclib plus fulvestrant in patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. PI3K mutation status was not used as an eligibility criterion. Patient enrollment for the trial is complete.
 
A total of 138 patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer were dosed in the clinical trial. Twelve patients from this study continue to receive study treatment, as of December 31, 2021, ten of whom have received study treatment for more than three years.
 

● | 35 patients were enrolled in two dose escalation arms to evaluate the safety and tolerability and determine the MTD of gedatolisib when used in combination with the standard doses of palbociclib and endocrine therapies. The MTD was determined to be 180 mg administered intravenously once weekly.

● | 103 patients were enrolled in one of four expansion arms (A, B, C, D) to determine if the triplet combination of gedatolisib plus palbociclib and letrozole or gedatolisib plus palbociclib and fulvestrant produced a superior objective response (OR), compared to historical control data of the doublet combination (palbociclib plus endocrine therapy). All patients received gedatolisib in combination with standard doses of palbociclib and endocrine therapy (either letrozole or fulvestrant). In Arms A, B, and C, patients received an intravenous dose of 180 mg of gedatolisib once weekly. In Arm D, patients received an intravenous dose of 180 mg of gedatolisib on a four-week cycle of three weeks-on, one week-off. Objective response was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.0, or RECIST v1.0.

Other Gedatolisib Clinical Trials
 
Phase 2 Pilot Clinical Trial for HER2+/PIK3CA+ Patients
 
The Korean Cancer Study Group sponsored a Phase 2 pilot clinical trial to evaluate gedatolisib combined with a trastuzumab biosimilar (Herzuma®), in patients with HER2+/PIK3CA+ metastatic breast cancers whose disease had progressed after treatment with three or more prior HER2 targeted therapy regimens. The clinical trial commenced in December 2019 and interim efficacy data from the first 16 patients enrolled was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2020. Patients received a trastuzumab biosimilar (8 mg/kg IV for 1st cycle loading dose, and then 6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) plus gedatolisib (180 mg, weekly IV). The primary endpoint was objective response, a reduction of at least 30% in tumor volume by RECIST v1.1.
 
As of a data cutoff date of October 30, 2020, nine of 16 patients achieved a partial response, an ORR of 56%, and four patients had stable disease. Thirteen of 16 patients thus received either a partial response or stable disease, resulting in a clinical benefit rate of 81%. Best responses are shown in the following chart. The dotted lines represent the cutoff for progressive disease (>20% tumor growth) and for partial response (>30% tumor regression).
 
Best Response
 

* Patient whose target lesion decreased by 63% but a new leptomeningeal seeding occurred.
 
The duration of treatment for the 16 patients evaluated is shown in the chart below. As of the October 30, 2020 data cutoff, 16 patients (80%) remained on therapy. Four patients discontinued treatment, one due to disease progression, one due to an adverse event of Grade 1 diarrhea, one participant decision, and one patient being unable to undergo the required MRI imaging due to a titanium rod implant from non-treatment related worsening of scoliosis. At the time of data cut-off, the median time on treatment for these 20 patients was 10.1 cycles (approximately 10 months) and all 10 patients who had achieved an objective response remained on therapy assessment. At the time of the analysis, nine patients had a continuing response. The dashed lines show the response at 3 months and 6 months.

Duration of Treatment
 

Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Patients with Solid Tumors
 
A phase 1 study conducted at the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary activity of gedatolisib combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors previously who were treated with two or more prior chemotherapies. Seventeen patients were enrolled (10 clear cell ovarian, one low-grade serous ovarian, four endometrial, and two lung cancers). The ORR was 65% in all patients (11/17 patients: eight partial responses and three complete responses) and stable disease was 17% (3/17). Among patients with clear cell ovarian cancer, the ORR was 80%, with three patients achieving a complete response.

Planned Gedatolisib Clinical Trials
 
Planned Phase 3 HR+/HER2- MBC Clinical Trial (VIKTORIA-1)
 
We are preparing to initiate VIKTORIA-1, a Phase 3, open-label, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gedatolisib in combination with fulvestrant with or without palbociclib in adults with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer whose disease has progressed after prior CDK4/6 therapy in combination with an aromatase inhibitor. This multi-center, international trial is expected to enroll 651 total subjects at approximately 175 clinical sites across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. We expect to initiate the VIKTORIA-1 clinical trial in the first half of 2022.
 
The clinical trial will enable separate evaluation of subjects according to their PIK3CA status.
 

● | Subjects who meet eligibility criteria and do not have confirmed PI3KCA mutations (WT) will be randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive a regimen of either gedatolisib, palbociclib, and fulvestrant (Arm A), gedatolisib and fulvestrant (Arm B), or fulvestrant (Arm C). Up to 351 subjects who are PIK3CA WT will be enrolled. The three-arm design will also show the contribution of gedatolisib. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Subjects who meet eligibility criteria and have confirmed PI3KCA mutations (MT) will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a regimen of either gedatolisib, palbociclib, and fulvestrant (Arm D) or alpelisib and fulvestrant (Arm E). Up to 300 subjects who are PIK3CA MT will be enrolled. 

 
The clinical trial primary endpoints are progression free survival (PFS), per RECIST 1.1 criteria, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Two primary endpoints will be evaluated in subjects who are PI3KCA WT, and one primary endpoint will be evaluated in subjects who are PI3KCA MT. In subjects who are PI3KCA WT, the PFS of gedatolisib in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant (Arm A) will be compared to fulvestrant monotherapy (Arm C), and the PFS in gedatolisib in combination with fulvestrant (Arm B) will be compared to fulvestrant monotherapy (Arm C). In subjects who are PI3KCA MT, the PFS of gedatolisib in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant (Arm D) will be compared to alpelisib combined with fulvestrant (Arm E).

All subjects will receive treatment according to the assigned study arm until objective progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. Subjects in Arm C will have the option to receive the treatment regimen provided in Arm A or Arm B upon radiographically confirmed disease progression. Subjects will be followed for AEs, safety laboratory testing, tumor assessment by RECIST v1.1, quality of life, and overall survival.
 
Planned Phase 2 Gedatolisib Clinical Trials
 
We expect to use the CELsignia PI3K Activity Test to help support development of gedatolisib for breast cancer indications. Our internal studies demonstrate how measurement of PI3K-involved signaling may provide a sensitive and specific method of identifying patients most likely to benefit from PI3K inhibitors. We believe CELsignia tests uniquely enable us to pursue indications simultaneously for unselected patient populations and CELsignia selected patient sub-groups. This approach can greatly reduce the risk of pursing an indication for a large, but unselected patient population, as we plan to do for the initial gedatolisib indication. By combining the capabilities of CELsignia PI3K Activity Test with a potent pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor like gedatolisib, we believe we are uniquely suited to maximize the probability of obtaining regulatory approval to market gedatolisib.
 
Accordingly, we plan to initiate two Phase 2 clinical trials to evaluate gedatolisib in HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients selected with a CELsignia PI3K Pathway Test. One trial is expected to evaluate gedatolisib in combination with fulvestrant in up to 25 patients with metastatic breast cancer. The second trial is expected to evaluate up to 15 patients with early-stage breast cancer with gedatolisib in combination with palbociclib and letrozole. These clinical trials are expected to be initiated at sites which are already participating in a trial that is screening patients with the CELsignia HER2 Pathway Test. Screened patients who provide a tumor biopsy will receive a CELsignia HER2 and PI3K Test. Patients found to have hyperactive HER2 signaling will be eligible to receive treatment with an anti-HER2 therapy and those with hyperactive PI3K signaling will be eligible to receive gedatolisib in combination with other targeted therapies. Patient enrollment is expected to begin for the two trials in late 2022.
 
Pfizer License Agreement
 
In April 2021, we entered into a license agreement, or the Gedatolisib License Agreement, with Pfizer pursuant to which we acquired exclusive (including as to Pfizer) worldwide sublicensable rights to research, develop and manufacture, and commercialize gedatolisib for the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of all diseases. Pursuant to the Gedatolisib License Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for at least one product in the U.S. and if regulatory approval is obtained, to commercialize such product in the U.S and at least one international major market.
 
We paid Pfizer a $5.0 million upfront fee upon execution of the Gedatolisib License Agreement and issued to Pfizer $5.0 million of our common stock. We are also required to make milestone payments to Pfizer upon achievement of certain development and commercial milestone events, up to an aggregate of $335.0 million. We will pay Pfizer tiered royalties on sales of gedatolisib at percentages ranging from the low to mid-teens, that may be subject to deductions for expiration of valid claims, amounts due under third-party licenses and generic competition. Unless earlier terminated, the Gedatolisib License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of all royalty obligations. The royalty period will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (a) 12 years following the date of First Commercial Sale of such Product in such country, (b) the expiration of all regulatory or data exclusivity in such country for such Product or (c) the date upon which the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or importation of such Product in such country would no longer infringe, but for the license granted herein, a Valid Claim of a Licensed Patent Right. Capitalized terms in this paragraph have the meanings set forth in the Gedatolisib License Agreement.

--


We have the right to terminate the Gedatolisib License Agreement for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice. Pfizer may not terminate the agreement for convenience. Either we or Pfizer may terminate the Gedatolisib License Agreement if the other party is in material breach and such breach is not cured within the specified cure period. In addition, either we or Pfizer may terminate the Gedatolisib License Agreement in the event of specified insolvency events involving the other party.
 
Manufacturing
 
We rely on third parties to manufacture gedatolisib. We expect to enter into agreements with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce drug substance for gedatolisib. We require all of our CMOs to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. We anticipate that these CMOs will have the capacity to support both clinical supply and commercial-scale production, but we do not have any formal agreements at this time to cover commercial production. We may also elect to enter into agreements with other CMOs to manufacture supplies of drug substance and finished drug product.
Sales and Marketing
 
If any of our product candidates are approved, we intend to market and commercialize them in the U.S. and select international markets, either alone or in partnership with others. Cancer patients are managed by oncologists, medical geneticists and neurologists, and therefore we believe can be reached with a targeted sales force.
Competition for Gedatolisib
 
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid evolution of technologies and intense competition. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with approved treatment options, including off-label therapies, and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key considerations that would impact our ability to effectively compete with other therapies include the efficacy, safety, method of administration, cost, level of promotional activity and intellectual property protection of our products. Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products.
 
There are several PI3K and mTOR inhibitors approved by the FDA, including Piqray and Afinitor from Novartis AG, Aliqopa from Bayer Corporation, Copiktra from Verastem, Inc. Zydelig from Gilead Sciences, Inc. and we are aware that other companies are, or may be, developing products for this indication, including AstraZeneca plc, BridgeBio Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Kazia Therapeutics Limited, Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Revolution Medicines Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. There may be additional companies with programs suitable for addressing these patient populations that could be competitive with our efforts but that have not yet disclosed specific clinical development plans. Smaller or early-stage companies, including oncology-focused therapeutics companies, may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, enrolling patients in clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. The availability of reimbursement from government and private payors will also significantly impact the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approvals for our product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to commercialize our product candidates.

CELsignia Development and CDx Programs
 
Overview
 
Our proprietary CELsignia diagnostic platform is the only commercially ready technology we are aware of that uses a patient’s living tumor cells to identify the specific abnormal cellular process driving a patient’s cancer and the targeted therapy that best treats it. This enables us to identify patients whose tumors may respond to a targeted therapy, even though they lack a previously associated molecular mutation. By identifying cancer patients whose tumors lack an associated genetic mutation but have abnormal cellular activity a matching targeted therapeutic is designed to inhibit, we believe our CELsignia CDx can expand the markets for a number of already approved targeted therapies. Our current CDx identifies breast and ovarian cancer patients whose tumors have cancer drivers potentially responsive to treatment with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2), mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET), or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) targeted therapeutics.
 
Our CELsignia platform provides an important advantage over traditional molecular diagnostics. Current molecular diagnostics analyze fragmented cells to obtain a snapshot of the genetic mutations present in a patient’s tumor. Using cell fragments prevents molecular diagnostics from analyzing the dynamic cellular activities, known as cell signaling, that regulate cell proliferation or survival. Cancer can develop when critical cell signaling, regulating physiologic activity such as cell proliferation, becomes abnormal or dysregulated. Since genetic mutations are often only weakly correlated to the dysregulated cell signaling activity driving a patient’s cancer, a molecular diagnostic is prone to providing an incomplete diagnosis. CELsignia tests overcome this limitation by measuring dynamic cell signaling activity in a cancer patient’s living tumor cells. When a CELsignia test detects abnormal signaling activity, a more accurate diagnosis of the patient’s cancer driver is obtained.
 
We are supporting the advancement of new potential indications for four different targeted therapies, controlled by other pharmaceutical companies, that would rely on a CELsignia CDx to select patients. Our first analytically validated and commercially ready test using our CELsignia platform, the CELsignia HER2 Pathway Activity Test for breast cancer, diagnoses two new sub-types of HER2-negative breast cancer that traditional molecular diagnostics cannot detect. Our internal studies show that approximately 15-20% of HER2-negative breast cancer patients have abnormal HER2 signaling activity similar to levels found in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. As a result, these HER2-negative patients have undiagnosed HER2-driven breast cancer and would be likely to respond to the same anti-HER2 targeted therapies only HER2-positive patients receive today. We have four interventional clinical trials underway to evaluate the efficacy of HER2 targeted therapies in breast cancer patients selected with our CELsignia HER2 Pathway Activity Test.
 
Our second CELsignia test for breast cancer evaluates independent c-Met signaling activity and its involvement with HER family signaling in HER2-negative breast cancer tumor cells. Our internal studies show that approximately 20%-25% of HER2-negative breast cancer patients have abnormal c-Met signaling activity that is co-activated with abnormal HER family signaling. These studies suggest that this sub-group of HER2-negative breast cancer patients may best respond to treatment with a combination of HER family and c-Met inhibitors. We have one interventional clinical trial underway to evaluate the efficacy of HER2 and c-Met targeted therapies, in previously treated metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer patients selected with our CELsignia Multi-Pathway Activity Test, or CELsignia MP Test.
 
Our third CELsignia test for breast cancer evaluates PI3K signaling in HER2-negative breast cancer tumor cells. Our internal studies demonstrate how measurement of PI3K-involved signaling may provide a more sensitive and specific method of identifying patients most likely to benefit from PI3K inhibitors than current genetic tests that measure PI3K mutations. We intend to combine these three tests to expand the CELsignia MP Test. With this next generation CELsignia test, we plan to provide an analysis of EGFR/HER1, HER2, HER3, c-MET, and PI3K-node involved signaling activity for each patient tumor specimen received.

In addition, we completed development of our first CELsignia test for ovarian cancer in 2020. This test identifies a new sub-group of ovarian cancer patients with tumors that have abnormal c-Met and HER2 signaling activity. These findings suggest that a significant sub-group of ovarian cancer patients may respond to treatment with a combination of ErbB and c-Met inhibitors. Nearly 14,000 women a year die from ovarian cancer, a disease that has less than a 50% five-year survival rate and a limited range of targeted therapy options. There is thus a significant unmet need for additional therapeutic options for ovarian cancer patients. As a companion diagnostic, our CELsignia test for ovarian cancer will be intended to help pharmaceutical companies obtain new drug indications and expand treatment options for this challenging tumor type.
 
Our overall commercialization strategy is to develop diagnostics that expand the patient population eligible for targeted therapies. In furtherance of this strategy, we have been and will continue to seek collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to field clinical trials to advance the clinical development of their targeted therapies with the eventual goal of obtaining FDA approval of a new drug indication.
 
CELsignia Clinical Trials
 
We are currently collaborating on five Phase II clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of our collaboration partners’ targeted therapies in patients selected with one of our CELsignia tests. The goal of these trials is to support the development of five potential new drug indications to treat patient groups found responsive by our CELsignia test to their approved targeted therapies. These clinical trials include:

● | FACT-1 Clinical Trial to Evaluate Efficacy of Genentech’s HER2 Targeted Therapies. We are collaborating with NSABP Foundation, Inc. (“NSABP”) and Genentech, Inc. (“Genentech”) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Genentech’s drugs, Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Perjeta (pertuzumab), and chemotherapy in breast cancer patients selected with our CELsignia test. Based on NSABP’s updated estimates of patient enrollment rates to reflect the impact of COVID-19, including the recent variants, interim results are expected to be available in the first half of 2023 and final results approximately nine months later. The goal is to demonstrate that patients who have an abnormal HER2 signaling pathway, as identified by our CELsignia test, respond to treatment with a matching targeted therapy.

● | FACT-2 Clinical Trial to Evaluate Efficacy of Puma’s HER2 Targeted Therapy. We are collaborating with Puma Biotechnology, Inc. (“Puma”) and West Cancer Center to conduct a Phase II single-arm interventional trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Puma’s drug, Nerlynx (neratinib), and chemotherapy in breast cancer patients selected with our CELsignia test. Based on West Cancer Center’s updated estimates of patient enrollment rates to reflect the impact of COVID-19, including the recent variants, interim results are expected to be available in the first half of 2023 and final results approximately nine months later. The goal of the trial is to demonstrate that triple-negative breast cancer patients who have a hyperactive HER2 signaling tumor, as identified by the CELsignia test, respond to treatment with Nerlynx, a matching HER2 therapy. 
● | FACT-4 Clinical Trial to Evaluate Efficacy of Puma’s HER2 Targeted Therapy. In December 2020, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital and Puma, a biopharmaceutical company, to conduct a Phase II clinical trial. This open-label Phase II trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Puma’s drug, Nerlynx (neratinib), and Faslodex (fulvestrant), an AstraZeneca drug, in previously treated metastatic EHR-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer patients selected with our CELsignia HER2 Pathway Activity Test. Based on Massachusetts General Hospital’s estimates of patient enrollment rates, we expect to obtain interim results 12-15 months after the protocol is activated and final results 12 to 15 months later. The goal of the trial is to demonstrate that previously treated HR+, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients who have hyperactive HER2 signaling tumors, as identified by the CELsignia test, respond to treatment with Nerlynx in combination with Faslodex, a hormonal therapy that targets the estrogen receptor. 
● | FACT-5 Clinical Trial to Evaluate Efficacy of Puma’s pan-HER Inhibitor and chemotherapy. In October 2021, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with University of Rochester Wilmot Cancer Center and Puma, to conduct a Phase II clinical trial. This open-label Phase II trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Puma’s drug, Nerlynx (neratinib), and the chemotherapy capecitabine, in previously treated metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer patients with brain metastases selected with our CELsignia HER2 Pathway Activity Test. Based on University of Rochester Wilmot Cancer Center estimates of patient enrollment rates, we expect to obtain interim results 12-15 months after the protocol is activated and the final results 12 to 15 months later. We expect enrollment to begin in the second half of 2022. The goal of the trial is to demonstrate that previously treated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases who have hyperactive HER2 signaling tumors, as identified by the CELsignia test, respond to treatment with Nerlynx in combination with capecitabine. 
● | FACT-6 Clinical Trial to Evaluate Efficacy of Novartis’s c-Met Inhibitor and Puma’s pan-HER Inhibitor. In March 2021, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center, Novartis AG, and Puma, to conduct a Phase I/II clinical trial. This open-label Phase I/II trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Novartis’ c-Met inhibitor, Tabrecta (capmatinib), and Puma’s pan-HER inhibitor, Nerlynx (neratinib), in previously treated metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer patients selected with our CELsignia MP Test. Based on MD Anderson’s estimates of patient enrollment rates, we expect to obtain interim results 12-15 months after the protocol is activated and final results 12-15 months later. The goal of the trial is to demonstrate that previously treated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients who have hyperactive HER2 and c-Met signaling tumors, as identified by the CELsignia test, respond to treatment with Tabrecta in combination with Nerlynx.

Companion Diagnostics Industry
 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cancer was the second-leading cause of death in the United States in 2020, responsible for nearly one of every four deaths. There are many types of cancer treatment options, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, stem cell transplant, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapies are drugs or other substances that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecular targets involved in the progression of cancer. Targeted therapies differ from standard chemotherapy drugs in that they are often cytostatic (block tumor cell proliferation) rather than cytotoxic (kill tumor cells). According to the National Cancer Institute, there are currently more than 90 approved targeted oncology therapies, some of which cost more than $100,000 per treatment course.
 
Diagnostic tests to detect single biomarkers are now widely used by pathologists to determine the molecular sub-type of a cancer. When a molecular biomarker test is used to support the choice of therapy to prescribe, it is often referred to as a “companion diagnostic.” Increasing numbers of targeted therapeutics are prescribed based on the results from a companion diagnostic test to detect the presence of a molecular biomarker. Only patients testing positive for the biomarker are eligible to receive the associated therapy.
 
Companion diagnostics are becoming increasingly important to the pharmaceutical industry. The use of companion diagnostics to better match patients to effective treatments positively impacts clinical outcomes and lowers expenditures on drugs that do not benefit patients. Stratifying the eligible patient population to include only likely responders is particularly important when the percentage of likely responders is only a fraction of the total cancer population. In these circumstances, narrowing the eligible patient population is often necessary to meet the clinical endpoint targets required to receive FDA drug approval.
 
CELsignia Testing Opportunities
 
We expect to generate recurring companion diagnostic testing revenues once a CELsignia companion diagnostic-linked drug therapy is approved for patient use. On average, we believe that the lifetime value of providing the companion diagnostic test will significantly exceed the revenue generated from the companion diagnostic development program. We expect to offer each CELsignia test to patients at prices ranging from $4,000–$7,000, depending on the number of pathways evaluated. No tests directly comparable to the CELsignia tests are available today to offer reference points for pricing purposes. Pricing for several proprietary complex genomic tests, however, fall within this range and we believe this provides guidance on the amount insurance companies are willing to pay for highly informative tests that guide patient care.
Our CELsignia Platform
 
We have made significant investments in research and development of our CELsignia platform. To measure dynamic cellular activity, we internally developed two distinct but complementary technologies, which now comprise our CELsignia platform:

● | our proprietary cell microenvironment; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our method to quantify dynamic patient cell signaling dysfunction. 

 
We utilize our CELsignia platform to create CELsignia tests that measure specific signaling pathway activity in various tumor types.
 
Cell microenvironment. Previous research has shown that cancer cells extracted from a patient’s tumor share the molecular features of the primary cancers from which they were derived and could provide an ex vivo (outside the patient) model of a patient’s tumor. The technology around tumor cell extraction from individual patients and culturing techniques, however, has largely remained undeveloped. For instance, we are not aware of any competing diagnostic tests that use live patient tumor cells to measure dynamic cell signaling activity. Studies on the topic have historically highlighted the challenges of deriving a viable patient tumor cell sample from an individual patient tumor specimen.
 
We have developed a cell microenvironment to extract and expand viable tumor cells from fresh human tumor tissue, which meets the three critical clinical parameters a patient-derived tumor cell sample would need to satisfy in order to meet the regulatory and clinical requirements for a diagnostic test measuring signaling activity:
 

● | The patient cell sample tested must reflect the starting tumor’s composition. If samples do not reflect the original tumor’s composition, test results derived from that sample may not be representative of the patient’s tumor. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The sample must be available for testing in less than 21 days. Clinicians generally require test results in cases of complex diseases such as cancer within two to three weeks so they can begin treatment of their patient as soon as the initial symptoms are evaluated or a preliminary diagnosis is made. 


17
--


● | At least 90% of the tumor specimens obtained from a patient must yield testable samples. Clinicians will only order tests that require a patient specimen when they are highly likely to receive a test result. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Dynamic patient cell signaling quantification. The second component of our CELsignia platform involves methods to quantify specific dynamic signal transduction events in patient derived tumor cells. The complexity of signal transduction processes is immense, and the permutations of the pathway variables are practically unquantifiable. Current analytical methods to assess these variables use cell fragments. Point-in-time measurements are limited to assessment of the compositional status (e.g., mutation), concentration level (e.g., protein amount), or activation status (e.g., phosphorylation) of a finite number of signaling pathway components. A key insight underlying our technology was our observation that, no matter how sophisticated or detailed, a point-in-time molecular profile would only provide a snapshot. These methods could not provide a complete, dynamic assessment of the signaling activity driving a patient’s cancer. These point-in-time molecular analyses would, in many cases, only provide a weak correlation to the presence of the signaling pathway dysfunction driving a patient’s cancer. Instead, we concluded that a complete diagnosis of cancer and an assessment of a patient’s response to treating their disease requires measurement of the underlying activity of signaling pathways in live patient tumor cells.
 
To measure live real-time dynamic cell signaling activity, we utilize an impedance biosensor instrument. An impedance biosensor is an analytical platform that converts changes in cellular activity to a measurable electrical signal. When cells are stimulated and change their function, the accompanying changes alter the electrical signal that is measured. The output value is quantified over time and used to determine a Signaling Function Score. To determine the activity of a specific signaling pathway, an activating agent specific to a pathway receptor is used to turn on the pathway and a corresponding inhibitory agent specific to the pathway receptor is used to turn signaling off. When signaling pathways are stimulated in this manner, a change in the electrical signal occurs and Signaling Function Score recorded. By relying on the principle of detecting signaling pathway activity, we believe we can develop tests for a range of disease types and targeted therapies that affect various cellular pathways.
 
CELsignia Multi-Pathway Activity Test
 
Our CELsignia MP Test is a qualitative LDT that measures HER2, c-Met, and PI3K signaling activity in breast and ovarian tumor cells obtained from patients previously diagnosed with cancer to determine whether or not the patients have one of the following cancer sub-types:
 

1. | Abnormal HER2 signaling driven cancer 
---+----------------------------------------------------
2. | Abnormal c-Met and HER2 signaling driven cancer 
3. | Abnormal PI3K-involved signaling driven cancer 

CELsignia’s Commercialization Strategy
 
Our commercial activities will target three complementary groups at various phases of the development of our CELsignia tests.
 

● | Pharmaceutical companies. For each CELsignia test we develop to diagnose a new cancer sub-type, we intend to identify the matching targeted therapies, either currently approved or in the investigational phase, and the manufacturer of those therapies. We intend to initiate discussions and seek to reach development agreements with each of these pharmaceutical companies when we have verified the prevalence of the cancer sub-type and completed successful animal studies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Medical and surgical oncologists. We plan to initially target key opinion leaders (KOLs) in each cancer type once we have completed the analytical validation of a CELsignia test. This will allow us to build awareness and credibility for the CELsignia test as we are generating clinical validation data. When a new drug indication is received that requires use of a CELsignia companion diagnostic to identify eligible patients, we will coordinate the pharmaceutical company’s go-to-market activities with our own. This coordination will allow us to significantly leverage the pharmaceutical company’s sales, marketing, and reimbursement activities, unlike traditional molecular diagnostic companies. 
● | Payors. When a new drug indication is received that requires use of a CELsignia companion diagnostic to identify eligible patients, we expect to coordinate the pharmaceutical company’s reimbursement activities with our own. 

 
Our CELsignia tests are laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, and subject to regulation under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA. We completed the analytical validation of our first CELsignia test and received CLIA certification in 2016. Our current focus is to field clinical trials with leading cancer centers in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate that cancer patients diagnosed with an abnormal signaling pathway by a CELsignia test respond efficaciously to treatment with a matching targeted therapy. Once favorable efficacy data is available, we expect to generate revenues from CELsignia tests performed in conjunction with the clinical trials a pharmaceutical company will field during the registrational phase of our partners’ drug approval process. We also expect that the agreements we enter into with the pharmaceutical companies partnering with us on these registrational trials will include milestone payments at initiation and completion of trials and perhaps at various other negotiated points during the trials. We expect to generate revenue from the sale of CELsignia tests ordered by physicians upon the approval of our pharmaceutical company’s matching drug, as a companion diagnostic. A key requirement for success of these partnerships will be clinical trial results that demonstrate the advantages of using a CELsignia test as a companion diagnostic.

We intend to position our unique and highly differentiated tests as practice changing advancements in patient care. To inform key stakeholders of the value of our solution in order to drive adoption and reimbursement, we expect to employ the following diverse commercialization strategies over time:
 

● | leverage our pharmaceutical partnership and their go-to-market initiatives for the drug with which our companion diagnostic is partnered; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | collaborate with oncology thought leaders, KOLs, and leading institutions on clinical research, publications, and product development; 
● | build an experienced, oncology-focused sales force in the United States and international distribution channels that are supported by dedicated company personnel; 
● | integrate into the everyday practice of clinicians through our medical affairs and client services efforts; 
● | publish important medical and scientific data in peer-reviewed journals and present at major industry conferences, conduct clinical trials; and 
● | work with patient advocacy groups, leading cancer philanthropic organizations, and medical societies to drive awareness of CELsignia tests and the importance of incorporating functional cellular analysis into cancer treatment. 

 
Through these efforts, we will seek to promote our CELsignia test’s unique capabilities throughout the oncology community—from patients, to the physicians treating them, to the third-party payors for these treatments and to biopharmaceutical companies developing new treatments—all with the goal of facilitating better-informed treatment decisions for the greatest number of patients.
 
A CELsignia test would be launched upon the approval of a pharmaceutical company’s matching drug as a companion diagnostic. We would expect physicians, typically a medical or surgical oncologist, to order our tests in conjunction with the roll-out of the pharmaceutical company’s matching drug. The physician will prescribe a CELsignia test and coordinate provision of a patient specimen from a biopsy or surgical procedure. The fresh tissue would then be shipped overnight directly to our laboratory where we would use our proprietary methods to extract diseased cell samples from the patient’s tissue and perform the CELsignia tests ordered. Test results would typically be available in 10 to 14 days after receipt of the patient specimen. For each patient sample analyzed, a Signaling Function Score would be calculated quantitatively and converted into a final qualitative result: abnormal or normal. For patients found to have an abnormal signaling pathway, clinicians would use the results of the CELsignia test as a guide to select a targeted drug that inhibits the abnormal signaling activity identified.
 
Pricing and Reimbursement
 
The principal groups that we expect to pay us in the future for our CELsignia tests include:
 

● | commercial third-party payors; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------
● | government payors, including Medicare and state Medicaid plans; 
● | biopharmaceutical customers; 
● | hospitals, cancer centers, and other institutions; and 
● | patients. 

 
Adequate reimbursement will be an important factor in achieving broad clinical adoption of our CELsignia tests. At the same time, we believe broad clinical adoption will help drive favorable reimbursement decisions. To achieve broad reimbursement coverage with commercial third-party payors and government payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, we plan to demonstrate the economic and clinical value of our CELsignia tests to payors by employing a multi-pronged strategy:
 

● | Set a high bar for analytical validation. We expect to present data on the characterization of new cancer sub-types by CELsignia tests at conferences and will seek to publish the results in peer-reviewed journals. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Meet the evidence standards necessary to be consistent with leading clinical guidelines. We believe inclusion in leading clinical practice guidelines plays a critical role in payers’ coverage decisions. We plan to conduct clinical validation and clinical utility studies that are consistent with the requirements of the widely recognized National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines. 
● | Execute an internal managed care policy and claims adjudication function as part of our core business operations. We plan to make obtaining adequate and widespread reimbursement a critical component of our business operations. We expect to hire a team of in-house claims processing and reimbursement specialists who will work with patients and payors to navigate the claims process and obtain maximum reimbursement. 


19
--


● | Cultivate a network of KOLs. KOLs are able to influence clinical practice by publishing research and determining whether new tests should be integrated into practice guidelines. We expect to collaborate with KOLs early in the development process to ensure our clinical studies are designed and executed in a way that clearly demonstrates the benefits of our tests to physicians and payers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Compile a growing library of peer-reviewed studies that demonstrate the test is effective. We will seek to publish peer-reviewed articles and review papers to help support our efforts to obtain widespread adoption and reimbursement of our CELsignia tests. In each disease area we pursue, we intend to conduct studies in order to develop similar supporting literature. 
● | Reduce expenditures. We intend to build economic models to measure the financial benefits of using our CELsignia test in guiding patient treatment and minimizing the use of drugs that will not likely have a positive impact. We plan to use the data we gather through the use of these models as we meet with commercial third-party payors and government payors. 
● | Exploit efforts by commercial third-party and government payors to contain healthcare costs. A major cost reduction opportunity is to reduce expenditures for drug courses that provide no patient benefit. Our technology will enable physicians to prescribe therapies that have significantly higher response rates than has been the case with targeted therapies to date. Since this will lower the drug cost per responsive patient, we believe widespread use of our CELsignia tests is consistent with payors goals of delivering health care more cost effectively. 



CELsignia’s Competition
 
At present, we are not aware of any other companies that offer diagnostic tests that use a patient’s live tumor cells to identify the signaling pathway driving a patient’s cancer. There are several companies focused on developing genomic or proteomic analyses of a patient’s diseased cells. Initial efforts identified protein targets or genetic mutations, oftentimes referred to as “biomarkers,” that are associated with a disease process to enable development of drugs more closely tailored to specific patient populations.
 
As tools for human genome analysis have become less expensive, a number of companies have also recently launched more complex genomic test panels and gene expression signatures tests. These tests rely on a static measurement of molecular properties and mathematical analysis to identify statistically significant correlations between the selected molecular properties and a clinical condition or outcome of populations of patients with the “same” disease.
 
These genetic tests often have limited predictive success because they only identify some, but not all, of, the molecular and cellular conditions required for a drug therapy to function in a patient. They may identify the presence of the genes associated with a disease, but they cannot determine how the gene products function in the context of a particular individual.
 
Providers of genomic or proteomic tests include diagnostic kit manufacturers, hospitals, and independent laboratories. We do not plan to develop tests where a molecular biomarker can identify drug responsive patients, so our current tests will not compete directly against the tests provided by these other companies.
 
Diagnostics competitors that have molecular method-based tests include, but are not limited to, Foundation Medicine, Caris Life Sciences, NeoGenomics, LabCorp, Quest, Nanostring, Paradigm, Biocept, Exosome Diagnostics, Guardant Health, Roche Diagnostics, Qiagen, Myriad, and Genomic Health.
 
Principal Suppliers for CELsignia
 
We purchase commercially available reagents and instruments from a variety of suppliers. Our principal reagent suppliers include Bio-Techne Corporation, Selleck Chemicals, Sigma-Aldrich, and VWR International. Our principal instrument suppliers include Agilent Technologies, Integra Biosciences, Invitrogen, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. These items are purchased on a purchase order basis pursuant to the applicable supplier’s standard terms and conditions. The items purchased from these suppliers are standard products sold widely to the biotechnology industry. All items purchased are typically available within several days after an order is placed.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We plan to protect our proprietary positions using a variety of methods, which include protecting current U.S. and foreign patents related to proprietary technology, inventions and improvements and prosecuting additional U.S. and foreign patents that we determine are important to the development and implementation of our business. For example, we, our licensors, or our collaborators currently have, or are pursuing, patents covering the composition of matter for our drug product candidates and we plan to generally pursue patent protection covering methods-of-use for one or more clinical programs. We also rely on trade secrets, trademarks, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

Gedatolisib Patents
 
We entered into the Gedatolisib License Agreement with Pfizer in April 2021, pursuant to which we acquired exclusive worldwide rights under Pfizer patents and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize gedatolisib. We have exclusive licenses under the Gedatolisib License Agreement to patent rights in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to gedatolisib. The patent rights in-licensed under the Gedatolisib License Agreement include 11 granted patents in the U.S. and more than 290 patents granted in foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom and Japan. A U.S. patent covering gedatolisib as a composition of matter has a statutory expiration date in December 2029 and a U.S. composition of matter patent that covers the lactic acid form of gedatolisib that is currently in clinical development expires in December 2035, in each case, not including patent term adjustment or any patent term extension, and relevant foreign counterparts.
 
CELsignia Patents
 
With respect to CELsignia, we have three issued U.S. patents, five issued international patents, five pending U.S. patent applications, 23 pending non-U.S. patent applications, and one pending PCT patent application, as well as numerous corresponding non-U.S. patent applications covering our diagnostic approach using cell signaling analysis in living patient cells to guide treatment of patients with targeted therapies. The earliest expiration date of patents is 2033. In addition, we have developed significant proprietary know-how and trade secrets for the various cell sample preparation and cellular analysis methods we have developed.
 
Trade Secrets
 
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and partners. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also generally provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
Government Regulation
 
Approval of Gedatolisib and Other Drug Products in the United States
 
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products, such as gedatolisib. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority and submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
 
Overview of FDA Approval Process
 
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications, or NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug applicable, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.

The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by, or under control of, the trial sponsor, in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an investigational new drug applicable, or IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. 
● | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a larger number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. 

 
A registrational trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the drug. Generally, registrational trials are Phase 3 trials but may be Phase 2 trials if the trial design provides a reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need.
 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a Biologics License Application, or BLA.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time, or the FDA may impose other sanctions on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the requirements of the IRB or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. There are also requirements related to registration and reporting of certain clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently $2,875,842 for Fiscal Year 2021, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program fees for eligible products, which are currently $336,432 for Fiscal Year 2021.

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
U.S. Exclusivity
 
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
 
Patent Term Extension
 
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension for one patent. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between IND and NDA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years from approval.
 
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
 
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment, and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.

23
--


Under the Fast Track program and the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 
In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA provides more extensive development consultation opportunities with FDA senior staff, allows for the rolling review of the drug’s application for approval and indicates that the product could be eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of application submission for drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Approval of Gedatolisib and Other Drug Products in the European Union
 
Overview
 
In the EU, our product candidates also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. Similar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 
The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific trial site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an IMPD, or the Common Technical Document, with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the competent national authority and the Ethics Committee of the Member State where they occurred.

In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 was adopted. Currently, the regulation is anticipated not to come into effect before December 2021. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the EU will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
 
The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 
To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the EU, we may submit Marketing Authorization Applications, or MAA, either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures.
 
Centralized Procedure
 
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that is valid in all EU Member States, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks.
National Authorization Procedures
 
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

● | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 

 
Under the above described procedures, before granting an MAA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 
EU Regulatory Exclusivity
 
In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

Drug Approval-Related Regulations – Rest of the World
 
For other countries outside of the EU and the U.S., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 
Regulations of CELsignia Tests
 
CLIA and CMS for Diagnostic
 
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, regulates all clinical laboratory testing (except research) performed on humans in the United States through CLIA. All clinical laboratories that perform clinical lab services on human specimens for the purpose of providing information on the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease must receive CLIA certification. This covers approximately 175,000 laboratories as of 2017. Laboratories must obtain CLIA certification and demonstrate compliance with CLIA requirements as confirmed by an inspection by CMS. We received our CLIA certification in 2016. We also had our laboratory certified by the College of American Pathologies, or CAP, in 2016, an organization recognized by CMS as a third-party reviewer of clinical laboratories. Several states, including, among others, New York and California, require licensure of out-of-state labs that receive specimens from the state and compliance with the state’s individual laboratory regulations.
 
If our laboratory is out of compliance with CLIA requirements, we may be subject to sanctions such as suspension, limitation or revocation of our CLIA certificate, as well as directed plan of correction, state on-site monitoring, civil money penalties, civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties. We must maintain CLIA compliance and certification to be eligible to bill for services provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. If we were to be found out of compliance with CLIA program requirements and subjected to sanction, our business could be harmed. Failure to comply with state licensure laws, if applicable, could subject us to additional sanctions imposed by state licensing authorities.
 
FDA for Diagnostics
 
FDA approval or clearance is not currently required for CELsignia tests offered as a stand-alone LDT test. If we are partnered with a drug company to launch a CELsignia test as a companion diagnostic for a new drug indication, we would be required to obtain premarket approval, or PMA, in conjunction with the pharmaceutical company seeking a new drug approval for the matching therapy. Historically, the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion with respect to tests performed solely in a central laboratory, like the CELsignia tests or LDTs. The FDA has not required laboratories that furnish only LDTs to comply with the agency’s requirements for medical devices (e.g., establishment registration, device listing, quality systems regulations, premarket clearance or premarket approval, and post-market controls).
 
Although the FDA proposed regulations that would apply to LDTs, the FDA decided that, at present, those regulations are not moving forward towards approval and implementation. In mid-2014, the FDA published a draft Guidance Document describing a proposed approach for a regulatory framework for LDTs that would have resulted in most of the high-value LDT tests marketed today eventually being required to obtain 510(k) clearances or PMAs. If implemented, this regulatory framework would require most hospital clinical labs to abandon a number of tests they perform or to pursue regulatory clearances or approvals to perform them. These proposals met significant resistance from Congress, the hospital industry, and independent clinical laboratories. The FDA indicated in late 2016 that it does not intend to finalize the draft Guidance Document at this time. However, the FDA continues to discuss potential regulatory approaches to LDTs.
 
Pricing and Reimbursement of our Product Candidates
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products we sell or may sell. Sales of any of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, managed care organizations or pharmaceutical companies. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a test sometimes is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that a payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific testing products on an approved list, which might not include all of the tests available for a particular indication.
 
In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the test. Whether or not we conduct such studies, our products may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a test does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 

26

The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of tests and drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of testing products, drug products and medical services and questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available products or treatments, they may not cover our products or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our testing products or drugs that require use of our testing products and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
 
Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular test to currently available tests. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and testing products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for testing products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 
Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and pricing regulation may change at any time.
 
Other Healthcare Laws
 
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, including CMS, the HHS Office of Inspector General and HHS Office for Civil Rights, other divisions of the HHS and the Department of Justice.
 
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our drug and diagnostic products. In the U.S., these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
 
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. On November 20, 2020, the Office of Inspector General, or OIG finalized further modifications to the AKS. Under the final rule, OIG added safe harbor protections under the AKS for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. The final rule (with some exceptions) became effective January 19, 2021. We continue to evaluate what effect, if any, this rule will have on our business.
 
In addition, under a federal law directed at “self-referral,” commonly known as the “Stark Law,” there are prohibitions, with certain exceptions, on referrals for certain designated health services, including laboratory services, that are covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have an investment or ownership interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, an entity performing the tests. The prohibition also extends to payment for any testing referred in violation of the Stark Law. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare or Medicaid programs in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per bill submission, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and possible exclusion from participation in federal governmental payor programs. Bills submitted in violation of the Stark Law may not be paid by Medicare or Medicaid, and any person collecting any amounts with respect to any such prohibited bill is obligated to refund such amounts. Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals.

Furthermore, we could be held liable under the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. This could apply even if we are not submitting claims directly to payors as would be the case with drug products. The government may deem manufacturers of such products to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Several biopharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved (e.g., or off-label), and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, if approved, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under these laws.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year and the reported information is publicly made available on a searchable website.
 
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity, although it is unclear that we would be considered a “business associate” in the normal course of our business. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts. See “European Data Collection” below for a discussion of data privacy and security enactments of the EU.
 
For example, California’s Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, went into effect in January 2020, and the California Attorney General has since promulgated final regulations. The law provides broad rights to California consumers with respect to the collection and use of their personal information and imposes data protection obligations on certain businesses. While the CCPA does not apply to protected health information that is subject to HIPAA or personal information collected, used or disclosed in research, as defined by federal law, the CCPA may still affect our business activities. Moreover, on November 3, 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, under a ballot initiative. The CPRA amends the existing CCPA to include new consumer rights and additional data protection obligations. The new data protection requirements under the CPRA apply to information collected on or after January 1, 2022. With the promulgation of final regulations, the California State Attorney General has commenced enforcement actions against CCPA violators. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of CCPA and the amendments under the CPRA exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. The California law further expands the need for privacy and process enhancements and commitment of resources in support of compliance. Moreover, more than ten states have proposed bills in the last year with provisions similar to the CCPA and CPRA. It is likely that other states will pass laws similar to the CCPA and the CPRA in the near future and a federal data protection law may also be on the horizon.

Similar state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services. Such laws are generally broad and are enforced by various state agencies and private actions. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, and require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or drug pricing.
 
In order to sell products, we must also comply with state laws, including those that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products. These include, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, imprisonment, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
 
European Data Collection
 
The collection and use of personal health data in or arising from the EU are governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive and GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, to the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, including in respect of clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Current and Future Legislation
 
In the U.S. and other jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive.
 
The ACA, for example, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs are calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of covered drugs dispensed to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations and subjected manufacturers to new annual fees for certain branded prescription drugs. As the price of our test may be included in the reimbursement rates for certain drugs, this could significantly impact our pricing. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Trump Administration issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Additionally, Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. In December 2018, the CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of the federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Since then, the ACA risk adjustment program payment parameters have been updated annually. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended. We cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on our business, especially given the new Biden Administration.
 
Additionally, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted:
 

● | The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027, unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, and subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions are suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed legislation, if passed, would extend this suspension until the end of the pandemic.

● | The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 

 
Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which companies set prices for their products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid healthcare costs.
 
Individual states in the U.S. have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Congress and the Biden administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Individual states in the U.S. have also been increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

Other Regulatory Requirements
 
Our operations use small amounts of hazardous materials in research and development and generate regulated medical waste in the normal course of performing our CELsignia tests. This subjects us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.
 
Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
 
Health and Safety
 
To help protect the health and safety of our employees, suppliers and collaborators, we took proactive, aggressive action from the earliest signs of the outbreak. We enacted rigorous safety measures in our laboratory and administrative offices, including implementing social distancing protocols, allowing working from home for those employees that do not need to be physically present in a lab to perform their work, suspending travel, implementing temperature checks at the entrances to our facilities, extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces and providing masks to those employees who must be physically present. We expect to continue with these measures until the COVID-19 pandemic is better contained and we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, suppliers, and collaborators.
Clinical Trials and Collaborations
 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limits on gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns. As we continue to advance our clinical trial collaborations, we are in close contact with our current clinical sponsors, and principal investigators, as well as prospective pharmaceutical company and clinical collaborators, to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our trial enrollment timelines and collaboration discussions. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the focus of healthcare providers and hospitals on fighting the virus, and consistent with the FDA’s updated industry guidance for conducting clinical trials issued on March 18, 2020, we are experiencing delays in the enrollment of patients in our ongoing clinical trials. We now expect interim results from the FACT-1 and FACT-2 trials to be delayed until the first half of 2023 and final results approximately nine months later. As the impact of COVID-19 on our industry becomes clearer, we may need to reassess the timing of our anticipated clinical milestones. Prospective clinical trial collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and sponsors may also be delayed but the impact on the timing of finalizing agreements is not yet known.
Research and Development
 
While our facility currently remains operational, the evolving measures to try to contain the virus have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, as well as those of our vendors and suppliers. Although there is uncertainty related to the anticipated impact of the recent COVID-19 outbreak on our future results, we believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for at least the next twelve months. We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan.
Corporate History
 
We were organized as a Minnesota limited liability company in 2011 and commenced operations in 2012. On September 15, 2017, we converted from a Minnesota limited liability company into a Delaware corporation and changed our name from Celcuity LLC to Celcuity Inc.
Employees and Labor Relations
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 39 full-time employees, most of which were engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are currently represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. During 2021, our voluntary turnover rate was approximately 10%.

CELCUITY INC.
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1. Organization
 
Nature of Business
 
Celcuity Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), is a clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to extend the lives of cancer patients by pursuing an integrated therapeutic and companion diagnostic strategy. The company’s therapeutic efforts are focused on in-licensing and developing molecularly targeted therapies that address the same cancer driver its companion diagnostics can identify. Its CELsignia companion diagnostic platform is uniquely able to analyze live patient tumor cells to identify new groups of cancer patients likely to benefit from already approved targeted therapies. The Company was co-founded in 2012 by Brian F. Sullivan and Dr. Lance G. Laing and is based in Minnesota. The Company has not generated any revenues to date.
Follow-on Offering
 
On July 1, 2021, the Company completed a follow-on offering whereby it sold 2,250,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $25.00 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares in the follow-on offering was approximately $56.3 million before deducting underwriting discounts of approximately $3.4 million and offering expenses of approximately $0.1 million.
 
On February 26, 2021, the Company completed a follow-on offering whereby it sold 1,971,100 shares of common stock (including 257,100 shares of common stock in connection with the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) at a public offering price of $14.00 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares in the follow-on offering, including the sale of shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, was approximately $27.6 million before deducting underwriting discounts of approximately $1.6 million and offering expenses of approximately $0.2 million.
 
2. Basis of Presentation, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future year.
Accounting Estimates
 
Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates and the difference could be significant. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the valuation of stock-based compensation and prepaid or accrued clinical trial costs.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company maintains its accounts at one financial institution. At times throughout the year, the Company’s cash balances may exceed amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had $83,286,381 and $11,378,685, respectively, in money market funds that are considered cash equivalents and not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Property and Equipment
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred; major improvements and betterments are capitalized.
 
Estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows for the major classes of assets:
 Schedule of Estimated Useful Lives of Property and Equipment
 
Asset Description | Estimated Lives 
----------------------------+--------------------
Furniture and Equipment | - 
Leasehold Improvements | -

--


Long-Lived Assets
 
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.
 
Deferred Transaction Costs
 
Deferred transaction costs primarily consist of legal fees and SEC filing fees related to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed on November 17, 2021 and declared effective by the SEC on November 26, 2021. The deferred transaction costs were capitalized as incurred and will be offset against the proceeds from future securities offered by the Company for a period up to three years. The deferred transaction costs will be reviewed periodically to assess the probability that future securities will be offered. In the event that no future offering will occur, any deferred transaction costs will be expensed. Total costs incurred were $22,144 and $0 for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Comprehensive Loss
 
Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. For all periods presented, there was no difference between net loss and comprehensive loss.
Risks and Uncertainties
 
The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the development stage including, but not limited to, dependency on the clinical and commercial success of its initial drug product, gedatolisib, the clinical and commercial success of its diagnostic tests, ability to obtain regulatory approval of its diagnostic tests, the need for substantial additional financing to achieve its goals, uncertainty of broad adoption of its approved products, if any, by physicians and consumers, and significant competition.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The Company’s accounting for fair value measurements of assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring or nonrecurring basis adheres to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

● | Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the Company at the measurement date. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
● | Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date. 

 
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls, is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
 
The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other financial working capital items approximate fair value at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, due to the short maturity nature of these items.
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, as required by the accounting standard for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The effects of any future changes in tax laws or rates have not been considered. The Company regularly reviews deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if the Company does not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.
 
The Company recognizes the impact of an uncertain tax position in its financial statements if, in management’s judgment, the position is more-likely-than-not sustainable upon audit based on the position’s technical merits. This involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary.

--


Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company’s stock-based compensation consists of stock options and restricted stock issued to certain employees and nonemployees of the Company and the Company’s 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company recognizes compensation expense based on an estimated grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing method. If the factors change and different assumptions are used, the Company’s stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for these options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.
 
Research and Development
 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs amounted to $25,758,006 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $7,683,522 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
 
Clinical Trial Costs
 
The Company records prepaid assets or accrued expenses for prepaid or estimated clinical trial costs conducted by third-party service providers, which includes the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials. These costs can be a significant component of the Company’s research and development expenses. The Company accrues for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with service agreements with its third-party service providers. The Company makes significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its prepaid assets or accrued expenses. The Company has not experienced any material differences between accrued costs and actual costs incurred. However, the status and timing of actual services performed, number of patients enrolled, and the rate of patient enrollments may vary from the Company’s estimates, resulting in an adjustment to expense in future periods. Changes in these estimates that result in material changes to the Company’s prepaid assets or accrued expenses could materially affect the Company’s results of operations.
Segment Data
 
The Company manages its operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions.
 
Application of New or Revised Accounting Standards
 
Pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), a company constituting an “emerging growth company” is, among other things, entitled to rely upon certain reduced reporting requirements. The Company is an emerging growth company but has irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. As a result, the Company will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
 
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12 “Income Taxes: Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes” intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside cost basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the standard requires certain changes to be made prospectively, with some changes to be made retrospectively. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2021 and it did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
 
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt -– Debt with Conversion and other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging -– Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (““ASU 2020-06”“), which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2020-06 removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for derivative scope exceptions and also simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The standard is effective for public business entities, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. For all other entities, the standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and adoption must be as of the beginning of the Company’s annual fiscal year. The Company’s early adoption of this accounting standard on April 8, 2021, in conjunction with the closing of a loan agreement, did not have an impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.

3. Liquidity
 
Based on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2021 of $84,286,381, the Company believes that its cash will be sufficient to fund the Company’s current operating plan through at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of this Annual Report.
4. Net Loss Per Common Share
 
Basic and diluted net loss per common share is determined by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period. For all periods presented, the common shares underlying the options and warrants have been excluded from the calculation because their effect would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, the weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted loss per common share are the same.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, potentially dilutive securities excluded from the computations of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding were options to purchase 1,315,321 and 849,949 shares of common stock, respectively, warrants to purchase 377,652 and 353,585 shares of common stock, respectively, and 2,964 and 15,686 shares of restricted common stock, respectively.
 
5. Payroll Tax Receivable
 
The payroll tax receivable was initially recorded in 2019. It is the result of the Company’s utilization of research and development tax credits as authorized by the Path Act. The balance at December 31, 2021 was $298,764 and December 31, 2020 was $190,000.

9. Commitments
 
Operating and Finance Leases
 
The Company leases its corporate space in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In September 2017, the Company entered into a non-cancelable operating lease agreement for building space. The new lease commenced, and the Company moved to the facility in May 2018, in conjunction with the termination of its then existing lease. Rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In July 2020 the Company signed an amendment to extend this lease through April 30, 2022. The lease amendment provides for monthly rent, real estate taxes and operating expenses. As a result of the lease amendment, the Company recorded an incremental $197,211 in the operating right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability. In July 2021, the Company signed the second amendment to extend this lease through April 30, 2023. This amendment provides for monthly rent, real estate taxes and operating expenses. The Company recorded an incremental $193,517 in the operating right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability pertaining to this amendment. The second amendment also includes the option to extend the term for one additional year. The option to extend is at the Company’s discretion and because the Company has not determined if the option to extend will be exercised, the extended lease term is not included in the ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and when it is reasonably certain of exercise, the Company will include the renewal period in its lease term.
 
In May 2018, the Company entered into a non-cancelable finance lease agreement for office equipment with a five-year term. The underlying assets are included in furniture and equipment. The lease contains a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease.
 
When an implicit rate is not provided, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments.

Clinical Research Studies
 
The Company enters into contracts in the normal course of business for clinical trials, preclinical studies, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes. The Company currently has five Phase 2 clinical trial agreements in place to evaluate targeted therapies selected with one of our CELsignia tests. The Company also has a license agreement in place with Pfizer to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize gedatolisib. In conjunction with the license agreement, the Company continued a Phase 1b study – B2151009 related to gedatolisib. These patients subsequently transitioned to an Expanded Access study – CELC-G-001. Timing of milestone payments related to the Phase 2 clinical trials are uncertain and the contracts generally provide for termination following a certain period after notice, therefore the Company believes that non-cancelable obligations under the agreements are not material. Contracts related to the Phase 1b study and the Expanded Access study are generally based on time and material.
10. Stockholders’ Equity
 
On September 15, 2017, in connection with its IPO, Celcuity LLC filed a certificate of conversion, whereby Celcuity LLC effected a corporate conversion from a Minnesota limited liability company to a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Celcuity Inc. Pursuant to the conversion, units of membership interest in the limited liability company were converted into shares of common stock of the corporation at a conversion ratio of 40 units for one share of common stock. The Company had 257,604,208 units issued and outstanding as of September 15, 2017. After giving effect to the corporate conversion, the number of common shares outstanding as of such date was 6,440,139. As a result of the corporate conversion, accumulated deficit was reduced to zero on the date of the corporate conversion, and the corresponding amount was credited to additional paid-in capital. The corporate conversion was approved by members holding a majority of the outstanding units of Celcuity LLC, and in connection with such conversion, the Company filed a certificate of incorporation and adopted bylaws. The Company determined that the corporate conversion is equivalent to a change in the Company’s capital structure.
 
On September 22, 2017, the Company completed its IPO whereby it sold 2,760,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $9.50 per share. The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the IPO were approximately $23.3 million, net of underwriting commissions of approximately $1.8 million and offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, 10,082,050 shares of common stock were outstanding, which included 881,911 shares of common stock issued as a result of the conversion of the Company’s convertible notes. Shares of the Company’s common stock began trading on September 20, 2017 on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CELC”.

On May 11, 2018, the Company filed an amendment to its certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to decrease the number of authorized shares of its common stock and preferred stock. Pursuant to the Company’s amended certificate of incorporation, the Company is authorized to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share and 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share.
 
On June 5, 2020, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with B. Riley FBR, Inc. (the “Agent”). Pursuant to the ATM Agreement, the Company was able to offer and sell from time to time, at its option, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $10,000,000, par value $0.001 per share (the “Placement Shares”), through the Agent.
 
The Placement Shares were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-227466), which was originally filed with the SEC on September 21, 2018 and declared effective by the SEC on October 4, 2018, the base prospectus contained within the Registration Statement, and a prospectus supplement that was filed on June 5, 2020. Sales of the Company’s common stock, if any, under this prospectus supplement were able to be made by any method deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
Pursuant to the ATM Agreement, the company sold 3,082 shares of common stock at an average selling price of $12.64 per share in the year ended December 31, 2021 and 17,725 shares of common stock at an average selling price of $10.31 per share in the year ended December 31, 2020.

On February 26, 2021, the Company completed a follow-on offering whereby it sold 1,971,100 shares of common stock (including 257,100 shares of common stock in connection with the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) at a public offering price of $14.00 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares in the follow-on offering, including the sale of shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, was approximately $27.6 million before deducting underwriting discounts of approximately $1.6 million and offering expenses of approximately $0.2 million.
 
On April 8, 2021, in conjunction with entering into a license agreement with Pfizer to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize gedatolisib, the Company issued to Pfizer $5.0 million of shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to an Equity Grant Agreement. The number of shares issued totaled 349,406 at a price of $14.31.
 
On July 1, 2021, the Company completed a follow-on offering whereby it sold 2,250,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $25.00 per share. The offering generated approximately $56.3 million before deducting underwriting discounts of approximately $3.4 million and offering expenses of approximately $0.1 million.
 
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had 14,918,887 and 10,299,822 shares of common stock outstanding, respectively.
 
Warrants
 
In connection with the 2016 private placement offering of units, the Company issued ten-year warrants to the placement agent of the private placement. The warrants allow the placement agent to purchase up to 55,249 shares of common stock at $7.56 per share. The warrants were immediately exercisable and expire on January 14, 2026 and May 2, 2026. These warrants are equity classified and the $330,607 fair value of the warrants is reflected as additional paid-in capital.
 
In connection with the private placement offering of convertible notes, the Company issued ten-year warrants to the placement agent to purchase 48,615 shares of common stock at a price of $8.42 per share. The warrants were immediately exercisable and expire on April 28, 2027 and May 17, 2027. These warrants are equity classified and the $286,999 fair value of the warrants is reflected as additional paid-in-capital.
 
In addition, the Company granted the purchasers of the convertible notes the right to receive a seven-year warrant to purchase 131,675 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the conversion price of the convertible notes.

The Company’s board administers the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and determines the provisions of incentive awards, including eligible recipients, number of shares subject to an incentive award, exercise price, vesting schedule, duration of an incentive award and other restrictions an incentive award may be subject to. The 2012 Equity Incentive Plan was frozen on September 6, 2017 and any new awards will be issued under the terms of the 2017 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan.
2017 Stock Incentive Plan
 
The 2017 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”) was adopted by the Company’s board on September 6, 2017, became effective following the corporate conversion on September 15, 2017, and was approved by stockholders at the Company’s annual stockholder meeting on May 10, 2018. The 2017 Plan was amended and approved by stockholders at the Company’s annual stockholder meeting on May 14, 2020. The Company initially reserved a maximum of 750,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2017 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance was automatically increased by 102,998 and 102,540 shares on January 1, 2021 and 2020, respectively and will increase automatically on January 1 of each of 2022 through 2027 by the number of shares equal to 1.0% of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Company common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31. However, the Company’s board may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. At the Annual Meeting held on May 12, 2021, the stockholders approved a one-time, 500,000 increase to the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan. The 2017 Plan provides for options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance awards and stock bonuses. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2017 Plan is not less than 100% of the fair market value of one share on the date of grant. The maximum permitted term of options granted under the 2017 Plan is ten years. The 2017 Plan is generally administered by the compensation committee of the Company’s board, which has the authority to interpret the 2017 Plan, grant awards and make all other determinations necessary for the administration of the 2017 Plan.

The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for stock options of $2,488,742 and $1,668,859 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In December 2021, the Company modified the exercise price on 311,000 stock option awards to $13.44, the closing market price on the Nasdaq Capital Market on December 15, 2021. No director or officer awards were modified. The effect on stock-based compensation was $53,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The effect on stock-based compensation over the remaining service period will be approximately $344,000. In May 2020, the Company modified the exercise price on 203,750 stock option awards to $5.10, the closing market price on the Nasdaq Capital Market on May 14, 2020. No director or officer awards were modified. The effect on stock-based compensation was $46,000 and $83,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effect on stock-based compensation over the remaining service period will be approximately $85,000.
 
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used to estimate the fair value of equity-based awards with the following weighted-average assumptions for the years ended December 31:
  Schedule of Fair Value Of Equity-based Awards Assumptions
 
 | 2021 | | | 2020
----------------------------+------+----------------------------------------------------------+---+-----
Risk-free interest rate | | 0.63% - 1.39 | % | | 0.35% - 1.66 | %
Expected volatility | | 76.6% - 76.9 | % | | 73.3% - 77.1 | %
Expected life (years) | | 5.0 to 6.11 | | | 5.5 to 6.1 | 
Expected dividend yield | | 0 | % | | 0 | %

 
The inputs for the Black-Scholes valuation model require management’s significant assumptions. Prior to the Company’s initial public offering, the price per share of common stock was determined by the Company’s board based on recent prices of common stock sold in private offerings. Subsequent to the initial public offering, the price per share of common stock is determined by using the closing market price on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the grant date. The risk-free interest rates are based on the rate for U.S. Treasury securities at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at the grant date. The expected life is based on the simplified method in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 107 and 110. The expected volatility is estimated based on historical volatility information of peer companies that are publicly available in combination with the Company’s calculated volatility since being publicly traded.
 
All assumptions used to calculate the grant date fair value of non-employee options are generally consistent with the assumptions used for options granted to employees. In the event the Company terminates any of its consulting agreements, the unvested options issued in connection with the agreements would also be cancelled.
 
The Company had 2,964 and 15,686 shares of restricted stock outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 15,686 and 0 shares of restricted stock vested during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock of $80,150 and $52,727 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
The total remaining shares available for grant under the Company’s 2017 Plan as of December 31, 2021 was 288,756.
 
Total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options and restricted stock is estimated to be recognized as follows:

2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
 
The Company’s 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) was adopted by the Company’s board on September 6, 2017 and approved by stockholders at the Company’s annual stockholder meeting on May 10, 2018. The Company initially reserved a total of 100,000 shares for issuance under the ESPP. The number of shares reserved for issuance was automatically increased by 51,499 and 51,270 shares on January 1, 2021 and 2020, respectively and will increase automatically on each subsequent January 1 by the number of shares equal to 0.5% of the total outstanding number of shares of Company common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31. However, the Company’s board may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. The total remaining shares available for issuance under the employee stock purchase plan as of December 31, 2021 is 150,223.
 
The ESPP provides participating employees with an opportunity to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP is available to all employees unless they are employed for less than 20 hours per week or own 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of the Company’s common stock. The ESPP is administered using overlapping 24 month offering periods, referred to as an Offering Period. Each Offering Period has four six-month purchase periods. A new Offering Period and purchase period begin every six months on May 1 and November 1 of each year. Participating employees may purchase common stock, on a voluntary after tax-basis, at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on either the offering date or the purchase date, whichever is lower. If the purchase date has a lower price, the employee will automatically be placed in the Offering Period beginning immediately after the purchase date. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP of $41,043 and $42,293 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
The Company recognized total stock-based compensation expense as follows for the years ended December 31:

12. Debt
 
On April 8, 2021, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Innovatus Life Sciences Lending Fund I, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Innovatus”) in its capacity as Collateral Agent and sole Lender. The Lender agreed to loan up to $25 million in three tranches consisting of (i) a $15.0 million non-contingent term A loan that was funded on April 8, 2021, (ii) a $5 million term B loan to be funded upon request of the Company no later than March 31, 2022, and (iii) a $5 million term C loan to be funded upon request of the Company no later than March 31, 2023 (collectively the “Term Loans”). Funding of the term B and C loan is subject to the Company’s ability to achieve certain milestones. The Innovatus Loan Agreement is secured by a lien covering substantially all assets of the Company.
 
The Loan Agreement also contains certain events of default, warranties and covenants of the Company. In connection with each funding of the Term Loans, the Company is required to issue Innovatus a warrant (the“Warrants”) to purchase a number of shares of the Company’s stock equal to 2.5% of the principal amount of the relevant Term Loan funded divided by the exercise price, which will be based on the lower of (i) $14.40 per share or (ii) the volume weighted price per share of the Company’s stock for the five-trading day period ending on the last trading day immediately preceding the funding date of the Term B or Term C Loan, as applicable. The warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and are immediately exercisable through the tenth anniversary of the applicable funding date. In connection with the first tranche of the Term Loans, the Company issued a warrant to Innovatus to purchase 26,042 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $14.40 per share. The Company evaluated the warrant under ASC 470, debt, and recognized an additional debt discount of approximately $0.3 million based on the relative fair value of the base instruments and warrants. The Company calculated the fair value of the warrant using the Black-Scholes model. The Company is also required to maintain a minimum cash balance in agreement with the term loans’ default terms.
 
The Company is entitled to make interest-only payments for thirty-six months, or up to forty-eight months if certain conditions are met. The Term Loans will mature on the fifth anniversary of the initial funding date and will bear interest at a rate equal to sum of (a) the greater of (i) Prime Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement) or (ii) 3.25%, plus (b) 5.70%. The effective interest rate is 11.36%. Additionally, the Company elected to make 2.7% of the interest rate as payable in kind, which shall accrue as principal monthly. The Company is obligated to pay the Lenders (i) a non-refundable facility fee in the amount of 1.00% of each term loan that is funded (the “Facility Fee”), and (ii) a final fee equal to 4.50% of the aggregate amount of the term loans funded (the “Final Fee”). In connection with the funding of the first tranche of the Term Loans, a final fee of approximately $0.7 million was recorded as additional principal and as a debt discount, and a facility fee of approximately $0.1 million was recorded as additional debt discount. The Company has the option to prepay the loan at any time following the first anniversary of the loan closing, with tiered prepayment fees ranging from 0 – 2% based on when the prepayment would occur.

Innovatus also has the right, at its election, after June 1, 2021 and until the third anniversary of the Loan Agreement, to convert up to 20% of the outstanding principal amount of all Terms Loans made under the Loan Agreement into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price per share equal to the volume weighted average closing price of the Company’s stock for the 5-trading day period ending on the last trading day immediately preceding the execution of the Loan Agreement (the “Conversion Right”).
 
In connection with the Loan Agreement and the funding of the first tranche of the Term Loans, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of approximately $0.5 million. The debt issuance costs, and the debt discount are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Term Loans. The carrying value of the debt approximates fair value as of December 31, 2021.
 
Long-term debt consisted of the following at December 31:

13. License Agreement
 
On April 8, 2021 the Company entered into a license agreement with Pfizer to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize gedatolisib, a potent, well-tolerated, reversible dual inhibitor that targets PI3K and mTOR, for the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of all diseases. The Company paid Pfizer $5.0 million in upfront fees and issued to Pfizer $5.0 million of shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to an Equity Grant Agreement. The upfront payment and the issuance of shares were expensed to research & development in full for the three months ending June 30, 2021.
 
The Company is also required to make milestone payments to Pfizer upon achievement of certain development and commercial milestone events, up to an aggregate of $335.0 million. Additionally, the Company will pay Pfizer tiered royalties on sales of gedatolisib at percentages ranging from the low to mid-teens, which may be subject to deductions for expiration of valid claims, amounts due under third-party licenses and generic competition. Unless earlier terminated, the license agreement will expire upon the expiration of all royalty obligations. The royalty period will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (a) 12 years following the date of first commercial sale of such product in such country, (b) the expiration of all regulatory or data exclusivity in such country for such product or (c) the date upon which the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or importation of such product in such country would no longer infringe, but for the license granted in the license agreement, a valid claim of a licensed patent right.
 
The Company has the right to terminate the license agreement for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice. Pfizer may not terminate the agreement for convenience. Either the Company or Pfizer may terminate the license agreement if the other party is in material breach and such breach is not cured within the specified cure period. In addition, either the Company or Pfizer may terminate the license agreement in the event of specified insolvency events involving the other party.

14. Income Taxes
 
Following the conversion of Celcuity LLC to Celcuity Inc. on September 15, 2017, Celcuity Inc. began filing federal and state returns where required. No income tax benefit was recorded for the years 2021 and 2020, due to net losses and recognition of a valuation allowance. The following table presents a reconciliation of the tax expense computed at the statutory federal rate and the Company’s tax expense for the years ending December 31:
  Schedule of Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation

Income tax benefits | $ | - | | | $ | - | 

 
On December 22, 2017 H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. Among the significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Tax Act lowered the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate (“Federal Tax Rate”) from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Act also made changes related to the use and limitation of net operating loss carryforwards generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. For years beginning after December 31, 2017 net operating losses have an indefinite carryforward and the utilization of losses is limited to 80% of taxable income each year.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act lifts certain deduction limitations originally imposed by the Tax Act. Corporate taxpayers may carryback net operating losses originating during 2018 through 2020 for up to five years, which was not previously allowed under the Tax Act. The CARES Act also eliminates the 80% of taxable income limitation allowing corporate entities to fully utilize net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The enactment of the CARES Act did not result in any material impact to the Company’s income tax provision.
 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company’s deferred tax assets relate primarily to its net operating loss carryforwards and other balance sheet basis differences. In accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” the Company recorded a valuation allowance to fully offset the net deferred tax asset, because it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize future benefits associated with these deferred tax assets at December 31, 2021. The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets are as follows:
  Schedule of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
 
 | 2021 | | | 2020 | 
------------------------------------------+------+-------------+---+------+--
Deferred tax assets (liabilities): | | | | | | |

At December 31, 2021, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $16.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for 2017 will begin to expire in the year ending December 31, 2037. The federal net operating loss carryforwards starting in 2018 have no expiration. These deferred tax assets were subject to a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

--


At December 31, 2021, the Company had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards resulting in deferred tax assets of approximately $0.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The federal and state credit carryforwards will begin to expire in the years ending December 31, 2037 and December 31, 2032, respectively. These deferred tax assets were subject to a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
 
Under the provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, certain substantial changes in the Company’s ownership, including a sale of the Company, or significant changes in ownership due to sales of equity, may limit in the future the amount of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income.
 
The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of evaluating whether it is more-likely-than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. For those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, the Company has no significant uncertain tax positions. There are no unrecognized tax benefits included on the balance sheet that would, if recognized, impact the effective tax rate. The Company does not anticipate there will be a significant change in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
 
Prior to the conversion, Celcuity was a limited liability company and therefore was taxed as a partnership for income tax purposes. Accordingly, no benefit for income taxes was recorded prior to the conversion.
 
For years prior to 2017, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state income tax examinations. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of general and administrative expenses.
 
15. Subsequent Event
 
In February of 2022, we entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM with Jefferies LLC, as agent (“Jefferies”), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through Jefferies, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50,000,000. We will pay Jefferies a commission equal to 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of such shares. To date, we have not yet made any sales under this arrangement.
