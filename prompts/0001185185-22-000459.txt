Item 1 Description of Business



Royale Energy, Inc. (“Royale” or the “Company”) is an independent oil and natural gas producer incorporated under the laws of Delaware. Royale’s principal lines of business are the production and sale of oil and natural gas, acquisition of oil and gas lease interests and proved reserves, drilling of both exploratory and development wells, and sales of fractional working interests in wells to be drilled by Royale. Royale was incorporated in Delaware in 2017 and is the successor by merger (as described below) to Royale Energy Funds, Inc., a California corporation formed in 1983. On December 31, 2021, Royale and its consolidated subsidiaries had 11 full time employees.



RMX Joint Venture



On April 4, 2018, RMX Resources, LLC (“RMX”), CIC RMX LP (“CIC”), and Royale Energy Funds, Inc., (“REF”), and Matrix Oil Management Corporation (“Matrix”), entered into a Subscription and Contribution Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) and certain other agreements contemplated therein (the “Transaction”). The Contribution Agreement provided that Royale, REF and Matrix would contribute certain assets to RMX, a newly formed Texas limited liability company. In exchange for its contributed assets, Royale received a 20% equity interest in RMX, an equity performance incentive interest and $20.0 million to satisfy Matrix’s current senior lender, Arena Limited SPV, LLC, in full, and to pay REF, Matrix and Royale’s trade payables and other outstanding obligations. CIC contributed an aggregate of $25.0 million in cash to RMX in exchange for (i) an 80% equity interest in RMX, with preferred distributions until certain thresholds are met, (ii) a warrant (“Warrant”) to acquire up to 4,000,000 shares of Royale’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share and registration rights pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement.
Royale Business



Royale and its subsidiaries own wells, leases, and proved and non-proved reserves of oil and gas located mainly in Mitchell County, Texas and in the Sacramento Basin and San Joaquin Basin in California, as well as in Utah, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Colorado. Royale also owns an overriding royalty interest in a discovery in Alaska. Royale usually sells a portion of the working interest in each well it drills or participates in to third-party participants and retains a portion of the prospect for its own account. Selling part of the working interest to others allows Royale to reduce its drilling risk by owning a diversified inventory of properties with less of its own funds invested in each drilling prospect, than if Royale owned all the working interest and paid all drilling and development costs of each prospect itself. Royale generally sells working interests in its prospects to accredited investors in exempt securities offerings. The prospects are typically bundled into multi-well investments, which permit the third-party investors to diversify their investments by investing in several wells at once instead of investing in single well prospects.



During its fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, Royale continued to explore and develop oil and natural gas properties with concentration in California and Texas. In 2021, Royale drilled and completed two wells, both of which were commercially productive. Royale’s estimated total reserves were approximately 10.8 and 11.9 BCFE (billion cubic feet equivalent) at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. According to the reserve reports furnished by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., Royale’s independent petroleum engineers, the net reserve value of its proved developed and undeveloped reserves was approximately $42.1 million at December 31, 2021, based on the average Henry Hub natural gas price spot price of $3.598 per MCF and for oil volumes, the average West Texas Intermediate price of $66.55 per barrel as applied on a field-by-field basis. Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. supplied reserve value estimates for the Company’s California, Texas, Oklahoma, and Utah properties.

Net reserve value does not represent the fair market value of our reserves on that date, and we cannot be sure what return we will eventually receive on our reserves. Net reserve value of proved developed and undeveloped reserves was calculated by subtracting estimated future development costs, future production costs and other operating expenses from estimated net future cash flows from our developed and undeveloped reserves.



Our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at December 31, 2021, was estimated to be $16,281,919. This figure was calculated by subtracting our estimated future income tax expense from the net reserve value of proved developed and undeveloped reserves, and by further applying a 10% annual discount for estimated timing of cash flows. A detailed calculation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow is contained in Note 19 to our Financial Statements, Supplemental Information about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited) – Changes in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flow from Proved Reserve Quantities.



Royale reported a loss on turnkey drilling in connection with the drilling of wells on a “turnkey contract” basis in the amount of $64,468 for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Royale reported a gain on turnkey drilling in the amount of $1,700,462.



In addition to Royale’s own staff, Royale hires independent contractors to drill, test, complete and equip the wells that it drills. Approximately 98.1% of Royale’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, came from sales of oil and natural gas from production of its wells in the amount of $1,686,424. In 2020, this amount was $1,542,803, which represented 97.2% of Royale’s total revenues for the respective periods presented. See Note 2 to our Financial Statements.



Plan of Business



Royale acquires interests in oil and natural gas reserves and sponsors private joint ventures. Royale believes that its stockholders are better served by diversification of its investments among individual drilling prospects. Through its sale of joint ventures, Royale can acquire interests and develop oil and natural gas properties with greater diversification of risk and still receive an interest in the revenues and reserves produced from these properties. By selling some of its working interest in most projects, Royale decreases the amount of its investment required in the projects and diversifies its oil and gas property holdings, to reduce the risk of concentrating a large amount of its capital in a few projects that may not be successful.



After acquiring the leases or lease participation, Royale drills or participates in the drilling of development and exploratory oil and natural gas wells on its property. Royale pays its proportionate share of the actual cost of drilling, testing, and completing the project to the extent that it retains all or any portion of the working interest.



Royale also may sell fractional working interests in undeveloped wells to finance part of the drilling cost. A drilling contract that calls for a company to drill a well, for a fixed price, to a specified depth or geological formation is called a “turnkey contract.” When Royale sells fractional working interests in undeveloped property to raise capital to drill oil and natural gas wells, generally it agrees to drill these wells on a turnkey contract basis, so that the holders of the fractional interests prepay a fixed amount for the drilling and completion of a specified number of wells. Under a turnkey contract, Royale may record a gain if total funds received to drill a well were more than the actual cost to drill those wells including costs incurred on behalf of the participants and costs incurred for its own account.



Although Royale’s operating agreements do not usually address whether investors have a right to participate in subsequent wells in the same area of interest as a proposed well, it is the Company’s policy to offer to investors in a successful well the right to participate in subsequent wells at the same percentage level as their working interest investment in the prior successful well.



Our policy for turnkey drilling agreements is to recognize a gain on turnkey drilling programs after our obligations have been fulfilled, and a gain is only recorded when funds received from participants are in excess of all costs Royale incurs during the drilling programs (e.g., lease acquisition, exploration and development costs), including costs incurred on behalf of participants and costs incurred for its own account. See Note 1 to our Financial Statements, at page F-10.



Once commenced, drilling is generally completed within 10-30 days. Royale maintains internal records of the expenditure of each investor’s funds for drilling projects.

Royale generally operates the wells it completes. As operator, it receives fees set by industry standards from the owners of fractional interests in the wells and from expense reimbursements. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Royale charged overhead from operation of the wells in the amount of $311,754 for the year, which were an offset to general and administrative expenses. In 2020, the amount was $305,900. At December 31, 2021, Royale operated wells in California and Texas. Royale also has non-operating interests in wells in California, Utah, Texas, Oklahoma and Colorado.



Royale currently sells most of its California natural gas production through Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) pipelines to independent customers on a monthly contract basis, while some gas is delivered through privately owned pipelines to independent customers. Since many users are willing to make such purchase arrangements, the loss of any one customer would not affect our overall sales operations.



All oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets in which production naturally decreases over time as the finite amount of existing reserves are produced and sold. It is Royale’s business as an oil and natural gas exploration and production company to continually search for new development properties. The Company’s success will ultimately depend on its ability to continue locating and developing new oil and natural gas resources. Oil demand is subject to global demand and prices can fluctuate widely. In early 2020, oil prices dropped precipitously, and have since returned to pre-COVID-19 2020 levels. The future market is likely to be subject to continued similar price dynamics. Natural gas demand and the prices paid for gas are seasonal. In recent years, natural gas demand and prices in Northern California have fluctuated unpredictably throughout the year.



Competition, Markets and Regulation



Competition



The exploration and production of oil and natural gas is an intensely competitive industry. The sale of interests in oil and gas projects, like those Royale sells, is also very competitive. Royale encounters competition from other oil and natural gas producers, as well as from other entities that invest in oil and gas for their own account or for others, and many of these companies are substantially larger than Royale.
Markets



Market factors affect the quantities of oil and natural gas production and the price Royale can obtain for the production from its oil and natural gas properties. Such factors include: the extent of domestic production; the level of imports of foreign oil and natural gas; the general level of market demand on a regional, national and worldwide basis; domestic and foreign economic conditions that determine levels of industrial production; political events in foreign oil-producing regions; and variations in governmental regulations including environmental, energy conservation, and tax laws or the imposition of new regulatory requirements upon the oil and natural gas industry.
Regulation



Federal and state laws and regulations affect, to some degree, the production, transportation, and sale of oil and natural gas from Royale’s operations. States in which Royale operates have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of oil and natural gas, including provisions regarding deliverability. These statutes, along with the regulations interpreting the statutes, generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas, and to protect correlative rights to produce oil and natural gas by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or proration unit.



The exploration, development, production and processing of oil and natural gas are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations to protect the environment. Various federal and state agencies are considering, and some have adopted, other laws and regulations regarding environmental controls that could increase the cost of doing business. These laws and regulations may require: the acquisition of permits by operators before drilling commences; the prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness areas or where pollution arises; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling operations, particularly operations in offshore waters or on submerged lands. The cost of oil and natural gas development and production also may increase because of the cost of compliance with such legislation and regulations, together with any penalties resulting from failing to comply with the legislation and regulations. Ultimately, Royale may bear some of these costs.



Presently, Royale does not hold any undeveloped federal acreage on which it had plans to drill, and does not anticipate that compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or its competitive position in the oil and natural gas industry; however, changes in the laws, rules or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, could have a materially adverse effect on Royale’s financial condition or results of operation.
