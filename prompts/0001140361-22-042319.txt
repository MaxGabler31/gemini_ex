 (In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted)
 
General
 
Berry Global Group, Inc. (“Berry,” “we,” or the “Company”) is a leading global supplier of a broad range of innovative rigid, flexible and non-woven products.  We sell our products predominantly into stable, consumer-oriented end markets, such as healthcare, personal care, and food and beverage.  Our customers consist of a diverse mix of leading global, national, mid-sized regional and local specialty businesses. The size and scope of our customer network allows us to introduce new products we develop or acquire to a vast audience that is familiar with our business.  For the fiscal year ended October 1, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”), no single customer represented more than 5% of net sales and our top ten customers represented 15% of net sales.  We believe our manufacturing processes, manufacturing footprint and our ability to leverage our scale to reduce costs, positions us as a low-cost manufacturer relative to our competitors.
 
Additional financial information about our segments is provided in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Marketing, Sales, and Competition

Our scale enables us to dedicate certain sales and marketing efforts to particular products or customers, when applicable, which enables us to develop expertise that we believe is valued by our customers.
 
The major markets in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive.  Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price.  This competition is significant as to both the size and the number of competing firms.  Competitors include but are not limited to Amcor, Silgan, Aptar, Pactiv Evergreen, 3M, and Fitesa.

Raw Materials
 
Our primary raw material is polymer resin.  In addition, we use other materials such as butyl rubber, adhesives, paper and packaging materials, linerboard, rayon, polyester fiber, and foil, in various manufacturing processes.  While temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials have occurred, we have historically been able to manage the supply chain disruption by working closely with our suppliers and customers. Changes in the price of raw materials are generally passed on to customers through contractual price mechanisms over time, during contract renewals and other means.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 
We customarily seek patent and trademark protection for our products and brands while seeking to protect our proprietary know-how.  While important to our business in the aggregate, sales of any one individually patented product is not considered material to any specific segment or the consolidated results.
Environmental and Sustainability
 
 We believe there will always be a leading role for Berry’s product offerings due to our ability to promote customer brands by providing superior clarity, protection, design versatility, consumer safety, convenience, cost efficiency, barrier properties, and environmental performance.  We collaborate with customers, suppliers, and innovators to create industry-leading solutions which offer lighter weight products, enable longer shelf-life, and protect products throughout supply chains.
 
Sustainability is comprehensively embedded across our business, from how we run our manufacturing operations more efficiently to the investments we are making in sustainable packaging.  We believe responsible packaging is the answer to achieving less waste and that responsible packaging requires four things - innovative design, continued development of renewable and advanced raw materials, waste management infrastructure, and consumer participation.  Berry is committed to responsible packaging and has (1) targeted 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable packaging by 2025, (2) significantly increased our use of circular materials by entering into offtake agreements for both mechanically recycled and advanced recycled materials as well as expanded our own recycling operations in North America and Europe in order to meet our targeted 10% recycled  content by 2025, and (3) worked to drive greater recycling rates around the world.  With our global scale, deep industry experience, and strong capabilities, we are uniquely positioned to assist our customer in the design and development of more sustainable packaging.
 
We also work globally on continuous improvement of employee safety, energy usage, water efficiency, waste reduction, recycling and reducing our Green house Gas (GHG) emissions.  Our teams focus on improving the circularity and reducing the carbon footprint of our products.  We anticipate higher demand for products with lower emissions intensity where polymer resin based products are inherently well positioned since they typically have lower GHG emissions per functional unit compared to heavier alternatives such as paper, metal and glass.  Additionally, there is also significant work being done on the use of recycled and bio-based content, which typically has lower associated GHG emissions compared to other virgin materials.


 Human Capital and Employees
 
Overview
 Berry’s mission of ‘Always Advancing to Protect What’s Important’ has never been more critical as we are proud to work alongside our customers to supply products that are essential to everyday life.  We continue to prioritize the health and well-being of the communities we serve as well as our employees and their families, as our global teams remain dedicated to continuingly working with our business partners to ensure critical key supply chains remain uninterrupted and operational.
Health and Safety
 Employee safety is our number one core value.  We believe when it comes to employee safety, our best should always be our standard.   It is through the adherence to our global Environment, Health, and Safety principles we have been able to identify and mitigate operational risks and drive continuous improvement, resulting in an OSHA incident rate below 1.0 which is significantly lower than the industry average.
Talent and Development
 We seek to attract, develop and retain talent throughout the company.  Our succession management strategy focuses on a structured succession framework and multiple years of performance. Our holistic approach to developing key managers and identifying future leaders includes challenging assignments, formal development plans and professional coaching.  Resources to support employee development include operational programs, university partnerships, internal e-learning requirements, tuition reimbursement programs, and apprenticeships.

 Employee Engagement
 We seek to ensure that everyone is motivated to perform every day. To further that objective, our engagement approach focuses on clear communication and recognition. We communicate through regular employee meetings, at both the corporate and operating division levels, with business and market updates and information on production, safety, quality and other operating metrics. We have many recognition-oriented awards throughout our company and conduct company-wide engagement surveys which have generally indicated high levels of engagement and trust in Berry’s leadership.
Inclusion and Diversity
 We strive to build a safe and inclusive culture where employees feel valued and treated with respect.  We believe inclusion helps drive engagement, innovation and organizational growth.  Our focus to date has been on providing training for our global workforce and increasing awareness about the importance of having a culture of inclusion.
Ethics
 Our employees are expected to act with integrity and we maintain a Global Code of Business Ethics which is attested by every Berry employee and provides the Company's framework for ethical business. We provide targeted annual training across the globe to reinforce our commitment to ethics and drive adherence to the laws in each jurisdiction in which we operate.
