Item 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Novavax, Inc., together with our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Novavax AB and Novavax CZ, is a biotechnology company that promotes improved health globally through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative vaccines to prevent serious infectious diseases. Our proprietary recombinant technology platform harnesses the power and speed of genetic engineering to efficiently produce highly immunogenic nanoparticles designed to address urgent global health needs. 
The vaccine candidates in our near-term pipeline, including both our coronavirus vaccine candidate (“NVX-CoV2373”) and our seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine candidate (“NanoFlu”), are genetically engineered, three-dimensional nanostructures of recombinant proteins critical to disease pathogenesis. NVX-CoV2373 has received provisional approval, conditional marketing authorization (“CMA”) and emergency use authorization (“EUA”) from multiple regulatory authorities globally. In January 2022, we also submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for EUA of NVX-CoV2373. We also advanced our NanoFlu Program vaccine program through a Phase 3 clinical trial, which demonstrated positive top-line results and achieved statistical significance in key secondary endpoints. Additionally, we are exploring a number of combination vaccine candidates including a COVID-Influenza combination vaccine currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. We believe that our protein-subunit-based candidates elicit differentiated immune responses that may be more efficacious than naturally occurring immunity or other vaccine approaches. These vaccine candidates incorporate our proprietary saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate higher levels of neutralizing antibodies.
We were incorporated in 1987 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 21 Firstfield Road, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20878, and our telephone number is (240) 268-2000. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “NVAX.”
NVX-CoV2373 Regulatory and Licensure
We have made substantial progress in advancing NVX-CoV2373 toward regulatory approvals. We have received several authorizations, which collectively have the potential to reach over six billion individuals, and we have completed additional regulatory submissions in other major markets. We are in active discussions with regulatory authorities and remain focused on seeking additional authorizations for NVX-CoV2373. We continue to work closely with governments, regulatory authorities, and non-governmental organizations in our commitment to facilitating equitable global access to our COVID-19 vaccine. 
For the territories in which our vaccine has gained authorization, NVX-CoV2373 is marketed under the brand name of Covovax™ (manufacturing and commercialization by the Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. (“SIIPL”)) or as Nuvaxovid™ COVID-19 Vaccine (SARS-CoV-2 rS [Recombinant, adjuvanted]).

Technology Overview
Recombinant Nanoparticle Vaccine Technology
Our recombinant nanoparticle vaccines combine the power and speed of genetic engineering to efficiently produce a new class of highly immunogenic vaccines that target a variety of viral pathogens.
Once a pathogenic threat has been identified, the genetic sequence encoding the antigen is selected for subsequent use in developing the vaccine construct. The genetic sequence may be optimized to enhance protein stability or confer resistance to degradation. This genetic construct is inserted into the baculovirus Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9/BV) insect cell-expression system, which enables efficient, large-scale expression of the optimized protein. The Sf9/BV system produces proteins that are properly folded and modified – which can be critical for functional, protective immunity – as the vaccine antigen. Protein antigens are purified and organized around a polysorbate-based nanoparticle core, in a configuration that resembles their native presentation. This presentation results in a highly immunogenic nanoparticle that is ready to be formulated with Matrix-M™ adjuvant. We believe our vaccine technology is well-suited for the development of additional vaccine candidates targeting a broad scope of respiratory and other emerging infectious diseases.
Matrix-M™ Adjuvant
Our proprietary Matrix-M™ adjuvant has been a key differentiator within our platform. This adjuvant has demonstrated potent and well-tolerated efficacy by stimulating the entry of antigen presenting cells (“APCs”) into the injection site and enhancing antigen presentation in local lymph nodes, which in turn activates APC cells, T-cells, and B-cell populations, thereby boosting immune response. Matrix-M™ adjuvant has been shown to produce a long-lasting memory response, through the production of plasma cells, memory B-cells, high affinity antibodies, and CD4+ T-cells. This potent mechanism of action enables a lower dose of antigen required to achieve the desired immune response and we believe thereby contributes to increased vaccine supply and manufacturing capacity. These immune-boosting and dose-sparing capabilities contribute to the adjuvant’s highly unique profile. 
We continue to evaluate commercial opportunities for the use of our Matrix-M™ adjuvant alongside vaccine antigens produced by other manufacturers. Matrix-M™ is being evaluated in combination with several partner-led malaria vaccine candidates, including in a Phase 3 trial for R21, a malaria vaccine candidate created by the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford. The University of Oxford has partnered with SIIPL for commercial development of R21 and has granted SIIPL a license for R21. We expect to manufacture and supply the Matrix-M™ adjuvant component of R21 to SIIPL, which represents a significant commercial opportunity for our adjuvant, pending possible licensure. We have commercial rights to sell and distribute the SIIPL-manufactured R21 in certain countries, primarily in the travelers’ and military vaccine markets.
We are also supplying Matrix-M™ adjuvant for two Phase 1 clinical trials led by National Institutes of Health teams, focused on Epstein-Barr virus and Malaria transmission blocking.
Pipeline Overview
Our development pipeline encompasses vaccine candidates spanning multiple therapeutic areas, with our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, as the leading product candidate, which has received provisional registration, CMA, or EUA in a number of jurisdictions. We have also submitted a request to the FDA for EUA of NVX-CoV2373. Beyond COVID-19, our pipeline includes programs for seasonal influenza, a combination vaccine consisting of NanoFlu and NVX-CoV2373, RSV, and Matrix-MTM adjuvant collaborations for the treatment of malaria. We advanced NVX-CoV2373 through two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that demonstrated high efficacy against both the original COVID-19 strain and commonly circulating COVID-19 variants of concern (“VoC”), while maintaining a favorable safety profile. We also advanced our NanoFlu Program through a Phase 3 clinical trial, which demonstrated positive top-line results and achieved statistical significance in key secondary endpoints. We initiated a trial of a combination vaccine consisting of our NanoFlu Program and NVX-CoV2373 and remain interested in further development of our RSV Program for respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate (“RSV F Vaccine”). Ongoing Phase 3 trials are being conducted for R21, a malaria candidate, by our partners, Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, which is formulated with our Matrix-M™ adjuvant.
We remain focused on bringing our NVX-CoV2373 vaccine candidate to market following global regulatory authorizations. Through ongoing booster studies in our clinical trials, as well as the development of COVID-19 variant strain vaccine candidates, we continue to collect data to characterize and improve vaccine performance. We expect to leverage these clinical insights to advance the use and additional regulatory approvals of our COVID-19 vaccine for both primary 
vaccination around the globe, to use within a booster setting, and for the pediatric population amidst the ongoing and evolving COVID-19 pandemic.
Although NVX-CoV2373 and our NanoFlu Program are our near-term priorities, we remain optimistic that the additional programs in our pipeline, including our RSV Program, and our partner-led malaria candidate, present strong opportunities for future development.
Coronavirus
NVX-CoV2373 Clinical Development
NVX-CoV2373 has progressed through multiple clinical trials, including two Phase 3 trials, one Phase 2b trial, and one Phase 1/2 trial. We have completed crossover arms in our Phase 3 UK, Phase 2b South Africa, PREVENT-19 Phase 3 U.S. and Mexico, and PREVENT-19 pediatric expansion trials. Through our clinical development program to date, we have established a dose of 5 micrograms of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix-M™ adjuvant for late-stage development. We have collected data that indicates a reassuring safety profile and statistically significant levels of efficacy for NVX-CoV2373 against the original COVID-19 strain and commonly circulating VOC. 
A summary and status of our clinical development of NVX-CoV2373 by trial is as follows:
PREVENT-19 Phase 3 U.S. and Mexico
PREVENT-19 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373 in 29,960 participants aged 18 years or older across 119 sites in the U.S. and Mexico. Enrollment for PREVENT-19 emphasized recruiting high-risk groups most impacted by COVID-19.
In December 2021, the full results from the PREVENT-19 Phase 3 trial in the U.S. and Mexico were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The analysis, previously announced in June 2021, was conducted on events accrued prior to participants receiving crossover vaccine. NVX-CoV2373 achieved 100% protection against moderate and severe disease, 92.6% efficacy against any VOC and variants of interest (“VOI”), and the primary endpoint of 90.4% efficacy against COVID-19 of any severity during the time period evaluated, despite the majority (79%) of the sequenced cases of illness being attributed to VOC and VOI. PREVENT-19 was conducted with support and funding from OWS.
In November 2021, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) provided guidance stating that our PREVENT-19 participants from sites outside the U.S., as well as previously stated guidance stating participants from within the U.S., are considered fully vaccinated. In January 2022, we also submitted a request to the FDA for EUA of NVX-CoV2373.
PREVENT-19 Pediatric Expansion
In February 2022, we announced positive results from our Phase 3 PREVENT-19 pediatric expansion in adolescents aged 12 to 17, for which we completed enrollment in June 2021. The study results achieved their primary effectiveness endpoint and demonstrated 80% efficacy overall, with 82% clinical efficacy against the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, as the trial was conducted when the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant was the predominant circulating strain in the U.S. Immune responses were two-to-three-fold higher in adolescents than in adults against all variants studied. NVX-CoV2373 was well-tolerated with no safety signals identified. 
The study enrolled 2,247 adolescents across 73 sites in the U.S. to evaluate safety, effectiveness (immunogenicity), and efficacy, with an emphasis on ensuring well-balanced racial and ethnic representation among participants. Participants randomly received either the vaccine candidate or placebo in two doses, administered 21 days apart. Two-thirds of participants received intramuscular injections of the vaccine and one-third received placebo. Participants are being monitored for safety for up to two years following the final administered dose. 
We expect to submit our regulatory filing to global regulatory authorities during the first quarter of 2022. The subsequent pediatric clinical development plan has been agreed to by the FDA, the MHRA, and EMA and we expect to initiate additional studies globally evaluating younger age groups during the second quarter of 2022.
In December 2021, we announced initial data evaluating the immune response of NVX-CoV2373 against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant strain from our ongoing PREVENT-19 pediatric expansion. Data from this study showed immune responses in adolescents were 2- to 4-fold higher than adults against broad array of variants of interest and variants of concern.
Phase 3 UK
In February 2022, we announced extended analysis from our pivotal Phase 3 UK trial showing that a high level of efficacy for NVX-CoV2373 was maintained over a 6-month period of surveillance. The analysis showed vaccine efficacy of 82.5% in protection against all COVID-19 infection, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, as measured by PCR+ or anti-N seroconversion. NVX-CoV2373 showed a reassuring safety profile during over the 6-month period, with adverse events that were balanced between vaccine and placebo groups. Additionally, the trial demonstrated continued protection with an overall vaccine efficacy of 82.7% and vaccine efficacy against severe disease was 100% during the 6-month efficacy collection window, in line with the initial analysis.
This data builds upon the final analysis of our Phase 3 UK trial was published in The New England Journal of Medicine in June 2021. The publication of the final analysis highlights the robust safety and efficacy data for NVX-CoV2373. The final analysis confirmed 89.7% overall efficacy, with over 60% of the cases caused by the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant strain. The analysis also confirmed 96.4% efficacy against non-Alpha (non-B.1.1.7) variant strains present at the time of the study, which represents strains most similar to the original COVID-19 virus. The trial was a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 15,203 adults aged 18 to 84. The trial was conducted in partnership with the UK government Vaccines Taskforce (“VTF”) and led by researchers at St George’s, University of London, and St George’s Hospital, London.
In June 2021, the National Health Service (“NHS”), UK government VTF, and National Institute for Health Research determined participants in our Phase 3 UK trial may be considered fully vaccinated under the standard NHS program.
Phase 3 UK Influenza Co-Administration Sub-Study
In November 2021, positive results from our Phase 3 UK influenza co-administration sub-study, the first co-administration study of a SARS-CoV2 vaccine candidate and an approved influenza vaccine were published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. In the sub-study, with initial data announced in June 2021, 431 participants from our Phase 3 UK trial received an approved seasonal influenza vaccine (Seqirus, adjuvanted, trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine or a cell-based quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine). Approximately half of the participants in the study were co-vaccinated with NVX-CoV2373, while the remainder received placebo. Results demonstrated a robust immune response and a favorable safety and reactogenicity profile. Immunogenicity of the influenza vaccine was preserved with concomitant administration, while a modest decrease in the immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373 was found. There was an adequate number of participants aged 18 to 64 years to confirm an efficacy trend of 87.5% against COVID-19. The co-administration sub-study represents the first study of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate and an approved influenza vaccine, and was led by researchers at St George’s, University of London and St George’s Hospital, London.
Phase 2b South Africa
In May 2021, results from the initial primary analysis of our Phase 2b South Africa trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The publication of the initial primary analysis, which was previously announced in January 2021, highlights NVX-CoV2373’s cross-protection against the Beta (B.1.351) variant strain prevalent in South Africa during the study.
The Phase 2b South Africa trial was a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 4,404 participants. Half of the trial participants received two intramuscular injections of NVX-CoV2373, administered 21 days apart, while the other half of the trial participants received placebo.
In the complete analysis announced in March 2021, NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated 55.4% efficacy for the prevention of mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease in the 95% of the trial population that was HIV-negative. Overall efficacy, including both HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants, was 48.6% predominantly against the Beta (B.1.351) variant strain, with the complete analysis showing that NVX-CoV2373 achieved its primary efficacy endpoint in the overall trial population. During the efficacy analysis, the Beta (B.1.351) variant strain circulating in South Africa accounted for approximately 93% of sequenced cases in our Phase 2b trial. There were no cases of severe disease in the NVX-CoV2373 group, and all hospitalization and death occurred in the placebo group. This trial also showed that the vaccine is well-tolerated, with low levels of serious adverse events, or SAEs, through day 35, balanced between vaccine and placebo groups. CEPI funded the manufacturing of doses of NVX-CoV2373 for this Phase 2b clinical trial, which was also supported in part by a $15.0 million grant from BMGF.
NVX-CoV2373 Clinical Development Conducted by Partners
Phase 2/3 India
SIIPL has expanded their Phase 2/3 clinical trial of NVX-CoV2373 in India to include a pediatric cohort. In the pediatric cohort, SIIPL has initiated recruitment of participants aged 2-17 years, with the intention of completing enrollment of 920 total participants. Previously, in April 2021, SIIPL completed enrollment of approximately 1,600 participants aged 18 years and older in their initial cohort. This study, which was initiated in March 2021, will evaluate the safety and immune response of NVX-CoV2373.
Phase 1/2 Japan
In March 2021, Takeda completed enrollment of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of NVX-CoV2373 in Japan. This placebo-controlled trial will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of NVX-CoV2373 in 200 participants aged 20 years and older. The interim clinical study report has been completed with the safety and immunogenicity data needed to support the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency application. Participants are currently in their twelve-month safety follow-up.
Variant Strain (Monovalent and/or Bivalent) Vaccine Development
Our nanoparticle vaccine technology is purpose-built to rapidly address evolving infectious disease threats. As variants of COVID-19 emerge, we proactively evaluate NVX-CoV2373’s ability to protect against variant strains and evaluate the potential need for variant-specific vaccine constructs.
COVID-19 Omicron (B.1.1.529) Variant Strain Vaccine 
In December 2021, we began development of an Omicron-specific vaccine construct of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (rS) antigen, currently in use in NVX-CoV2373, and initiated GMP manufacturing. We expect delivery towards the end of the first quarter of 2022. 
NVX-CoV2373 Booster Studies
PREVENT-19 Booster Study
In December 2021, we initiated PREVENT-19 Phase 3 trial booster study for NVX-CoV2373. The study will evaluate the safety the safety and efficacy of a heterologous or homologous third dose of NVX-CoV2373. All the PREVENT-19 trial participants are eligible to receive a third booster dose. The booster dose is identical to the active vaccine previously administered to the participants in a two-dose regimen (5 micrograms of recombinant Spike protein plus 50 micrograms of Matrix-M™ adjuvant) and may be administered at least six months after receipt of active vaccine. The primary endpoint is the first occurrence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed mild, moderate or severe COVID-19 with onset at least seven days after the third (booster) vaccine dose. Two additional groups will be evaluated in this portion of the trial. Trial participants who initially received placebo and subsequently received a different COVID-19 vaccine are also eligible for a booster dose of NVX-CoV2373. Participants who were unblinded after initially receiving active vaccine and did not subsequently receive another vaccine will also be eligible to be boosted with NVX-CoV2373.
Phase 2 U.S. and Australia Booster Study - Including Omicron (B.1.1.529) Variant Results 
In December 2021, we announced initial data evaluating the immune response of NVX-CoV2373 against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant strain as well as additional data from our ongoing Phase 2 booster study. These results demonstrated broad cross-reactivity against the Omicron variant and other circulating variants for primary 2-dose regimen, with enhanced responses following a third dose at six months. The third dose produced increased immune responses to the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant strain comparable to or exceeding levels associated with protection in Phase 3 clinical trials, with a 9.3-fold IgG rise and a 19.9-fold increase in hACE2 inhibition increase after booster dose. Data from this study are available ahead of publication via the preprint server for biology on medRxiv.
In September 2021, we initiated a twelve-month booster dose for select participants in the Phase 2 portion of our U.S. and Australia Phase 1/2 trial. Select participants received a fourth 5 microgram dose at twelve months to examine the immune responses produced by our vaccine candidate.
In August 2021, we announced data from our six-month booster study in the Phase 2 portion of our U.S. and Australia Phase 1/2 trial, which we initiated in March 2021. Select participants in the 5 microgram dose cohort received a third 5 microgram dose (booster dose) at six months to examine the immune responses of our vaccine candidate. Analysis of sera from primary vaccination series notably showed cross-reactive, functional antibodies to Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variant spike proteins, all of which increased 6- to 10-fold with the booster dose.
NVX-CoV2373: Partner-Led Vaccine Mix and Match Clinical Study
Mix-and-Match COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Trial ("Cov-Boost") – Led by University Hospital Southampton NHS
In December 2021, the UK government VTF announced top-line data from the heterologous boosting, Phase 2 Cov-Boost study published in The Lancet from the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. NVX-CoV2373 was one of seven COVID-19 vaccines studied for the potential to provide a booster dose from a different manufacturer for individuals who previously received two doses of an authorized vaccine. The results demonstrated that administration of NVX-CoV2373 among other studied COVID-19 vaccines, resulted in substantial increases in functional antibody titers when given as a third dose in two heterologous vaccination regiments. This study reinforces our confidence in the potential for NVX-CoV2373 to serve as a well-tolerated third dose to boost immune levels and provide broad protection against disease without a burdensome side effect profile.

The trial, which was initiated in June 2021, completed enrollment in July of 2,886 participants aged 30 years and older. NVX-CoV2373 is one of seven COVID-19 vaccines evaluating the potential for providing a booster dose from different manufacturers to individuals who have previously received two doses of an authorized vaccine. The trial assesses the safety and immune response against COVID-19 provided by the various vaccine schedules. The trial is led by the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust and other UK National Institute for Health Research sites. Cov-Boost is receiving support from the UK government VTF and Department of Health and Social Care.
COVID-19 Vaccine Funding
We have secured critical funding to support the development of NVX-CoV2373. Through the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, funding for NVX-CoV2373 encompasses over $2 billion from sources including CEPI, DoD, and OWS.
In April 2021, our Base Agreement and a Project Agreement (together, as amended and supplemented, the “OWS Agreement”) entered into with Advanced Technology International, Inc., the Consortium Management Firm acting on behalf of the Medical CBRN Defense Consortium in connection with OWS, was amended to fully fund the agreement up to $1.75 billion to support certain activities related to the development of NVX-CoV2373. This includes the manufacture and delivery of 100 million doses of NVX-CoV2373 to the U.S. government. We expect this funding will assist in rapidly developing our large-scale manufacturing capacity and transitioning into ongoing production, including the capability to stockpile and distribute large quantities of NVX-CoV2373 for use in clinical trials and for commercial sale. The OWS Agreement is funding the late-stage clinical studies necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of NVX-CoV2373, including PREVENT-19. Funding under the OWS Agreement supported our file submission for EUA with the FDA and is expected to support our plans to submit a BLA with the FDA. Accepted analytical methods that we can use to demonstrate our vaccine’s purity, potency, and consistent lot manufacturing are critical to attaining licensure in all the territories we intend to sell our vaccine. In the U.S., these analytical methods will be reviewed and approved by the FDA. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's OWS agreement was amended to increase the contract ceiling by $52.9 million for a revised total of $1.8 billion. The agreement’s authorized funding and scope remains unchanged at $1.75 billion for support of certain activities related to the development of NVX-CoV2373 and the manufacture and delivery of 100 million doses of the vaccine candidate to the U.S. government. The Company and the U.S. government will determine the timing and amounts for delivery of NVX-CoV2373 doses upon U.S authorization and the Company intends to pursue additional U.S. procurement agreements for supply of NVX-CoV2373 doses. In July 2021, the U.S. government instructed us to prioritize alignment with the FDA on our analytic methods before conducting additional U.S. manufacturing and further indicated that the U.S. government will not fund additional U.S. manufacturing until such agreement has been made. The U.S. government also instructed us to proceed with work under the OWS Agreement related to all other activities including ongoing clinical trials and nonclinical studies, regulatory interactions, analytics/assays, and characterization of manufactured vaccine and project management. In October 2021 and January 2022, the U.S. government extended the prescribed time to meet its July 2021 instructions until April 2022. 
In February 2022, the Company’s Project Agreement with ATI was modified to include a Phase 3 efficacy study with respect to 2019n-CoV-301 in adolescents with a booster component and accordingly, the performance period under the Project Agreement was extended to December 31, 2023.
A summary and status of our historical COVID-19 funding developments follows:
Seasonal Influenza
NanoFlu Program (Older Adults)
Influenza is a world-wide infectious disease with serious illness generally occurring in more susceptible populations such as children under and older adults, but also occurring in the general population. According to a 2021 Fortune Business Insights research report forecast of influenza vaccines, the market for seasonal influenza vaccines is expected to grow from approximately $6.6 billion in 2021 to approximately $10.73 billion in 2028.
In September 2021, the final analysis of the primary endpoint of our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for the NanoFlu Program was published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. We previously announced that the NanoFlu Program achieved the trial’s primary endpoints, demonstrating non-inferior immunogenicity to Fluzone® Quadrivalent against all four influenza virus strains included in the vaccine, while also showing both enhanced wild-type hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody responses against homologous strains (22-66% increased) and six heterologous A/H3N2 strains (34-46% increased) as compared to Fluzone® Quadrivalent. Additionally, the NanoFlu Program showed potent induction of polyfunctional antigen-specific CD4+ T-cells against A(H3N2) and B/Victoria strains, with a 126–189% increase in various post vaccination cell-mediated immunity markers as compared to Fluzone® Quadrivalent.
Combination Vaccines
Our NanoFlu Program team remains focused on advancing combination vaccine candidates. With the ongoing development of NanoFlu Program, NVX-CoV2373, and our RSV Program, a strong rationale exists for developing combination respiratory vaccines designed to protect susceptible populations against these diseases.
COVID / Influenza Combination Vaccine
Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of COVID-Influenza Combination Vaccine 
In October 2021, we completed enrollment of our Phase 1/2 study in Australia, which we initiated in September 2021. The trial enrolled 642 healthy adults aged 50 to 70 years across 10 sites and will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immune response of a combination vaccine using NanoFlu Program and NVX-CoV2373, combined with our Matrix-M™ adjuvant. Participants have been either previously infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 or vaccinated through an authorized vaccine at least eight weeks prior to enrollment. All participants will be randomly assigned to cohorts to evaluate multiple formulations and will be administered doses on Day 0 and again at Day 56. Data from this Phase 1/2 trial are expected in the second quarter of 2022. Data from this Phase 1/2 trial are expected in April of 2022. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for the COVID-Influenza combination vaccine and NanoFlu Program as a standalone vaccine in the second half of 2022.
In May 2021, we announced data from a preclinical study of qNIV/CoV2373 to assess its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in animal models. Preclinical data from this study showed that qNIV/CoV2373 induced functional influenza and COVID-19 antibody responses, with hemagglutination inhibition and ACE2 receptor-inhibiting titers that were comparable between immunization with the combination vaccine and with its respective component vaccines. qNIV/CoV2373 also induced elevated levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG two weeks after the first immunization, which increased significantly after the second dose, with levels comparable to animals that received NVX-CoV2373 alone. Human ACE2 receptor inhibiting antibody levels responded similarly. qNIV/CoV2373 also induced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing epitopes that are common between the original COVID-19 strain and the Beta (B.1.351) variant strain. When challenged with SARS-CoV-2, examination of viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tract showed little or no virus was detected four days after infection in animals immunized with either qNIV/CoV2373 or with NVX-CoV2373 alone. Data from this study are available ahead of publication via the preprint server for biology on bioRxiv.
Respiratory Syncytial Virus ("RSV") 
Currently, there is no approved RSV vaccine available to combat the estimated 64 million RSV infections that occur globally each year. Older adults (60 years and older) are at increased risk for RSV disease due in part to immunosenescence, the age-related decline in the human immune system. RSV infection can also lead to exacerbation of underlying co-morbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and congestive heart failure.
RSV Program (Older Adults)
Previous clinical development through a Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated that our RSV Program for older adults with either aluminum phosphate or our proprietary Matrix-MTM adjuvant increased the magnitude, duration and quality of the immune response versus the non-adjuvanted RSV F Vaccine. We continue to assess the development opportunities for our RSV Program for older adults.
Malaria
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by a parasite that infects mosquitos subsequently transmitted to humans. According to the 2021 WHO World Malaria Report, in 2020, there was an estimated 241 million malaria cases and 627 thousand deaths worldwide in 2020. We believe malaria has the potential to be preventable through the R21 vaccine candidate, which is being developed through several partner-led trials and is formulated with our Matrix-MTM adjuvant. 
R21 - Malaria Vaccine
R21 is a malaria vaccine candidate created by the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, and formulated with our Matrix-M™ adjuvant. The University of Oxford has granted SIIPL a license for R21. We expect to manufacture and supply the Matrix-M™ adjuvant component of R21 to SIIPL. SIIPL has committed to manufacture at least 200 million doses per year of R21 after licensure, if granted. Additionally, SIIPL has rights to use Matrix-M™ adjuvant in R21 in regions where the disease is endemic and will pay royalties to us on its market sales of the vaccine. We will have commercial rights to sell and distribute the SIIPL-manufactured R21 in certain countries, primarily in the travelers’ and military vaccine markets.
R21 Clinical Development
R21 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 licensure trial initiated in May 2021. Data from this trial are expected in the second half of 2022. Previously, in April 2021, data from the Phase 2b trial evaluating R21 was published in The Lancet, demonstrating 77% efficacy when formulated with 50 micrograms of Matrix-MTM adjuvant and 71% efficacy when formulated with 25 micrograms of Matrix-MTM adjuvant. Both adjuvant dose levels were well tolerated in young children, with no severe reactions to R21 reported.
Advance Purchase Agreements (“APA”)
We have entered into APAs (also referred to as “supply agreements” throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K) with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (“Gavi”), the EC, and various countries globally. The APAs typically contain terms that include upfront payments intended to assist us in funding investments related to building out and operating our manufacturing and distribution network, among other expenses, in support of our global supply commitment. Such upfront payments generally become non-refundable upon our achievement of certain development milestones. We expect to sign additional APAs that are currently in active discussions and negotiations.
A summary of our APAs follows:
(1) The APA includes an option to order additional doses as may be required from time to time.
Under the terms of our APA with Gavi, 1.1 billion doses of NVX-CoV2373 are to be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility, which was established to allocate and distribute vaccines equitably to participating countries and economies. We expect to manufacture and distribute 350 million doses of NVX-CoV2373 to countries participating under the COVAX Facility. Under a separate purchase agreement with Gavi, SIIPL is expected to manufacture and deliver the balance of the 1.1 billion doses of NVX-CoV2373 for low- and middle-income countries participating in the COVAX Facility. We expect to deliver doses with antigen and Matrix-MTM adjuvant manufactured at facilities directly funded by the investments previously received from CEPI (the “CEPI Funding Agreement”). We expect to supply significant doses that Gavi would allocate to low-, middle-, and high-income countries, subject to certain limitations, utilizing a tiered pricing schedule and Gavi may prioritize such doses to low- and middle-income countries at lower prices. Additionally, we may provide additional doses of NVX-CoV2373, to the extent available from CEPI-funded manufacturing facilities, in the event that SIIPL cannot materially deliver expected vaccine doses to the COVAX Facility. Together with SIIPL, we expect to initiate delivery of doses following receipt of appropriate regulatory authorizations. Under the agreement, we received an upfront payment from Gavi of $350 million in 2021 and recorded a receivable as of December 31, 2021, for an additional payment of $350 million because we secured EUL for NVX-CoV2373 from the WHO in December 2021.
Under the terms of our APA with the EC, acting on behalf of various E.U. member states, we are committed to supply a minimum of 20 million and up to 100 million initial doses of NVX-CoV2373, with the option for the EC to purchase an additional 100 million doses through 2023. We have received orders for 69 million doses under this agreement.
License and Collaboration
Our commitment to partnering globally in efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic is demonstrated through our partnership with SIIPL to supply NVX-CoV2373 to India and low- and middle-income countries. In August 2020, we expanded upon our manufacturing and supply capabilities to include partnerships with both Takeda in Japan and SK bioscience in South Korea and furthered these collaborations in February and December 2021. These additional partnerships will increase our production capacity and are expected to support a rapid roll-out of NVX-CoV2373 globally.
(1) Geographies pending regulatory authorizations and not yet authorized under the brand name
(2) SK bioscience received non-exclusive licenses in Thailand and Vietnam
A summary of our license and collaboration agreements follows:
SIIPL
In July 2020, we entered into a supply and license agreement with SIIPL, which was amended in September 2020 and amended and restated in July 2021, under which we granted exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to SIIPL for the development, co-formulation, filling and finishing, registration, and commercialization of NVX-CoV2373. SIIPL agreed to purchase our Matrix-MTM adjuvant and we granted SIIPL a non-exclusive license to manufacture the antigen drug substance component of NVX-CoV2373 in SIIPL’s licensed territory solely for use in the manufacture of NVX-CoV2373. We will equally split the revenue from SIIPL's sale of NVX-CoV2373 in its licensed territory, net of agreed costs. We granted to SIIPL (i) an exclusive license in India during the agreement, and (ii) a non-exclusive license (a) during the “Pandemic Period” (as declared by the World Health Organization), in all countries other than specified countries designated by the World Bank as upper-middle or high-income countries, with respect to which we retains rights, and (b) after the Pandemic Period, in only those countries designated as low or middle-income by the World Bank. Following the Pandemic Period, we may notify SIIPL of any bona fide opportunities for us to license NVX-CoV2373 to a third party in such low and middle-income countries and SIIPL would have an opportunity to match or improve such third-party terms, failing which, we would have the discretion to remove one or more non-exclusive countries from SIIPL’s license. In October 2021, we entered into a supply agreement and a contract development manufacturing agreement with SIIPL and Serum Life Sciences Limited (“SLS”) under which SIIPL and SLS will supply us with NVX-CoV2373 for commercialization and sale in certain territories.
Takeda
In February 2021, we finalized a collaboration and license agreement with Takeda under which we granted Takeda an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize NVX-CoV2373 in Japan. Under the agreement, Takeda purchases Matrix-M™ adjuvant from us to manufacture doses of finished NVX-CoV2373 and we are entitled to receive payments from Takeda based on the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones, as well as a portion of net profits from the sale of NVX-CoV2373. In September 2021, Takeda finalized an agreement with MHLW for the purchase of 150 million doses of NVX-CoV2373. The announcement followed an update from MHLW on its ongoing efforts to secure coronavirus vaccine for the citizens of Japan. These efforts include vaccine procurement by Takeda pursuant to the terms of the collaboration and license agreement we entered into with Takeda in February 2021. Distribution of our vaccine in Japan by Takeda is expected to begin in 2022, pending regulatory approval. Takeda anticipates the capacity to manufacture 150 million doses of NVX-CoV2373 per year.
SK bioscience
In February 2021, we finalized an expanded collaboration and license agreement with SK bioscience to manufacture and commercialize NVX-CoV2373 for sale to the government of Korea. Concurrently, SK bioscience finalized an advance purchase agreement with the Korean government to supply 40 million doses of NVX-CoV2373 to the Republic of Korea beginning in 2021. Our agreement is in addition to our existing manufacturing arrangement with SK bioscience entered into in August 2020. Under the collaboration agreement, SK bioscience was granted an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize NVX-CoV2373 in the Republic of Korea. SK bioscience will pay a tiered royalty in the low to middle double-digit range on the sale of NVX-CoV2373 in the Republic of Korea. In May 2021, we entered a non-binding 
Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Korea and SK bioscience to explore further cooperation in the development and manufacturing of vaccines, including NVX-CoV2373 and to potentially explore the development of new vaccine products with SK bioscience, including COVID-19 variant vaccines and/or an influenza/COVID-19 combination vaccine. In December 2021, we amended the collaboration and license agreement to grant a non-exclusive license to cover Thailand and Vietnam, subject to a low to middle double-digit royalty, and for SK biosciences to supply the antigen component of NVX-CoV2373 to us for use in the final drug product globally, including product distributed by the COVAX Facility. 
Manufacturing and Supply
We are committed to discovering, developing, and commercializing innovative vaccines to prevent serious infectious diseases and are exploring a number of combination vaccine candidates, including a COVID-influenza combination vaccine directly and by leveraging our strategic global partnerships. In 2021 and 2020, we established a global supply chain to support the commercialization of NVX-CoV2373. The acquisition of Novavax CZ (formerly Praha Vaccines, a.s.) in the Czech Republic in May 2020 demonstrated the Company’s first major step toward building out our global manufacturing capabilities. Since May 2020, we have established partnerships worldwide to amplify and solidify our global reach.
To date, we have increased our projected global manufacturing production rate of NVX-CoV2373 to be over two billion annualized doses when we are at full capacity. Of this anticipated capacity, approximately one billion doses will be manufactured by SIIPL.
A summary of our key manufacturing and supply arrangements follows:
Matrix-MTM Adjuvant
We manufacture our proprietary saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant at our Novavax AB facility in Uppsala, Sweden. 
In June 2020, we entered into contract manufacturing arrangements with AGC Biologics and the Polypeptide Group to provide contract development and manufacturing services, supplying us with large-scale production of Matrix-M™ adjuvant.
Antigen Component of NVX-CoV2373
In October 2021, we entered into a supply agreement with SIIPL and SLS, an affiliate of SIIPL, for the manufacture of NVX-CoV2373. In October 2021, we also entered into a contract development manufacture agreement with SLS, where SLS will manufacture and supply finished vaccine product to us using antigen drug substance and Matrix-M™ adjuvant supplied by us.
In October 2021, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with Mabion S.A. (“Mabion”) for the large-scale manufacturing of NVX-CoV2373 through 2026. This agreement follows the successful completion of technology transfer to Mabion for antigen production of NVX-CoV2373. We are scaling up manufacturing of NVX-CoV2373 at Mabion’s Good Manufacturing Practice-certified facility located near Warsaw, Poland.
In August 2021, we extended our partnership with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies through an agreement for long-term commercial manufacturing of NVX-CoV2373 through 2025. Under this agreement, FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies has continued to manufacture the antigen component of NVX-CoV2373 at its sites in Morrisville, North Carolina, College Station, Texas, and Billingham, UK. This development follows a previous manufacturing agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies, which we entered into in July 2020.
In June 2021, we announced the completion of construction of the National Research Council of Canada’s Biologics Manufacturing Centre and ongoing technology transfer for the production of NVX-CoV2373. Technology transfer to establish a step-by-step process of producing NVX-CoV2373 at the Biologics Manufacturing Centre began in April 2021 following a collaboration agreement entered into with the National Research Council of Canada in March 2021. These developments build upon a MOU entered into in February 2021 with the Canadian government to produce NVX-CoV2373 at 
the Biologics Manufacturing Centre in Canada. Large-scale GMP production is expected to begin once the facility has received Health Canada approval.
Pursuant to our APA with Gavi, we have licensed our NVX-CoV2373 technology to SIIPL and are jointly committed with SIIPL to deliver the 1.1 billion doses to the COVAX Facility. We expect to supply doses to Gavi utilizing a tiered pricing schedule.
In July 2020, we announced a manufacturing agreement with FDB allowing for the large-scale contract production of NVX-CoV2373 in connection with our OWS Agreement, beginning at FDB’s North Carolina facility.
Competition in COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV
The vaccine market is intensely competitive, characterized by rapid technological progress. Our technology is based upon utilizing the baculovirus expression system in insect cells to make recombinant vaccines. Our Matrix-M™ adjuvant has demonstrated a potent and well-tolerated effect by stimulating the entry of antigen-presenting cells into the injection site and enhancing antigen presentation in local lymph nodes, boosting immune response. We believe this baculovirus expression system offers many advantages when compared to other technologies and is uniquely well-suited for developing COVID-19, influenza, and RSV vaccines, as well as vaccines against a number of other infectious diseases.
A number of vaccine manufacturers, research institutions, and other organizations are developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. A variety of different vaccine technologies are being studied, including nucleic acid (RNA/DNA), viral vectors, live attenuated or inactivated, and protein-based vaccines. According to a coronavirus vaccine tracker published by The New York Times, updated as of February 23, 2022, there are 115 vaccines in clinical trials and 49 have reached the final stages of testing. As of January 2022, Novavax is one of five manufacturers that have a COVID-19 vaccine that has received Conditional Marketing Authorization by the EMA in the European Union, with the other manufacturers being Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. As of January 2022, Pfizer has received BLA approval and Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have each received EUA by the FDA in the U.S for their COVID-19 vaccines. As of January 2022, we submitted for EUA by the FDA for NVX-CoV2373, marking the first protein-based COVID-19 vaccine filing. Based on NVX-CoV2373’s high efficacy against both the original and variant strains and its well-tolerated profile demonstrated in clinical trials, including two pivotal Phase 3 trials in the U.K. and U.S., we believe our vaccine candidate will play an important role in addressing this global public health crisis. 
A number of companies are developing and selling vaccines for seasonal influenza employing both traditional (egg-based) and new vaccine technologies (cell-based). Many seasonal influenza vaccines are currently approved and marketed, and most of these are marketed by major pharmaceutical companies such as Sanofi Pasteur, GSK and Seqirus. Competition in the sale of seasonal influenza vaccines is intense. For the older adult segment, Sanofi currently supplies Fluzone-HD® and Flublok® to the majority of older adults in the U.S. Therefore, newly developed and approved products must be differentiated from existing vaccines in order to have commercial success. In order to show differentiation in the seasonal influenza market, a product may need to be more efficacious and/or be less expensive and quicker to manufacture, all while still showing a comparable or improved tolerability profile. Many of our competitors are working on new products and new generations of current products, some by adding an adjuvant that is used to increase the immunogenicity of that product, each of which is intended to be more efficacious than currently marketed products. Several competitors are working on developing seasonal influenza vaccines using different technologies than those in existing marketed vaccines, the most notable being mRNA. Despite the significant competition and advancing technologies, based on our completed Phase 3 trial results, we believe that NanoFlu Program, our adjuvanted nanoparticle seasonal influenza product could be as efficacious as, or more so than, current products or products being developed by our competitors.
There is currently no approved RSV vaccine for sale in the world; however, a number of vaccine manufacturers, academic institutions and other organizations currently have, or have had, programs to develop such a vaccine. These groups are developing products to prevent disease caused by RSV using a variety of technology platforms, including viral vectors, nucleic acid (RNA/DNA), live attenuated chimeric, antigens or monoclonal antibodies (“Mab”) and competitive recombinant technologies. We continue to believe that our RSV F Vaccine candidate, which is a recombinant prefusogenic F-protein nanoparticle, is likely to be as effective as other RSV vaccine candidates or other products in development by our competitors. At this time, there are a number of companies and other organizations with vaccine candidates in late-stage clinical trials. In older adults, GSK, Pfizer, and Janssen are in Phase 3 trials. GSK and Pfizer both are in Phase 3 trials for infants via maternal immunization. Additionally, both the AstraZeneca / Sanofi partnered monoclonal antibody and Merck monoclonal antibody are in Phase 3 trials in infants. 
In general, competition among pharmaceutical products is based in part on product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position. An important factor is the relative timing of the market introduction of our products and our competitors’ products. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical trials and 
approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is an important competitive factor. Our competitive position also may depend upon our ability to show differentiation with a product that is more efficacious and/or less expensive and quicker to manufacture. Other factors affecting our competitive position include our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the lengthy period between technological conception and commercial sale.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We generally seek patent protection for our technology and product candidates in the U.S. and abroad. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Our success will depend, in part, on whether we can:
•obtain patents to protect our own technologies and product candidates;
•obtain licenses to use the technologies of third-parties, which may be protected by patents;
•protect our trade secrets and know-how; and
•operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others.
Patent Rights; Licenses.
We have intellectual property (patents, licenses, know-how) related to our vaccines, manufacturing processes and other technologies. Currently, we have or have rights to over 550 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications relating to vaccines and vaccine-related technologies.
Patents related to our Virus-Like Particle (“VLP”) program include U.S. Patent No. 7,763,450, which covers, in part, the use of influenza gene sequences for high-yield production of consistent influenza VLP vaccines to protect against current and future seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza viruses. Corresponding European patent, European Patent No. 1644037 also covers this technology. U.S. Patent Nos. 8,080,255, 8,551,756, 8,506,967 and 8,592,197 are directed to methods of producing VLPs and inducing substantial immunity to an influenza virus infection by administering VLPs comprising HA and NA proteins, and our M1 protein derived from the avian influenza strain, A/Indonesia/5/05. Certain claims also encompass similar methods and compositions where the M1 protein is from a different strain of influenza virus than the influenza HA protein and the influenza NA protein. Related patent protection in Europe is provided by European Patent No. 2343084, which covers, in part, vaccine compositions containing VLPs that contain M1, HA, and NA proteins. Our VLP patent portfolio contains many other patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 8,951,537, 8,992,939, 9,144,607, 9,050,290, 9,180,180, 9,381,239, 9,464,276, 9,474,799, and other patents in multiple ex-U.S. jurisdictions.
We also have been issued patents directed to other core programs, including our RSV and influenza programs. Issued patents directed to various aspects of the RSV program include U.S. Patent Nos. 8,715,692, 9,675,685, 9,731,000, 9,717,786, 10,022,437, and 10,426,829. Additional patents in the family include EP237009 in Europe, as well as others throughout the world. Patents related to our rabies program include 9,724,405 and 10,086,065 in the U.S., and EP2635257 and EP3246019 in Europe. Related patents have been issued in other world markets. Issued patents in our influenza nanoparticle program include US Patent No. 10,426,829. In addition to our focus on vaccine programs, we also pursue patent protection for our Matrix Adjuvant program. Issued U.S. Patent Nos. 7,838,019, 9,205,147, 9,901,634, 8,821,881, and 10,729,764 provide examples of patents related to our Matrix Adjuvant program.
We pursue patents related to NVX-CoV2373, our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Our applications include PCT/US2021/015220 and U.S. Serial No. 16,997,001, which the U.S Patent Office has allowed. 
We continue to prepare, file, and prosecute patent applications to provide broad and strong protection of our proprietary rights, including next generation applications focused on our RSV Program, our influenza nanoparticle program, and our adjuvant program.
The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and related statutory guidance encourages the dissemination of science and technology innovation. While our expired contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (“DHHS”), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“HHS BARDA”) provided us with the right to retain ownership in our inventions that may have arisen during performance of that contract, with respect to certain other collaborative research efforts with the U.S. government, certain developments and results that may have commercial potential are to be freely published, not treated as confidential, and we may be required to negotiate a license to developments and results in order to commercialize products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain any such license at a reasonable cost, or that such development and results will not be made available to our competitors on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis.
Trade Secrets
We also rely significantly on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. It is our policy to require employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, collaborators and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting or collaborative relationships with us. We also require confidentiality agreements from any entity that is to receive confidential information from us. With respect to employees, consultants and contractors, the agreements generally provide that all inventions made by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as our property.
Government Regulations
The development, production and marketing of biological products, which include the vaccine candidates being developed by Novavax or our collaborators, are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. Although we focus on the U.S. regulatory process and the standards imposed by the FDA, the International Conference on Harmonisation (“ICH”) and other agencies because we believe meeting U.S. and ICH standards generally allows us to satisfy regulatory agencies in other countries where we intend to do business; however, we are mindful that expectations in some venues, notably in the European Union and the United Kingdom (in relation to Great Britain), differ to some degree and we take proactive steps to address such differences by maintaining regular filings and correspondence and attending regular meetings with many other non-U.S. regulatory agencies. In the U.S., the development, manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals and vaccines are subject to extensive regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and biological products are subject to regulation under provisions of that act and the Public Health Service Act. The FDA not only assesses the safety and efficacy of these products but it also regulates, among other things, the testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion of such products. The process of obtaining FDA licensure for a new vaccine is costly and time-consuming.
Vaccine clinical development in most countries follows the same general regulatory pathway as drugs and other biologics. Before applying for FDA licensure to market any new vaccine candidate, we expect to first submit an investigational new drug application (“IND”) that explains to the FDA, among other things, the results of preclinical toxicology testing conducted in laboratory animals, the method of manufacture, quality control tests for release, the stability of the investigational product and what we propose to do for human testing. At this stage, the FDA decides whether it is reasonably safe to move forward with testing the vaccine candidate in humans. We must then conduct Phase 1 clinical trials and larger-scale Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials that demonstrate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of our vaccine candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. Following successful completion of all three phases of clinical development, a BLA can be submitted to the FDA requesting licensure of the vaccine for marketing based on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy. Similar pathways exist in Europe and other geographies.
The FDA will only approve a BLA if the vaccine is demonstrated to be safe, pure and potent. During the FDA’s review of a BLA, the proposed manufacturing facility undergoes a pre-approval inspection during which the FDA examines in detail the production of the vaccine, the manufacturing facility and the quality documentation related to the vaccine. Vaccine licensure also requires the provision of adequate product labeling to allow health care providers to understand the vaccine’s proper use, including its potential benefits and risks, to communicate with patients and parents, and to safely deliver the vaccine to the public. Until a vaccine is given to the general population, all potential adverse events cannot be anticipated. Thus, the FDA typically requires Phase 4 post-marketing clinical trials for vaccines after licensure to continue gathering safety, and sometimes effectiveness/efficacy data in the indicated and additional populations.
The Commissioner of the FDA may, under delegated authority from the Secretary of the DHHS, and under certain circumstances, issue an EUA, that would permit the use of an unapproved medical product or unapproved use of an approved medical product to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. When issuing an EUA, the FDA imposes conditions of authorization, with which the EUA holder must comply. Such conditions include, but may not be limited to, compliance with labeling, distribution of materials designed to ensure proper use, reporting obligations, and restrictions on advertising and promotion. The EUA is only effective for the duration of the public health emergency. The FDA may also revise or revoke the EUA sooner if, the criteria for issuance are no longer met or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety. For example, an EUA may be revoked when the FDA determines that the underlying public health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, or for reasons such as significant adverse inspectional findings, reports of adverse events linked to or suspected of being caused by the EUA product, or newly emerging data that may demonstrate the product may not be effective.
In order to ensure continuing safety, the FDA and most other non-U.S. based regulatory agencies continue to oversee the production of vaccines even after the vaccine and manufacturing processes are approved. For example, monitoring of the vaccine and of production activities, including periodic facility inspections, must continue as long as the manufacturer holds a license for the product. Manufacturers may also be required to submit the results of their own tests for 
potency, safety and purity for each vaccine lot, if requested by the relevant regulatory agency. They may also be required to submit samples of each vaccine lot to the agency for testing.
In addition to obtaining FDA licensure for each product, each domestic manufacturing establishment must be registered with the FDA, is subject to FDA inspection and must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) regulations. To supply products for use either in the U.S. or outside the U.S., including clinical trials, U.S. and foreign manufacturing establishments, including third-party facilities, must comply with GMP regulations and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA or by corresponding regulatory agencies in their home country.
The EU and the U.K. similarly provide a faster means to achieve approval by offering conditional marketing authorizations which are granted with the proviso of obtaining additional data to eventually become unconditional, but which allow authorization to be granted earlier albeit with a more limited set of clinical data.
The FDA has several programs designed to expedite the development and approval of drugs and biological products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation, and accelerated approval. First, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have more frequent interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. The FDA granted Fast Track Designation for NVX-CoV2373 in November 2020 and for NanoFlu, our recombinant quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine candidate, in January 2020.
Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The FDA may hold meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; provide timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involve more senior staff in the review process; assign a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and take other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious disease or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and, for a drug product (including a vaccine), to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
Fourth, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to confirm efficacy using a clinically meaningful endpoint, thereby confirming efficacy observed pre-approval using a surrogate endpoint. In June 2019, we announced that the FDA acknowledged that the accelerated approval pathway is available for NanoFlu.
In addition to regulatory approvals that must be obtained in the U.S., an investigational product is also subject to regulatory approval in other countries in which it is intended to be marketed. No such product can be marketed in a country until the regulatory authorities of that country have approved an appropriate marketing application. FDA licensure does not guarantee approval by other regulatory authorities. In addition, in many countries, the government is involved in the pricing of the product. In such cases, the pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted.
We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations, including national and local regulations that govern our facility in Sweden. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by our operations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. 
In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. Additionally, for formulations containing controlled substances, we are subject to Drug Enforcement Act regulations.
In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities or programs, private health insurers (including managed care plans) and other organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the product is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective at certain prices. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available in certain markets to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Third-party payors may also control access to, or manage utilization of, our products with various utilization management techniques. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payer to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
Within the U.S., if we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our product candidates, those products could potentially be covered by various government health benefit programs as well as purchased by government agencies. The participation in such programs or the sale of products to such agencies is subject to regulation. In exchange for coverage, we may be obligated to provide rebates or offer discounts under government health programs or to government and private purchasers.
The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, including initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (“Healthcare Reform Act”) which includes changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government health care programs. Under the Trump administration, there were several efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act, and some modifications were implemented. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Healthcare Reform Act was enacted. For example, through the process created by the Budget Control Act of 2011, there are automatic reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 due to subsequent legislative amendments contained in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, commonly referred to as the “CARES Act”. In November 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued an interim final rule that seeks to lower prescription drug costs by paying no more for certain Medicare Part B drugs than the lowest price paid for such drugs in certain other countries (the "Most Favored Nation Rule”). Under the rule, the lower payment rates for affected drugs would be phased in over a period of four years, beginning in 2021. The rule has been challenged by industry associations on a number of grounds. On December 28, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction in Biotechnology Innovation Organization v. Azar, No. 3:20-cv-08603, which preliminarily enjoins CMS from implementing the Most Favored Nation Rule. Given this preliminary injunction, the Most Favored Nation Rule was not implemented on January 1, 2021 and will not be implemented without further rule-making. However, this interim final rule or any similar type of reference pricing regulation could potentially harm our business if expanded to include our products.
Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny in the U.S. of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been several recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices or price increases. Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our product candidates if approved for sale. It is also possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
Similarly, in many countries outside the U.S., pharmaceutical pricing is subject to regulatory control, particularly in countries where healthcare is provided mainly through government funding or government backed insurers. In such countries governmental organizations will generally determine firstly if a medicinal product might be reimbursed and secondly the maximum price payable. 
Within the U.S., we may be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, for activities related to future sales of any of our product candidates that may in the future receive regulatory and marketing approval. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a pharmaceutical manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase, prescription or use of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under such anti-kickback laws. False claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In the U.S., federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the FCA. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. 
On November 20, 2020, the DHHS published a Final Rule entitled “Removal of Safe Harbor Protection for Rebates to Plans or PBMs Involving Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Creation of New Safe Harbor Protection,” commonly referred to as the “Rebate Rule”, which amends the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor by eliminating protection for price concessions, including rebates, that are offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors, or pharmacy benefit managers under contract with them, under the Medicare Part D program and Medicare Advantage Plans, unless the price reduction is one required by law. Effective January 1, 2022, in advance of the calendar year 2022 Part D plan year, safe harbor protection will be eliminated for manufacturer rebates paid directly (or indirectly through a pharmacy benefit manager) to Part D prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans. Effective December 30, 2020, the Rebate Rule established two new safe harbors. The first new safe harbor protects price reductions paid by manufacturers to prescription drug plans (including prescription drug plans offered by Medicare Advantage organizations) and Medicaid managed care organizations, which are fully reflected at the point-of-sale. The second new safe harbor protects fair-market-value service fees paid to pharmacy benefit managers by manufacturers. This new rule could result in a change in incentives for health plans and pharmacy benefit managers in negotiating rebates and discounts with manufactures for preferred formulary placement. At this time we cannot predict how these changes will impact our business and operations once our product candidates are commercialized.
Within the European Union and the United Kingdom, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States and the United Kingdom, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. 
We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions. Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside the U.S. or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. As we expand our presence outside the U.S., it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs. We cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants, or our third-party contractors are or will be in compliance with all federal, state, and foreign regulations regarding bribery and corruption. Moreover, our strategic collaborators and third-party contractors located outside the U.S. may have inadequate compliance programs or may fail to respect the laws and guidance of the territories in which they operate. The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on 
U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations, impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, for covered entities, or certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates that provide services to the covered entity that involve individually identifiable health information and their subcontractors that use, disclose or otherwise process individually identifiable health information. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA. While pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are typically not directly regulated by HIPAA, our business may be indirectly impacted by HIPAA in our interactions with providers, payors, and others that have HIPAA compliance obligations. We are also subject to state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health or personal information such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”).
There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, for payments made by them to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report information related to payments and other transfers of value provided in the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives. 
Within the European Union and the United Kingdom, payments made to physicians must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must in some countries be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, their competent professional organization, or the regulatory authorities of the individual country. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the European Union Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines, or imprisonment.
Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers and/or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, any future activities (if we obtain approval and/or reimbursement from federal healthcare programs for our product candidates) could be subject to challenge.
Given the significant global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that one or more government entities may take actions, including the U.S. government under the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, which could directly or indirectly have the effect of diminishing some of our rights or opportunities with respect to NVX-CoV2373 and the economic value of a COVID-19 vaccine to us could be limited. In addition, during a global health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where the spread of a disease needs to be controlled, closed or heavily regulated national borders will create challenges and potential delays in our development and production activities and may necessitate that we pursue strategies to develop and produce our vaccine candidates within self-contained national or international borders, at potentially much greater expense and with longer timeframes for public distribution.
We face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. In the United States, the Public 
Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (the “PREP Act”), provides immunity for manufacturers from all claims under state or federal law for "loss" arising out of the administration or use of a “covered countermeasure.” However, injured persons may still bring a suit for "willful misconduct" against the manufacturer under some circumstances. "Covered countermeasures" include security countermeasures and "qualified pandemic or epidemic products", including products intended to diagnose or treat pandemic or epidemic disease, such as pandemic vaccines, as well as treatments intended to address conditions caused by such products. For these immunities to apply, the Secretary of DHHS must issue a declaration in cases of public health emergency or “credible risk” of a future public health emergency. On March 17, 2020, the Secretary of DHHS issued a declaration under the PREP Act and has issued subsequent amendments thereto since then to provide liability immunity for activities related to certain countermeasures against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While we believe our products would be covered under the provisions of the PREP Act, this cannot be assured. 
Also, there can be no assurance that the Secretary of the HHS will make other declarations in the future that cover any of our other product candidates or that the U.S. Congress will not act in the future to reduce coverage under the PREP Act or to repeal it altogether. If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.
Human Capital
Employees
As of February 21, 2022, we have 1,541 full-time employees, of whom 198 hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees and 499 of whom hold other advanced degrees. Of our total workforce, 1,088 employees are engaged primarily in research, development, and manufacturing activities and 453 employees are engaged primarily in executive, business development, commercial, finance and accounting, legal, and administrative functions. None of our U.S. or Czech employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements; 135 of our 136 Swedish employees are covered by typical collective bargaining agreements.
To nurture, grow, and treat our employees fairly is imbued in our culture. We are proud to have been recognized in the 2021 Top Workplaces USA list based on employee surveys. We believe this award reflects our investment in an exceptional work culture. 
Employee Safety and Benefits
Employee safety is our highest priority. As we moved through the pandemic in 2021, we continued to encourage employees who were able to work from home to do so. We implemented a Covid Resources page on our intranet, which provides employees with information on Covid-19 safety, both inside and outside of the workplace. Resources on this site include our Covid-19 Protocols and Guide, our policies on face coverings and social distancing, a list of infection control measures, and mental wellness support resources. We implemented temperature screenings for everyone who enters our facilities and require visitors to complete a health assessment before entering.
Our 700 Quince Orchard office space located in Gaithersburg, Maryland is on track to receive WELL Platinum certification. WELL is the leading tool for advancing health and well-being in buildings globally. As one of 35 WELL certified buildings in North America, this building will meet rigorous standards for materials selection, indoor air quality, and acoustics. In addition, our operations and policies contribute to earning high marks in all the 10 WELL Concepts: Air, Water, Nourishment, Light, Movement, Thermal Comfort, Sound, Materials, Mind, and Community.
Compensation and Benefits; Health and Wellness
Our total rewards package is designed to attract, engage, motivate, and retain top talent. We strive to provide compensation, benefits, and services that help meet the varying needs of our employees. Our generous total rewards package includes competitive market pay and comprehensive benefits that are among the best in our industry, including insurance to protect and maintain health, income protection through our short- and long-term disability programs, adoption assistance and paid parental leave programs, and services to assist in balancing work and personal life, such as backup child, adult, and elder care, and financial wellbeing programs, including monthly financial wellness seminars, one-on-one financial planning sessions, and debt and credit management support. 
Our wellness initiatives include a monthly newsletter, which highlights organizations and partners, tools, and resources intended to help our employees lead healthier and happier lives. We offer several digital apps that allow our employees to connect to an online licensed therapist or to access activities that are designed to reduce stress and anxiety and 
increase mindfulness and emotional well-being. We have a robust employee assistance program for employees to access support for a variety of life events.
To assist employees with work/life balance, we provide employees with a concierge service to assist employees with tasks including, but not limited to: 
•finding and booking auto services;
•sourcing pet sitters and boarders;
•researching online and in-person tutors;
•suggesting community events;
•providing vacation ideas;
•finding and booking home cleaners, plumbers, HVAC, and landscaping services;
•finding and booking yoga, personal training sessions, and spin classes;
•suggesting nutritional meals and recipes; and
•researching day care center availability and ratings.
In addition, we offer every employee the benefit of equity ownership in the company through equity grants and participation in our employee stock purchase plan. We believe that equity compensation has been, and will continue to be, a critical component of our compensation package because it develops a culture of ownership among our employees and aligns their interests with the interests of our stockholders.
Recruitment, Development and Training
The attraction, development, and retention of employees is a critical success factor for our success. We utilize a variety of recruitment vehicles to source top talent, including strategic partnerships with search firms, leveraging social media channels, and a robust employee referral program. 
To support the growth and advancement of our employees, we offer tuition and continuing education reimbursement, and an array of training and professional development opportunities, including on-the-spot coaching with executive coaches and access to the LinkedIn Learning library of over 16,000 on-demand video tutorials that address skills, knowledge, and behaviors related to business, leadership, technology, and innovation. In the last 12 months, videos were viewed and completed over 25,000 times by our employees. We provide an Executive Development Program for employees identified as having high potential and for employees who have been identified as potential successors to leadership positions. Our Executive Development Program includes executive coaching engagements and leadership development programs designed to strengthen our leadership bench and accelerate and prepare our top talent for future growth. Professional development learning series are available to all employees and focus on self-awareness, collaboration, hybrid working, and business acumen.
Internal Communications
We employ a variety of tools to facilitate open and direct communication, including global forums with executives, employee surveys, and engagement through forums and committees. Our executive leadership team continues to recognize the importance of increased employee engagement.
Diversity and Inclusion
Our culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) enables us to create, develop, and fully leverage the strengths of our workforce to meet our growth objectives. We recently completed an evidence-based analysis of our current DEI state, resulting in a multi-year road map and strategy to drive diversity and inclusion by developing inclusive leaders, enabling an inclusive culture, and building diverse teams. The first annual Novavax Women’s Leadership Forum was successfully 
launched and resulted in building networks, developing skills, sharing voices and ideas, and becoming agents of positive change. We are focused on growing and maintaining our diverse workforce and we believe our DEI strategy will enable us to continuously improve and excel. In 2022, we hired a DEI and Employee Engagement Manager focused on actions to build an inclusive workforce, and we are investing in training to develop our leaders to access different perspectives when generating ideas and decision making.
