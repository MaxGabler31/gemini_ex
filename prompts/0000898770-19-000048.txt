COMPANY OVERVIEW
Sharps Compliance Corp. is a leading national healthcare waste management provider specializing in regulated waste streams including medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous. Our services facilitate the safe and proper collection, transportation and environmentally-responsible treatment of regulated waste from customers in multiple healthcare-related markets. The markets we manage are small to medium-size generators of healthcare waste including professional offices (ambulatory surgical centers, physician groups, dentists and veterinarians), assisted living and long-term care facilities, government agencies, home health care, retail clinics and immunizing pharmacies. Additionally, our mailback solutions are positioned to manage waste generated in the home setting such as sharps, lancets and ultimate-user medications which generates business relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other markets to provide safe and proper disposal. Lastly, we maintain a strong distribution network for the sale of our solutions within the aforementioned markets.
We assist our customers in determining solutions that best fit their needs for the collection, transportation and treatment of regulated medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous waste. Our differentiated approach provides our customers the flexibility to transport waste via direct route-based services, the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) or common carrier dependent upon quantity of waste generated, cost savings and facility needs. Our comprehensive services approach includes a single point of contact, consolidated billing, integrated manifest and proof of destruction repository. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive tracking and reporting tools that enable our customers to meet complex medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous waste disposal and compliance requirements. We believe the fully-integrated nature of our operations is a key factor leading to our success and continued recurring revenue growth.

Our flagship products are the Sharps Recovery System™ and MedSafe® Medication Disposal System. These two product offerings account for over 50% of company revenues. The Sharps Recovery System is a comprehensive medical waste management mailback solution used in all markets due to its cost-effective nature and nationwide availability. The MedSafe solution meets the immediate needs of an increasing community risk associated with unused, ultimate-user, medications. Developed in accordance with the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) implementation of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 (the “Act”), MedSafe is a superior solution used in both private and public sectors to properly remove medications from communities and aid in the prevention of drug abuse. 
Over the past few years, the Company has made a series of investments to build a robust direct service, route-based, pickup offering for medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous waste. We have built an infrastructure capable of covering more than 55% of the U.S. population with permitted trucks, transfer stations and treatment facilities. We continue to add routes and the infrastructure required for operational efficiency to reach more customers and prospects directly. Our route-based services, matched with comprehensive mailback solutions, offer us a key differentiator in the market and the ability to capitalize on larger or regional contracts within the healthcare market. With the growth in infrastructure to support the route-based service, we have strategically added new distribution for faster and more cost-effective delivery of products to customers. 
We continue to develop new solutions to meet market demands. Over the past five years we have added a robust portfolio of ultimate-user medication disposal solutions for controlled substances, DEA-inventory controlled medication disposal for professionals, the Black Pail Program for disposal of most unused inventory of drugs, route-based services for medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous waste, the TakeAway Recycle System™ for single-use devices ("SUDs") and the Hazardous Drug Spill Control Kit™, a USP <800> (as defined below) compliant spill kit for cleanup of chemotherapy and other hazardous drug spills.
As hospitals and surgery centers increase their sustainability efforts, they are looking for ways to recycle more materials, such as SUDs. SUDs are constructed of materials capable of being recycled, including plastics, metals, circuit boards and batteries. With a greater emphasis for more sustainable solutions, the TakeAway Recycle System is a much-needed complement to the single-use device market. 
We have developed a simple one-step program to safely and compliantly manage the unused inventory of pharmaceuticals. The Black Pail Program for Rx consists of one container for the disposal of excess drugs, including Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") hazardous medications, controlled pharmaceutical wastage, and non-controlled, non-hazardous medications.  
We are expanding our hazardous waste direct pickup service to all the states in which we currently pick up medical waste. Most healthcare professionals have hazardous waste in addition to medical waste. By also transporting hazardous waste, we have a competitive advantage over local haulers while still offering cost-effective pricing.
Our principal executive offices are located at 9220 Kirby Drive, Suite 500, Houston, Texas. Our telephone number at that location is (713) 432-0300. We currently have 159 full-time employees and 5 part-time employees. We have manufacturing, assembly, distribution and warehousing operations located in Houston, Texas. 
We own and operate a fully-permitted treatment facility in Carthage, Texas that incorporates our processing and treatment operations. The Carthage facility offers both steam sterilization, autoclave and high heat incineration for the proper treatment of regulated medical waste and non-hazardous pharmaceuticals. The autoclave system is utilized alongside the incinerator for day-to-day operations. The Carthage location also serves as the Company's main facility for managing our recycling solution. 
In August 2016, the Company received the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Waste Management permit for the processing of medical waste at its treatment facility located in northeastern Pennsylvania. The 40,000 square foot facility has been permitted as both a medical waste treatment facility, using an autoclave, and as a transfer station for medical, pharmaceutical and trace chemotherapy waste of up to 82 tons per day. The facility is designed to cost-effectively and efficiently process medical waste generated by the Company’s route-based and mailback customers and doubles as a distribution center of mailback solutions. It has been in operation since November 2016.

MARKET OVERVIEW
The Company continues to focus on core markets and solution offerings that fuel growth. Its key markets include healthcare facilities, pharmaceutical manufacturers, home healthcare providers, assisted living/long-term care, retail pharmacies and clinics and the professional market which is comprised of physicians, dentists, surgery centers and veterinary practices. These markets require cost-effective services for managing medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous waste.
The Company believes its growth opportunities are supported by the following:

• | A large professional market that consists of dentists, veterinarians, clinics, physician groups, urgent care facilities, ambulatory surgical centers and other healthcare facilities. This regulated market consists of small to medium quantity generators of medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous waste where we can offer a lower cost to service with solutions to match individual facility needs. The Company addresses this market from two directions: (i) field sales which focus on larger-dollar and nationwide opportunities where we can integrate the route-based pickup service along with our mailback solutions to create a comprehensive medical waste management offering and (ii) inside and online sales which focus on the individual or small group professional offices, government agencies, smaller retail pharmacies and clinics and assisted living/long term care facilities. The Company is able to compete more aggressively in the medium quantity generator market with the addition of route-based services where the mailback may not be as cost effective. The Company’s route-based business provides direct service to areas encompassing over 55% of the U.S. population.


• | From July 2015 to July 2016, the Company acquired three route-based pickup service companies, which strengthened the Company's position in the Northeast. Through a combination of acquisition and organic growth, the Company now offers route-based pickup services in a twenty-four (24) state region of the South, Southeast and Northeast portions of the United States. To facilitate operational efficiencies, the Company has opened transfer stations and offices in strategic locations. The Company directly serves more than 12,900 customer locations with route-based pickup services. With the addition of these route-based pickup regions and the network of medical and hazardous waste service providers servicing the entire U.S., the Company offers customers a blended product portfolio to effectively manage multi-site and multi-sized locations, including those that generate larger quantities of waste. The network has had a significant positive impact on our pipeline of sales opportunities - over 60% of this pipeline is attributable to opportunities providing comprehensive waste management service offerings where both the mailback and pickup service are integrated into the offering.


• | The changing demographics of the U.S. population – according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Population Estimates and National Projections, one out of five Americans will be 65 years or older by 2030, which will increase the need for cost-effective medical waste management solutions, especially in the long-term care and home healthcare markets. With multiple solutions for managing regulated healthcare-related waste, the Company delivers value as a single-source provider with blended mailback and route-based pickup services matched to the waste volumes of each facility.


• | The shift of healthcare from traditional settings to the retail pharmacy and clinic markets, where the Company focuses on driving increased promotion of the Sharps Recovery System. According to the Centers for Disease Control ("CDC"), 44.9% of U.S. adults received a flu shot and 32.2% of flu shots for adults were administered in a retail clinic in 2018. Over the flu seasons from 2011 to 2019, the Company saw growth in six years of 10% to 36%, including a 30% increase in 2019, and declines in three years of 13% to 17%. Despite the volatility, Sharps believes the Retail market should continue to contribute to long-term growth for the Company as consumers increasingly use alternative sites, such as retail pharmacies, to obtain flu and other immunizations.


• | The passage of regulations for ultimate-user medication disposal allows the Company to offer new solutions (MedSafe and TakeAway Medication Recovery System envelopes) that meet the regulations for ultimate user controlled substances disposal (Schedules II-V) to retail pharmacies. Additionally, with the new regulations, the Company is able to provide

7

the MedSafe and TakeAway Medication Recovery Systems to assisted living and hospice to address a long-standing issue within long-term care.

• | Local, state and federal agencies have growing needs for solutions to manage medical and pharmaceutical waste — the Company’s Sharps Recovery System is ideal for as-needed disposal of sharps and other small quantities of medical waste generated within government buildings, schools and communities. The Company also provides TakeAway Medication Recovery System envelopes and MedSafe solutions to government agencies in need of proper and regulatory compliant medication disposal. The federal government, state agencies and non-profits are recognizing the need to fund programs that address prevention as it pertains to the opioid crisis. MedSafe and mailback envelopes for proper medication disposal are being funded for prevention programs.


• | With an increased number of self-injectable medication treatments and local regulations, the Company believes its flagship product, the Sharps Recovery System, continues to offer the best option for proper sharps disposal at an affordable price. The Company delivers comprehensive services to pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell high-dollar, self-injectable medications, which include data management, compliance reporting, fulfillment, proper containment with disposal, branding and conformity with applicable regulations. In addition, the Company provides self-injectors with online and retail purchase options of sharps mailback systems, such as the Sharp Recovery System and Complete Needle Collection & Disposal System, respectively.


• | A heightened interest by many commercial companies who are looking to improve workplace safety with proper sharps disposal and unused medication disposal solutions — the Company offers a variety of services to meet these needs, including the Sharps Secure Needle Disposal System, Sharps Recovery System, Spill Kits and TakeAway Medication Recovery System envelopes.


• | The Company continually develops new solution offerings such as ultimate user medication disposal (MedSafe and TakeAway Medication Recovery System), mailback services for DEA registrant expired inventory of controlled substances (TakeAway Medication Recovery System DEA Reverse Distribution for Registrants) and shipback services for collection and recycling of single-use medical devices from surgical centers and other healthcare facilities (TakeAway Recycle System).

COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
We believe our competitive strengths include the following:

Vertically-integrated full-service operations.
Our operations are fully integrated, including manufacturing, assembly, distribution, treatment, online tracking and customer reporting. We have manufacturing, assembly, distribution and warehousing operations located in Houston, Texas. We own and operate a fully-permitted treatment facility in Carthage, Texas that incorporates our processing and treatment operations. The Carthage facility offers both steam sterilization, autoclave and high heat incineration for the proper treatment of regulated medical waste and non-hazardous pharmaceuticals. The autoclave system is utilized alongside the incinerator for day-to-day operations. We believe that our Texas facility is one of only ten permitted commercial facilities in the United States capable of treating all types of medical waste and pharmaceuticals (i.e., both incineration and autoclave capabilities). The Carthage location also serves as the Company's main facility for managing our recycling solution. In August 2016, the Company received the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Waste Management permit for the processing of medical waste at its treatment facility located in northeastern Pennsylvania. The 40,000 square foot facility has been permitted as both a medical waste treatment facility, using an autoclave, and as a transfer station for medical, pharmaceutical and trace chemotherapy waste of up to 82 tons per day. The facility is designed to cost-effectively and efficiently process medical waste generated by the Company’s route-based and mailback customers and doubles as a distribution center of mailback solutions and has been in operation since November 2016. The Company’s route-based pickup service business covers over 50% of the U.S. population in areas throughout the South, Southeast and Northeast. We track the movement of each shipment from outbound shipping to ultimate treatment and provide confirmation to the customer for their records using our proprietary SharpsTracer tracking and documentation system. We also track treatment volumes associated with pickup services provided as part of our blended product portfolio using SharpsTracer. We also provide customized reporting and comprehensive regulatory support for many of our customers. By controlling all aspects of the process internally, the Company is able to provide a one-stop solution and simplify the tracking and record-keeping processes to meet regulatory requirements for our customers. We believe the fully-integrated nature of our operations is a key factor and differentiator leading to our success and leadership position in our industry.
Highly scalable business model.
Because of our business model, we can add new business while leveraging our existing infrastructure. Our facilities can accommodate significant additional volume, incurring only variable costs of transportation and processing. Once we gain a new customer, our profitability typically increases as our customer base grows with minimal additional overhead expense due to the embedded nature of our products and the ease with which we can accommodate additional volume.
Diverse product markets.
Sharps offers services and products to a wide variety of end markets. The Company’s growth strategies are focused on our key markets which include professional offices (ambulatory surgical centers, physician groups, dentists and veterinarians), assisted living and long-term care facilities, government agencies, home healthcare, retail clinics and immunizing pharmacies. Additionally, our mailback solutions are positioned to manage waste generated in the home setting such as sharps, lancets and ultimate-user medications which generates business relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other markets to provide safe and proper disposal.

Our billings by market for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are below (as expressed in percentages of revenues):

 | Year Ended June 30,
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
BILLINGS BY MARKET*: | | | | | 
Professional | 34 | % | | 33 | % | 31 | %
Retail | 26 | % | | 20 | % | 19 | %
Home Health Care | 17 | % | | 20 | % | 21 | %
Pharmaceutical Manufacturer | 9 | % | | 11 | % | 16 | %
Assisted Living | 6 | % | | 7 | % | 6 | %

Environmental | 1 | % | | 2 | % | 1 | %
Other | 2 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

*Customer billings, a non-GAAP measure, includes all invoiced amounts for products shipped during the period reported. GAAP revenue includes customer billings as well as numerous adjustments necessary to reflect, (i) the deferral of a portion of current period sales, (ii) recognition of certain revenue associated with product returned for treatment and destruction and (iii) provisions for certain rebates, product returns, and discounts to customers which are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded. Most of the difference between customer billings and GAAP revenue is reflected in the Company's balance sheet as contract liability. See Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”. The Company believes this information about customer billings is useful to investors and other interested parties.
Increased state and federal regulatory attention.
To protect citizens and waste workers from needle stick injuries, ten states have passed state-wide legislation or regulations making it illegal to discard used sharps into household trash. Numerous cities, such as Seattle, have passed ordinances making household sharps disposal illegal. Almost all other states, as well as the District of Columbia and territories have passed strict guidelines regarding home sharps disposal. Whether legislation or strict guidelines, most of the U.S. population is required or strongly encouraged to not place used sharps in the household trash. In addition, certain states and counties have passed ordinances requiring businesses such as hospitals and those that sell syringes to the public, such as retail pharmacies and veterinary clinics, to take back syringes, once used, in regulatory-compliant sharps containers at no charge to the consumer.
In order to reduce accidental poisonings and pollution of our water and municipal water systems, twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have introduced legislation over the last few years intended to manage the disposal of consumer unused medications. Seven states and the District of Columbia have successfully passed such legislation. Passed or pending legislation related to disposal of consumer medications covers about two-thirds of the U.S. population. Further, since 2009, the federal government, nine states and several counties have introduced legislation requiring manufacturer responsibility for consumer generated unused medications and in some cases home sharps disposal. State regulatory agencies are also addressing this issue, including multiple states which now require healthcare providers to avoid sewer and trash disposal of non-hazardous unused medications within their facilities. States such as California, Washington and Minnesota have required assessment and proper treatment by a medical waste disposal company for years. However, other states such as Colorado and Florida are now requiring even small healthcare providers to segregate unused medications for proper disposal. In 2010, Congress passed the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act, leading to DEA changes to the Controlled Substances Act in 2014, allowing certain DEA registrants to collect controlled substances from the public. Collection receptacles can now be found in retail pharmacies, long-term care facilities and hospitals throughout the country. 
The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has recently passed regulations that will affect the healthcare industry including the Generator Improvement Rule passed in November 2016 and the Management Standards for Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals passed in February 2019 (the “Pharmaceutical Rule”). The Pharmaceutical Rule mandates that healthcare facilities compliantly manage the hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are generated on their sites and prohibits the “sewering” of any hazardous waste pharmaceutical by healthcare facilities beginning August 2019. As state adoption of these federal regulations occurs over the next 24 months and enforcement of these statutes increases, more companies could turn to solutions such as ours to help manage their hazardous waste and provide needed regulatory compliance. We believe we are well positioned to benefit given our strict adherence to established standards and extensive documentation and records.

Environmentally-conscious solution provider.
In addition to providing cost-effective solutions for our customers, the Company is committed to discovering new sustainable initiatives that mitigate the effects of potentially hazardous waste on the environment. Our patented Waste Conversion Process ™ repurposes regulated medical waste and unused medications into new resources used in industrial applications, such as the generation of electricity or recycled plastics used in the industrial sector. Our TakeAway Recycle System is a solution for the collection and recycling of single-use medical devices from surgical centers and other healthcare facilities. The system consists of containers designed for use in operating rooms or sterile processing departments. The containers are placed in a pre-paid return box for shipping to our treatment facilities where devices are stripped to their basic components and sent to appropriate recycling facilities. The system adds a much-needed solution to the market in which many single-use devices are reprocessed or disposed of as regulated medical waste, resulting in wastes that could be recycled. Our Universal Waste Shipback Program recycles the materials in light bulbs, batteries and other mercury-containing devices for use in new applications. In addition, the use of recycled paper and plastic materials for many of our products further demonstrates our total commitment to environmentally sound business practices. As an organization, the Company is a leading proponent for the development of solutions for the safe disposal of sharps, unused medications (including controlled substances), light bulbs, batteries and other mercury-containing devices in the community and continually works to raise public awareness of the issue.
Experienced and accomplished management team.
Our senior management team has extensive industry experience and is committed to the continued growth and success of our company. Mr. David P. Tusa, CEO and President, in addition to his ten-plus years with the Company has over 20 years of business and public company experience in multiple industries and in companies with revenues up to $500 million. Ms. Diana P. Diaz, CPA, MBA, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has over 25 years of finance, accounting, healthcare and public company industry experience. Mr. Gregory C. Davis, Vice President of Operations, has over 20 years of information technology and operations-related experience. Mr. Dennis Halligan, Vice President of Marketing, has broad marketing experience with the Company and at a variety of firms, including Stir Creative and R.J. Reynolds.
GROWTH STRATEGIES
We plan to grow our business by employing the following primary growth strategies:
Develop new products and services.
We continue to develop new solution offerings including ultimate-user medication disposal (MedSafe and TakeAway Medication Recovery System), mailback services for DEA registrant expired inventory of controlled substances (TakeAway Medication Recovery System DEA Reverse Distribution for Registrants) and shipback services for the collection and recycling of single-use devices (TakeAway Recycle System). These innovative product and service offerings allow us to gain further sales from existing customers as well as gain new customers who have a need for more comprehensive products.  We will continue our efforts to develop new solution offerings designed to facilitate the proper and cost effective management of medical waste, pharmaceutical waste, hazardous waste and ultimate-user medication disposals to better serve our customers and the environment. Additionally, we will continue to seek out and identify prospective new customers and markets for new solutions designed to meet the needs of these new customer segments.
Further penetrate existing customers and markets.
The addition of direct-service hazardous waste capabilities to our existing route-based regulated medical waste customers adds a viable cross-selling opportunity for the Company. While we offer hazardous waste services nationwide, the ability to directly service increases operational efficiencies and provides a better priced solution for the customer. In addition to hazardous waste services, the Company has multiple pharmaceutical waste solutions for cross-selling within the existing customer base including DEA-registrant disposal, non-controlled medication disposal and RCRA pharmaceutical disposal. The Company is a single-service provider for multiple healthcare-related waste generated in small to mid-size generators.
A new market for the Company is recycling of single-use devices. The interest from healthcare institutions in safer and more sustainable offerings has generated a full line of single-use devices and a tendency towards recycling at end of life rather than disposal in landfills. The opportunity to provide a recycling solution to surgical operatories that use these single-use devices offers the Company an exciting and sustainable solution in a new market. Further, we are able to develop solutions specific for single-use device manufacturers, building new relationships with manufacturers looking for a key marketing differentiator.

Many of our customers who currently use the Sharps Recovery System and TakeAway Recovery System could also benefit from the TakeAway Medication Recovery System, Medsafe, our hazardous waste solutions, our universal waste solutions or other specialized products. Although currently focused primarily on the proper management of medical and pharmaceutical wastes generated by medical professionals, pharmacies (including chains and mail order), assisted living facilities and other related organizations will develop needs for our other product lines as they expand their patient service offerings. As an entrenched and value-added supplier of treatment solutions, we believe the Company has the ability to capture incremental business from our existing customers.
The Company’s Pharmaceutical Manufacturer billings have grown from $0.3 million to $4.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2011 and 2019, respectively. We continue to see increased interest in our patient support program solution among pharmaceutical manufacturers as it relates to self-injectable medications especially related to new drug launches. We believe manufacturers are now, more than ever, focused on (i) product differentiation, (ii) improved interaction with patients and (iii) creating a touch point for individual patient follow-up that could lead to improved therapy outcomes. The patient support programs include the direct fulfillment of the Sharps Recovery System to the pharmaceutical manufacturers’ program participants, which provides the proper containment, return and treatment of the needles or injection devices utilized in therapy. Sharps’ proprietary SharpsTracer system tracks the return of the Sharps Recovery System by the patient to the treatment facility and then makes available to the pharmaceutical manufacturer electronic data. This data assists them in monitoring medication discipline and provides them with a touch point for individual patient follow-up, which potentially could lead to better outcomes. We believe the Company is a leader in providing solutions of this type to this market.
We are positive about anticipated growth opportunities in the Retail market. According to the CDC, 44.9% of U.S. adults received a flu shot and 32.2% of flu shots for adults were administered in a retail clinic in 2018. Over the flu seasons from 2011 to 2019, the Company saw growth in six years of 10% to 36%, including a 30% increase in 2019, and declines in three years of 13% to 17%. Despite the volatility, Sharps believes the Retail market should continue to contribute to long-term growth for the Company as consumers increasingly use alternative sites, such as retail pharmacies, to obtain flu and other immunizations.
Active Acquisition Program
Over the past five years, the Company has developed a network of medical and hazardous waste service providers including those with route-based pickup services, which allows the Company to serve the entire U.S. medical and hazardous waste market. The Company has acquired three route-based pickup service companies in the Northeast from July 2015 to July 2016. To improve operational efficiencies, the Company has opened offices and transfer stations in strategic locations. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth, the Company now offers route-based pickup services in a twenty-four (24) state region of the South, Southeast and Northeast portions of the United States. The Company directly serves more than 12,900 customer locations with route-based pickup services offered to areas encompassing over 55% of the U.S. population. 
With the addition of these route-based pickup regions and the network of medical and hazardous waste service providers serving the entire U.S., the Company offers clients a blended product portfolio to effectively target current and prospective customers with multi-site and multi-sized locations including those that generate larger quantities of medical and hazardous waste. The offering includes a single point of contact, consolidated billing, regulatory support and complete integration of our SharpsTracer system. The Company believes the comprehensive offering will continue to assist the Company in obtaining larger opportunities whereby the customer has both larger and smaller facilities generating medical waste, used healthcare materials and hazardous waste resulting in a more consistent and predictable revenue base for the Company.
Improve product and service awareness to attract new customers.
As we grow, we continue to focus marketing and sales efforts designed to educate professional offices, retail pharmacies and clinics, assisted living and long-term care facilities, home healthcare, government, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other commercial organizations on the benefits of our solutions and the need for safe, cost-effective and environmentally-friendly methods of medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous waste treatment. We believe that the full-service nature of our offerings and the ease and convenience of our mail- and ship-back delivery system will attract new customers who are not yet aware of the services we provide. We believe future growth will be driven by the need for our customers to properly document and track the disposal of their waste to maintain compliance with new and existing legislation. We believe our understanding of the legislative process and focus on accurate and thorough electronic tracking of waste disposal or treatment will provide substantial benefits to new customers looking to comply with new standards and promote environmentally cleaner business practices.
Enhance sales and marketing efforts.

Over the past five years, the Company has made ongoing investments in sales and marketing initiatives to drive growth in two areas:

• | Web and Inside Sales – Through targeted telemarketing initiatives (inside sales), e-commerce driven website and web-based promotional activities, we believe we can drive significant additional growth as we increase awareness of the Company’s innovative solution offerings with a focus on individual or small group professional offices, government agencies, smaller retail pharmacies and clinics and assisted living/long-term care facilities.


• | Field Sales – The field sales team focuses on larger dollar and nationwide opportunities in most of the markets served. The field sales team is able to address larger opportunities where we can integrate the route-based pickup service along with our mailback solutions to create a comprehensive waste management offering.

We have seen success with this approach over the past few years and believe the comprehensive offering capabilities will continue to accelerate revenue growth of the Company.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND SUPPLIERS
There is an inherent concentration of credit risk associated with accounts receivable arising from sales to our major customers. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, two customers represented approximately 27% of revenue. One of these customer also represented approximately 19%, or $1.7 million of the total accounts receivable balance at June 30, 2019. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, one customer represented approximately 17% of revenue and 13%, or $0.8 million, of the total accounts receivable balance at June 30, 2018. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, one customer represented approximately 17% of revenue. We may be adversely affected by our dependence on a limited number of high volume customers. Management believes that the risks are mitigated by (i) the contractual relationships with key customers, (ii) the high quality and reputation of the Company and its solution offerings and (iii) the continued diversification of our solution offerings into additional markets outside of our traditional customer base.
We currently transport (from the patient or user to the Company’s facility or subcontracted treatment facilities) the majority of our solution offerings using USPS; therefore, any long-term interruption in USPS delivery services would disrupt the return transportation and treatment element of our business. Postal delivery interruptions are rare. Additionally, since USPS employees are federal employees, such employees may be prohibited from engaging in or continuing a postal work stoppage, although there can be no assurance that such work stoppage can be avoided. We also have an arrangement with UPS whereby UPS transports certain other solution offerings. The ability to ship items, whether through the USPS or UPS, is regulated by the government and related agencies. Any change in regulation restricting the shipping of medical waste, used healthcare materials or unused or expired dispensed pharmaceuticals through these channels would be detrimental to our ability to conduct operations.
We maintain relationships with multiple raw materials suppliers and vendors in order to meet customer demands and assure availability of our products and solutions. With respect to the Sharps Recovery System solutions, we own proprietary molds and dies and utilize several contract manufacturers for the production of the primary raw materials. We believe that alternative suitable contract manufacturers are readily available to meet the production specifications of our products and solutions. We utilize national suppliers for the majority of the raw materials used in our other products and solutions and international suppliers for Pitch-It IV Poles.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We have a portfolio of trademarks and patents, both granted and pending. We consider our trademarks important in the marketing of our products and services, including the Sharps logo, Sharps Recovery System, TakeAway Medication Recovery System, MedSafe, SharpsTracer, Sharps Secure, TakeAway Environmental Return System, Complete Needle and PELLA-DRX™ among others. With respect to our registered marks, we continue using such marks and will file all necessary documentation to maintain their registrations for the foreseeable future. We have a number of patents issued over the period from June 1998 to December 2018, including those applicable to some of the unique design features of our MedSafe solution (patent number US 10,150,613), our PELLA-DRX waste conversion process (patent numbers US 8,163,045, US 8,100,989, US 8,268,073 and US 4,440,534), our Sharps Secure Needle Disposal System (patent numbers US 8,162,139 and US 8,235,883), our unique design features related to the TakeAway Environmental Return System drop-off boxes (patent number US 8,324,443) and our Complete Needle Collection & Disposal System (patent number US 4,463,106). We have patents pending on our MWMS rapid deployment system and additional features of our MedSafe solution.

Solely for convenience, the trademarks and service marks referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may appear without the ® or ™, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert to the fullest extent under applicable law our rights to such trademarks and service marks.
COMPETITION
There are several competitors who offer similar or identical products and services that facilitate the disposal of smaller quantities of medical waste. There are also a number of companies that focus specifically on the marketing of products and services which facilitate disposal through transport by the USPS (similar to the Company’s products). These companies include (i) smaller private companies or (ii) divisions of larger companies. Additionally, we compete in certain markets with Stericycle, the largest medical waste company in the country, which focuses primarily on a pickup service business model. With the addition of the route-based pickup services offered on a direct basis covering over 55% of the U.S. population throughout the South, Southeast and Northeast and through a network of medical and hazardous waste services providers, the Company believes it is well positioned with its comprehensive medical waste management offering to compete with Stericycle. As Sharps continues to grow and increase awareness of the proper disposal of syringes and unused medications (including controlled substances), it could face additional and possibly significant competition. We believe our comprehensive line of proven solution offerings, comprehensive medical waste management service offerings, first mover advantages, excellent industry reputation, significant history of market and customer success, quality solutions and products, as well as our capabilities as a vertically-integrated producer of products and services provide significant differentiation in the current competitive market.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Sharps is subject to extensive federal, state and/or local laws, rules and regulations. We are required to obtain permits, authorizations, approvals, certificates and other types of governmental permission from the EPA, the Department of Transportation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the State of Texas, the State of Pennsylvania and local governments with respect to our facilities and operations. Such laws, rules and regulations have been established to promote occupational safety and health standards and certain standards have been established in connection with the handling, transportation and disposal of certain types of medical and solid wastes, including transported medical waste. Our estimated annual costs of complying with these laws, regulations and guidelines, including environmental laws, is currently less than $200,000 per year. In the event additional laws, rules or regulations are adopted which affect our business, additional expenditures may be required in order for Sharps to be in compliance with such changing laws, rules and regulations.
