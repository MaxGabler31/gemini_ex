Overview 
 We are a commercial drug delivery company committed to improving the quality of life for patients with ear, nose and throat conditions. Our U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved products are steroid releasing implants designed to treat adult patients suffering from chronic sinusitis, who are managed by ENT physicians. These products include our PROPEL® family of products (PROPEL®, PROPEL® Mini and PROPEL® Contour) and the SINUVA® (mometasone furoate) Sinus Implant. The PROPEL family of products are used in conjunction with sinus surgery primarily in hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers and SINUVA is designed to be used in the physicians office setting of care to treat adult patients who have had ethmoid sinus surgery yet suffer from recurrent sinus obstruction due to polyps. The PROPEL family of products are devices approved under a Premarket Approval, or PMA and SINUVA is a drug that was approved under a New Drug Application, or NDA. 
 Our PROPEL family of steroid releasing implants are clinically proven to improve outcomes for chronic sinusitis patients following sinus surgery. PROPEL implants mechanically prop open the sinuses and release mometasone furoate, an advanced corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory properties, directly into the sinus lining, and then dissolve. PROPELs safety and effectiveness is supported by Level 1-A clinical evidence from multiple clinical trials, which demonstrates that PROPEL implants reduce inflammation and scarring after surgery, thereby reducing the need for postoperative oral steroids and repeat surgical interventions. More than 280,000 patients have been treated with PROPEL products to-date.
 | PROPEL clinical outcomes have been reported in a meta-analysis of prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies to improve surgical outcomes, demonstrating a 35% relative reduction in the need for postoperative interventions compared to surgery alone. A physician may treat a patient with PROPEL by inserting it into the ethmoid sinuses. PROPEL is a self-expanding implant designed to conform to and hold open the surgically enlarged sinus while gradually

releasing an anti-inflammatory steroid over a period of approximately 30 days and is absorbed into the body over a period of approximately six weeks.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | PROPEL Mini has also been shown by our clinical studies to reduce the need for postoperative interventions, including a 38% relative reduction in the need for postoperative interventions in the frontal sinus, compared to surgery alone with standard postoperative care. PROPEL Mini is a smaller version of PROPEL and is approved for use in both the ethmoid and frontal sinuses. PROPEL Mini is preferentially used by physicians compared with PROPEL when treating smaller anatomies or following less extensive procedures.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | PROPEL Contour is designed to facilitate treatment of the frontal and maxillary sinus ostia, or openings, of the dependent sinuses in procedures performed in both the operating room and in the office setting of care. PROPEL Contours lower profile, hourglass shape and malleable delivery system are designed for use in the narrow and difficult to access sinus ostia. In PROPEL Contours pivotal clinical study, the product demonstrated a 65% relative reduction in the need for postoperative interventions in the frontal sinus ostia compared to surgery alone with standard postoperative care.

 SINUVA, when placed during a routine physician office visit, expands into the sinus cavity and delivers an anti-inflammatory steroid directly to the site of polyp disease for 90 days. We have studied SINUVA in 4 clinical trials in over 400 patients to-date. Results from the pivotal RESOLVE II randomized clinical trial demonstrated a 74% relative reduction in bilateral polyp grade (a measurement of the extent of ethmoid polyp disease) and a 30% relative reduction in nasal obstruction and congestion for patients treated with SINUVA compared to a control group treated with a sham procedure, receiving no implant. Patients in both arms of the study were required to use an intranasal steroid spray daily. In addition, the study demonstrated a 61% reduction in the proportion of patients indicated for revision surgery at day 90. To supplement clinical trials performed with SINUVA to-date, in which one course of SINUVA treatment was evaluated, we commenced the ENCORE study in November 2017. ENCORE was a 50-patient multicenter, open-label study focused on evaluation of the safety of repeat placement of SINUVA in a population of chronic sinusitis patients with nasal polyps. Study findings showed zero serious adverse events related to the implants during the measurement period and zero serious adverse events related to repeat placement. 
 Our PROPEL family of products are used almost exclusively in the operating room of a hospital or ambulatory surgery center. These providers receive a facility fee for the sinus surgery procedure which is intended to pay for supplies used in this procedure, including the PROPEL family of products. Reimbursement submissions to cover the cost of SINUVA may be reported to payors using the unassigned Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, or HCPCS, code J3490. We applied to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, for a product-specific J code for SINUVA in the 2018 process but this code was not granted. We have submitted a new application seeking a product-specific J code in the 2019 process. 
 We continue to invest in research and development of new products and product improvements. We commenced a clinical trial in December 2018 of a new pipeline product, the investigational ASCEND drug-coated sinus balloon. The ASCEND study is a prospective, randomized, blinded, multi-center trial of 70 patients that will assess the safety and efficacy of our ASCEND product. The ASCEND product will be randomized against an uncoated balloon and, similar to clinical studies for our PROPEL family of products, the primary endpoint will be evaluated at 30 days. This study will assess the ASCEND products ability to improve patency rates, as well as a number of other endoscopic parameters. If successful, we expect that ASCEND would be submitted to the FDA under the PMA pathway for potential approval. We believe that the ASCEND drug-coated balloon would be complementary to our current commercial products. 
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, approximately 12% of the U.S. adult population, or 29 million people, are affected by chronic sinusitis, making it more prevalent than heart disease and asthma. Chronic sinusitis is an inflammatory condition in which the sinus lining becomes swollen and inflamed, leading to significant patient morbidity. Chronic sinusitis significantly impacts the quality of life of 
 
2 


  patients, including difficulty breathing, chronic headaches, recurrent infections, bodily pain and loss of sense of smell and taste. These persistent symptoms can severely impact a patients day-to-day well-being, resulting in frequent doctor visits and lost work productivity and can lead to chronic fatigue and depression. Chronic sinusitis is managed by a combination of medical management and surgical intervention. The first line of therapy is medical management involving antibiotics, anti-inflammatory steroids and decongestants. Sinusitis is the most common reason for adult outpatient antibiotic use in the United States, comprising 11% of all antibiotic prescriptions. Patients whose symptoms persist despite medical management are recommended to undergo functional endoscopic sinus surgery, or FESS. FESS is performed in the operating room to open the blocked sinus pathways by removing and/or displacing inflamed tissue and bone using surgical tools. Although sinus surgery can be effective, a majority of patients experience recurrent symptoms which commonly necessitate additional treatment with medications and surgery. 
 We estimate that there are more than 3.5 million people with chronic sinusitis who are managed by ENT physicians in the United States each year, many of whom we believe could benefit from products that incorporate our drug releasing bioabsorbable implant technology. The target market for our PROPEL family of products includes approximately 540,000 patients who undergo FESS for chronic sinusitis each year in the United States, with about 85% of those patients receiving treatment of the ethmoid sinus, approximately 30% receiving treatment of the frontal sinus and approximately 85% receiving treatment of the maxillary sinus, and with most patients receiving treatment for multiple sinuses. PROPEL Contour may also expand the availability of local steroid delivery in the office setting such as with sinus balloon dilation procedures, of which there are approximately 50,000 performed per year today. Long term, we believe that PROPEL Contour may provide a treatment option for the approximately 800,000 patients that are seen by an otolaryngologist each year for chronic sinusitis symptoms but choose not to undergo a surgical procedure. Our target market for SINUVA includes approximately 635,000 patients who have previously undergone FESS but continue to suffer with nasal polyps. 
 While our primary commercial focus is the U.S. market, both PROPEL and PROPEL Mini received CE Markings, permitting them to be marketed in Europe. We have initiated efforts intended to support future expansion into international geographies. Approximately 450,000 and 250,000 FESS procedures are performed annually in the Asia Pacific and European regions, respectively. Our commercialization strategy will consider several factors including regulatory requirements, reimbursement coverage for our products, and key opinion leader support. Our initial focus is on Germany, where we are working to build broad reimbursement, and Japan, where we are working through the regulatory process. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we estimate that approximately 2,900 accounts have stocked our PROPEL family of products for use by ENT physicians. Based on the number of units shipped as of December 31, 2018, we estimate that physicians have treated over 280,000 patients with our PROPEL family of products. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we generated revenue of $108.5 million, $96.3 million and $78.7 million, respectively, and incurred a net loss of $22.9 million, $16.4 million and $25.2 million, for each respective year. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $187.8 million. 
 We are continuing to grow and develop our sales force in order to expand our communication of the benefits of our commercial products to our physician customers. We seek to grow our revenue by increasing the frequency of use of our products among current physician customers and by adding new physician users. 
 Overview of Sinusitis 
 The sinuses are a system of connected air-filled cavities located within the bones around the nose and eyes that allow for natural ventilation and drainage of mucus. There are four sinus cavities: ethmoid, frontal, maxillary and sphenoid. One of each type of sinus lies on either side of the face. The sinuses are lined with soft, pink tissue called mucosa, which serves to constantly cleanse the sinuses of impurities such as dust, dirt, allergens, pollutants

  and bacteria. To clear these inhaled pathogens, the sinus lining secretes mucus which is then cleared away by small, hair-like structures called cilia, which act in coordination to sweep the mucus through the sinus pathways and out through the back of the throat. 
 

The ethmoid sinuses, which lie between the eyes, are a series of small cells with multiple, often interconnected openings in a honeycomb-like formation. These sinuses serve as the central aeration and drainage pathway for all other sinuses. The frontal, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses are known as dependent sinuses, as they each consist of one large cell that drains through an opening, or ostium, into the ethmoid sinus. 
 Chronic sinusitis is an inflammatory condition in which the sinus lining becomes swollen and inflamed, leading to significant patient morbidity including difficulty breathing, chronic headaches, recurrent infections, bodily pain and loss of sense of smell and taste. These persistent symptoms can severely impact a patients day-to-day well-being, resulting in frequent doctor visits and can lead to chronic fatigue and depression. The condition significantly reduces work productivity from absenteeism and reduced on-the-job effectiveness, especially meaningful given the average chronic sinusitis patient age of approximately 37 years.

 The debilitating patient symptoms and quality of life impairments attributed to chronic sinusitis create a significant healthcare burden to patients, insurers and employers. 
 Current Treatments for Chronic Sinusitis and Their Limitations 
 The treatment of chronic sinusitis often entails a combination of medical management and surgical intervention to treat the underlying inflammation of the sinus lining, while addressing the secondary symptoms caused by obstruction of the natural drainage pathways. 
Medical Management 
 The first line of therapy for chronic sinusitis is medical management, which typically includes prescribed antibiotics, anti-inflammatory steroids and decongestants. Despite limited efficacy of use of antibiotics in this patient population and the consequence of increasing bacterial resistance, we believe there is pervasive overuse of these drugs, which could lead to patient resistance and has resulted in sinusitis being identified as a major target in national efforts to reduce unnecessary medical intervention. Sinusitis is the most common reason for adult outpatient antibiotic use in the United States, comprising 11% of all antibiotic prescriptions. In addition, physicians often prescribe decongestants and other drugs to target mucus accumulation. 
 Steroids are prescribed in two forms, oral steroid pills and nasal steroid sprays, both of which have serious limitations. Oral steroid therapy is effective at reaching the sinus lining, but it does so by means of systemic exposure and therefore carries the risk of serious side effects, including glaucoma, bone loss, weight gain, psychosis and difficulty in controlling blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes. Nasal steroid sprays, commonly indicated for rhinitis, or inflammation of the nasal passage, are routinely prescribed for chronic sinusitis patients. While nasal steroid sprays avoid systemic exposure and thus lack such serious side effects, an estimated 70% of the drug is swallowed and the remainder is directed to the nasal passages, instead of the sinuses, which limits efficacy. In a published study, the fraction of drug deposited in the sinuses from a nasal steroid spray was measured to be less than 2%. Poor patient compliance further limits the effectiveness of nasal steroid sprays. Although medical management can reduce symptoms, an estimated 20% or more of chronic sinusitis patients who receive medical therapy are unresponsive. 
 Of note, medical management is not only used as a first line of therapy for patients afflicted with primary chronic sinusitis, situations in which patients have not had sinus surgery, but also for patients who have recurrent symptoms despite having had sinus surgery. Patients in both stages of the condition are managed medically and hence are subject to the limitations described above. 
 Sinus Surgery 
 In cases where patients are symptomatic despite medical management, a physician may recommend FESS. In the FESS procedure, the physician enlarges the inflamed and obstructed sinus pathways by displacing and/or removing inflamed tissue and bone in order to facilitate normal sinus drainage and aeration. First introduced in the United States in the 1980s, FESS is considered the standard of care for surgical intervention to treat chronic sinusitis. During most procedures, the honeycomb-like cells of the ethmoid sinuses are removed, resulting in one large open cavity. ENTs may also enlarge the frontal and other sinuses by either surgically removing tissue or dilating the ostia, or opening, with a balloon. 
 FESS is typically performed under general anesthesia in an operating room. During the procedure, a physician inserts an endoscope into the nasal cavity to provide visualization of the patients anatomy. Surgical instruments, powered cutting tools and balloon dilation devices are used to remove or dilate obstructive tissue and bone. Following the surgical intervention, physicians often pack the newly opened ethmoid sinuses with gauze or other obstructive sinus packing materials to hold the sinus cavities open. A follow-up office visit may occur several days after the procedure, and an additional one or two follow-up visits typically occur over the first four to six weeks following surgery to monitor for and treat complications. 
 
5 


 While FESS is the standard of care for treating medically-refractory chronic sinusitis, it has several limitations: 
 

 | Limited effectiveness. Inflammation and scarring in the postoperative period are common and can compromise the surgical result by negatively impacting the ability of the sinuses to heal. This increases the need for continued medical management and additional surgical procedures. Within the first year after surgery, approximately 64% of patients experience recurrent symptoms.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Limited ability to address postoperative inflammation. While oral steroids prescribed postoperatively can be effective at addressing inflammation and scarring, the required doses are significant and can result in serious systemic side effects, including glaucoma, bone loss, weight gain and psychosis. Further, use of oral steroids is restricted in patients with diabetes, glaucoma and certain psychological disorders. As a result, we believe only 20% of physicians prescribe them routinely after surgery. The absence of effective anti-inflammatory steroid therapy leaves the surgical wound susceptible to postoperative complications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pain and discomfort during postoperative period. During surgery, an ENT physician typically places sinus packing materials into the ethmoid sinuses to physically separate tissues in an attempt to prevent scarring and adhesions. Following surgery, physicians see patients two to three times in order to monitor for and, if necessary, to treat complications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potential for revision surgery. Within the first year after FESS, approximately 10% of patients will return to the operating room to undergo a revision procedure, while additional patients will return for a revision procedure after one year. We believe the risk of potential revision surgery is a significant deterrent to some patients that would otherwise undergo FESS for chronic sinusitis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Trend for treatment in the physicians office setting of care 
 Multiple technological advances, including balloon sinus dilation devices, have expanded the treatable chronic sinusitis patient population. Sinus dilation is now utilized by physicians in their offices to treat patients with mild chronic sinusitis who may not be willing to undergo or are not candidates for sinus surgery performed under general anesthesia in the operating room setting. The ability to treat patients in the office with sinus dilation has spurred interest in the ENT physician community for additional products that facilitate treatment of patients in the office setting of care. 
 We believe that the limitations of medical management and lack of disease resolution after FESS lead to undertreatment of many chronic sinusitis patients. We estimate that only a third of patients recommended for sinus surgery proceed with the potentially beneficial procedure, which we believe is due to its limitations and high risk for additional medical management and surgical revision. While balloon dilation has been introduced to open frontal, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses, or dependent sinuses, in a less invasive manner, balloon dilation procedures are not designed to treat disease in the most commonly involved sinuses, the ethmoids, and this procedure does not address the underlying inflammation associated with chronic sinusitis. We believe an opportunity exists to reach these undertreated patients by providing a more effective option to address inflammatory disease, while improving the overall outcomes of FESS. 
 Our Solution 
 Our PROPEL family of products offers ENT physicians a choice of three distinct drug releasing bioabsorbable implants to best meet the needs of surgical patients. We launched SINUVA in March 2018 for use in the office setting of care to treat patients who have had prior ethmoid sinus surgery but have recurrent polyp disease and we continue to invest in ongoing research and development to develop additional new innovative solutions to further expand our ENT-focused business.

 Our Technology Platform 
 Our drug releasing bioabsorbable implant technology consists of a polymer-based implant that is coated with a drug and polymer matrix. In fabricating the implant, we use polymers that are bioabsorbable and, over time, gradually and fully absorb into the body. The polymers chosen are materials with established safety profiles and have been used in medical devices for over 30 years. 
 Our innovative design process enables us to develop the mechanical and drug delivery features independently, lending to our customization capability. Our highly specialized bioabsorbable polymer engineering capability enables us to design each product with different physical characteristics such as size, radial strength and other attributes for a tailored approach to treating various sinuses. Our implants are designed to be self-expanding, which facilitates insertion when compressed, and expand to conform to the surrounding anatomy after insertion. The ability to control radial strength is important in enabling us to address different diseases at different states. For example, in some instances an implant may be used to maintain an already open passageway. In other situations, an implant with significantly greater strength may mechanically dilate a diseased passageway. 
 Our expertise in drug delivery allows us to effectively pair appropriate polymer delivery matrices with desired therapeutic agents. This allows selection of a therapeutic agent based on its clinical effectiveness and tailoring of the platform accordingly. In the case of PROPEL, we considered the wide range of off-patent corticosteroids, chose the one best suited for treatment of sinus inflammation, then customized the polymer coating to achieve the desired drug delivery. Once a drug is selected, our specialized capability in drug formulation enables us to control the rate at which the drug elutes, allowing us to design implants from which the drug is released over a matter of weeks to even longer durations. As a result, we have the flexibility to select the type of drug to be used on the implant and then engineer the implant to control the amount of drug delivered over time. 
 Our Commercial Products 
 We currently market the PROPEL family of products, consisting of PROPEL, PROPEL Mini and PROPEL Contour. These products are indicated for use following sinus surgery, typically performed in the hospital out-patient or ambulatory surgery center setting of care. Our SINUVA product was approved by the FDA in December 2017 for the treatment of recurrent nasal polyp disease in patients 18 years or older who have had previous ethmoid sinus surgery. SINUVA provides a treatment for these patients designed to be administered in the physicians office setting of care. 
Improving Surgical Outcomes Managing Recurrent Disease

 The PROPEL Family 
 Our PROPEL family of steroid releasing implants are the first and only FDA-approved drug releasing sinus implants for chronic sinusitis sufferers 18 years or older. PROPEL is indicated for use following ethmoid sinus surgery, PROPEL Mini is indicated for use following ethmoid or frontal sinus surgery and PROPEL Contour is indicated for use following frontal or maxillary sinus surgery. Our PROPEL implants are designed to improve the outcomes of sinus surgery by holding open the sinus passageways, thereby reducing postoperative inflammation and scarring. These implants are inserted by a physician under endoscopic visualization following sinus surgery. Once inserted, the self-expanding implants conform to and hold open the surgically enlarged sinus, while gradually releasing an anti-inflammatory steroid, mometasone furoate, which is available generically, directly to the sinus lining over a period of approximately 30 days. The implants fully absorb into the body over a period of four to six weeks or are removed at the discretion of a physician during a routine office visit. Once absorbed or removed, the implant no longer provides structural support. 
 The graphic below illustrates the operation of PROPEL and PROPEL Mini in the ethmoid sinuses: 
 

We designed the steroid drug release of the PROPEL products to have a duration of approximately 30 days to match the postoperative healing cycle characterized in published medical literature. We selected mometasone furoate as the anti-inflammatory agent among numerous evaluated compounds based on three important characteristics: absorbability, binding affinity and low systemic bioavailability. The compound preferentially absorbs into the sinus lining instead of the surrounding mucous fluid. The drug has the highest glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity, making it highly potent in preventing inflammation once within tissue. Glucocorticoid receptors are the molecules in the surface membranes of cells throughout the body to which corticosteroids chemically bind. Additionally, the compound has low systemic bioavailability, meaning that it has negligible systemic safety side effects. 
 We believe the principal benefits of our PROPEL family of steroid releasing implants include: 
 

 | Improved surgical outcomes. Our implants have been clinically proven to improve FESS results by reducing postoperative inflammation and scarring. In a meta-analysis of prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies, our PROPEL implants placed following ethmoid sinus surgery provided a 46% relative reduction in inflammation and a 70% relative reduction in scarring compared to the control implant. Postoperative complications, such as inflammation and polyps as well as scarring or adhesions, are common reasons for FESS failure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Targeted steroid therapy to address postoperative inflammation. Our implants are the first and only FDA approved drug releasing bioabsorbable implants. They deliver an anti-inflammatory steroid postoperatively directly to the sinus lining in a controlled fashion over a period of approximately 30 days, which helps in the wound healing process. In a meta-analysis of prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies, our PROPEL implants placed following ethmoid sinus surgery reduced the need for oral steroids by 40% compared to the control implant.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Improved healing without obstruction. Our implants improve postoperative care. Once inserted, the self-expanding implants are designed to conform to and hold open the surgically enlarged ethmoid sinuses until fully absorbed into the body, which improves wound healing without obstructing the sinuses and causing congestion. Our steroid releasing implants are designed to obviate the need for sinus packing materials, which can be a significant source of postoperative pain and discomfort. Our implants significantly reduce scarring and adhesions, which reduces the potential for pain in postoperative treatments.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Reduced need for postoperative surgical interventions. In clinical studies, our implants demonstrated a significant reduction in the need for postoperative surgical intervention. In a meta-analysis of prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies of over 200 patients, PROPEL provided a 35% relative reduction in the need for postoperative oral steroids and surgical intervention compared to the control implant when placed in the ethmoid sinus. In addition, the PROGRESS study, an 80-patient prospective, randomized, blinded, multicenter trial of PROPEL Contour, demonstrated a statistically significant 65% relative reduction in the need for postoperative interventions compared to surgery alone when PROPEL Contour was placed in the frontal sinus. We believe that patients who have been deterred by the high revision rates associated with FESS may now consider surgical intervention to treat their chronic sinusitis condition.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In February 2017, we received FDA approval for PROPEL Contour, a steroid releasing implant designed to facilitate treatment of the frontal and maxillary sinus ostia, or openings, of the dependent sinuses, which we believe represents an opportunity for adoption in a variety of settings for chronic sinusitis sufferers 18 years or older undergoing sinus surgery. In the operating room, PROPEL Contour has demonstrated the ability to expand adoption of steroid releasing implants overall by providing physicians with a range of products needed to customize treatment based on their patients disease and anatomy. In particular, we believe PROPEL Contour will be seen as the right fit for many of the 30% of sinus surgeries that involve the frontal sinuses today and the lower profile, malleable delivery system will increase usage particularly in those patients whose frontal sinuses are more challenging to access.

SINUVA 
 Following sinus surgery, the underlying chronic inflammation associated with chronic sinusitis can lead to recurrent obstruction of the sinus cavity over time, especially in patients afflicted with polyps, a sign of severe inflammation. Improving care of such chronic patients holds meaningful opportunity to significantly reduce healthcare costs by reducing the need for revision surgery. We have designed the SINUVA steroid releasing implant to be placed in the physician office setting following a routine visit as an alternative treatment option for patients who are candidates for revision surgery. The implant is based on the same drug releasing bioabsorbable implant technology as the PROPEL family of products but is designed to have greater radial strength in order to dilate an obstructed, polyp-filled sinus cavity, and deliver drug for an extended period of time. SINUVA was subject to regulation as a drug product and we received approval from the FDA to commercialize SINUVA in the 
 
9 


  U.S. under an NDA. We believe SINUVA could be an appealing alternative to patients who have previously undergone FESS but continue to suffer from polyp recurrence. 
 

SINUVA implant in delivery system and expanded

 Our family of drug releasing implants consists of polymers that control local drug release and provide structural support to adjacent tissues during the healing process. We believe the development, manufacturing and regulatory approval for products incorporating this technology requires capabilities in polymer science, drug delivery, analytical testing and combination products. These competencies allow our technical team to tailor drug formulation, polymer design, drug release duration, implant radial strength and degradation period to meet different clinical needs. We may apply these competencies to the development of new products over time. Such new products, or changes that we make in the therapeutic agent used in our products will require FDA approval prior to commercialization in the United States. 
 Pipeline 
 We remain committed to delivering solutions across the continuum of care for chronic sinusitis sufferers and continue to invest in research and development. We initiated enrollment in the ASCEND clinical study to assess a new platform product, a drug coated balloon, in December 2018. This product leverages our core competencies and proprietary technologies in both polymer science and drug delivery, and if successful, would provide local delivery of mometasone furoate at the time of dilation, improving sinus patency rates and reducing the need for adjunct steroid interventions. The ASCEND study is a 70-patient prospective, randomized, blinded, multi-center trial that will assess sinus patency and other endoscopic outcomes at multiple timepoints. 
 Clinical Trial Findings and In-Process Studies 
 PROPEL and PROPEL Mini 
 PROPEL Ethmoid Sinus Studies. The safety and efficacy of PROPEL in the ethmoid sinuses has been studied in three prospective, multicenter clinical trials conducted in the United States enrolling a total of 205 patients. The principal safety and efficacy information is derived from the ADVANCE II randomized clinical trial and is supported by the ADVANCE clinical trial and an initial pilot study. A meta-analysis that pooled data from the ADVANCE II study and the initial pilot study provides further evidence of efficacy. In all three studies, implants were placed following ethmoid sinus surgery, or ethmoidectomy, which entails removal of the honeycomb-like partitions between the ethmoid sinuses in order to create larger sinus cavities. 
 All three studies were designed to measure PROPELs ability to improve the outcomes of sinus surgery. This included measuring the need for postoperative interventions such as adhesion lysis, which is a procedure to separate scar tissue and adhesions within the sinus cavity, and the need to prescribe oral steroids to treat inflammation. The studies also measured the impact of PROPEL on other postoperative complications, such as occurrence of polyposis and middle turbinate lateralization. Prevention of these complications contributes to the long-term success of sinus surgery. Polyposis represents a higher level inflammatory disease. The middle turbinate is a bony structure in the middle of the sinus, responsible for filtration, heating, and humidification of nasal air flow. Middle turbinate lateralization is an undesired complication where this structure curves towards the outer, or lateral, wall of the nose resulting in blockage of the ethmoid sinus passage. 
 
10 


 In a meta-analysis, the two prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind studies enrolled a total of 143 patients utilizing an intra-patient control design. The results of these two trials, the ADVANCE II study and the initial Pilot study, were then pooled which represents the first and only Level 1a evidence for any devices used in sinus surgery today. Level 1a evidence is the highest level of evidence according to the criteria of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford. For evidence Level 1a, a meta-analysis of multiple randomized controlled trials is required. 
 Compared to the control implant, the drug releasing implant provided a 35% relative reduction in postoperative interventions, a 51% relative reduction in adhesion lysis and a 40% relative reduction in oral steroid intervention. The relative reduction in frank polyposis was 46%. Additional efficacy endpoints of significant, or severe, adhesions and middle turbinate lateralization, determined by clinical investigators at the study centers, were reduced by 70% (p=0.0013) and 75% (p=0.0225), respectively.

 PROPEL Mini Frontal Sinus Study. We have completed a prospective, randomized blinded multicenter clinical trial to support an expanded indication for placement of PROPEL Mini in the frontal sinuses called PROGRESS. Approximately 30% of patients undergoing sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis suffers from frontal sinus disease. We enrolled 80 patients in the study using an intra-patient control design to assess both safety and efficacy of PROPEL Mini when placed following surgery of the frontal sinus, compared to surgery alone. The primary efficacy endpoint is the reduction in need for postoperative interventions such as the need for surgical intervention or oral steroids. In August 2015, we announced preliminary topline data from the PROGRESS trial, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PROPEL Mini when placed in the frontal sinuses following surgery, showing that the study met its primary efficacy endpoint and demonstrating a statistically significant 38% relative reduction in the need for postoperative interventions compared to surgery alone. In March 2016, we received approval to expand the indication of PROPEL Mini to treat patients undergoing frontal sinus surgery. 
 PROPEL Contour 
 In February 2017, we received FDA approval for PROPEL Contour, a steroid releasing implant designed to facilitate treatment of the frontal and maxillary sinus ostia, or openings, of the dependent sinuses, which we believe represents opportunity for adoption in a variety of settings. In the operating room, PROPEL Contour has the potential to lead to expanded adoption of steroid releasing implants overall by providing physicians with a range of products needed to customize treatment based on their patients disease and anatomy. We believe PROPEL Contours lower profile, malleable delivery system will increase usage particularly in those patients whose frontal sinuses are more challenging to access. Since sinus surgeries typically involve treatment of one or more of the ethmoid, maxillary or frontal sinuses, we believe the PROPEL Contour greatly increases the chance that a PROPEL product will be used. We announced results of the second cohort of patients in the PROGRESS study in May 2016. This phase of the PROGRESS study was an 80-patient prospective randomized blinded multicenter trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of PROPEL Contour when placed in the frontal sinuses following sinus surgery. This study demonstrated a statistically significant 65% relative reduction in the need for post-operative interventions, such as the need for additional surgical procedures or need for oral steroid prescription, compared to surgery alone with standard post-operative care.

 SINUVA 
 In December 2017, we received FDA approval for SINUVA, a steroid releasing implant for the treatment of nasal polyposis in adult patients who have had ethmoid surgery. The SINUVA implant is intended to be placed in the physician office setting of care. This products primary mode of action is as a drug, and for this reason we were required to obtain an NDA approval from the FDA, rather than a PMA approval. In order to support the NDA application with the FDA, we completed four studies of SINUVA: a pilot study, a pharmacokinetic study, RESOLVE and RESOLVE II. In July 2016, we completed enrollment of the RESOLVE II pivotal trial, which was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, blinded study of 300 patients. Both co-primary endpoints were met, including improvement in patient-reported nasal obstruction/congestion score (p=0.0074) and reduction in bilateral polyp grade as evaluated by a panel of three sinus surgeons (p=0.0073). In addition, several pre-specified secondary endpoints were met, including the reduction in the proportion of patients still indicated for repeat sinus surgery, reduction in ethmoid obstruction and improvement in sense of smell. The RESOLVE study (n=100) included ocular exams, and patients were followed for six months to assess longer-term outcomes. Compared to the control group, the treatment group demonstrated greater reduction from baseline to day 90 in nasal congestion/obstruction score and bilateral polyp grade (judged by an independent panel), but these primary endpoint results did not reach statistical significance (p=0.1365 and 0.0985, respectively). According to clinical investigator grading, the treatment group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both bilateral polyp grade (p<0.02) and percent ethmoid sinus obstruction (p<0.0001) throughout the entire six-month study period. In a post-hoc analysis of nasal congestion/obstruction scores in a subset of 67 patients with at least grade 2 polyposis on each side at baseline, this outcome trended towards statistical significance in favor of the treatment group (p=0.0505). Longer-term, the study showed that at six months, control patients were at 3.6x higher risk of remaining indicated for revision surgery than treated patients. The findings from the RESOLVE study were used to inform the pivotal RESOLVE II study design. 
 In November 2017, we commenced the ENCORE study, a 50-patient multicenter, open-label study focused on evaluation of the safety of repeat placement of SINUVA in a population of chronic sinusitis patients with nasal polyps. Study findings showed zero serious adverse events related to the implants during the measurement period and zero serious adverse events related to repeat placement. 
 Seasonality 
 We expect revenue from our PROPEL family of products and SINUVA to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal variations in the volume of sinus surgery procedures performed, which has been impacted historically by factors including the status of patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles and the seasonal nature of allergies, which can impact sinus-related symptoms. 
Competition 
 Our industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. In addition, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies may also seek to provide treatment to chronic sinusitis patients that could compete with us. Many of the companies developing or marketing ENT products are publicly traded or are divisions of publicly-traded companies and may enjoy competitive advantages including: 

 | greater financial and human capital resources;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


 | established relationships with ENT physicians, referring physicians, customers and third-party payors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | established sales, marketing and worldwide distribution networks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 Because of the size of the market opportunity for the treatment of chronic sinusitis, potential competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to aggressively promote their products or develop new products. New product developments that could compete with us more effectively are possible because of the prevalence of chronic sinusitis and the extensive research efforts and technological progress that exist within the market. Large medical device companies with ENT divisions, such as Medtronic, also have capability in drug releasing stents. 
 Our commercially available products are designed to be used following sinus surgery. If another company successfully develops a surgical technique, drug, drug delivery system (including intranasal steroid sprays) or device that is more efficacious than our steroid releasing implant solution, sales of our products would be significantly and adversely affected. 
 One alternative to delivering steroids to the sinuses postoperatively with our PROPEL family of products and SINUVA, is the prescription of oral steroids. While oral steroids prescribed postoperatively can be effective at addressing inflammation and scarring, the required doses are significant and can result in serious systemic side effects, including glaucoma, bone loss, weight gain and psychosis. Further, oral steroids have restricted use in diabetic individuals, patients with glaucoma and some psychological disorders. We believe, as a result, only 20% of physicians prescribe them routinely after surgery. Additionally, there are commercially available packing materials and spacers on the market that provide a spacing function and are less expensive than our products. During surgery, approximately 60% of ENT physicians place sinus packing materials, either absorbable or non-absorbable, into the ethmoid sinuses to physically separate tissues in an attempt to prevent scarring and adhesions. Non-absorbable spacers are sometimes placed in the frontal sinuses to maintain patency. Following surgery, the sinus packing materials or spacers are removed by pulling or suctioning them from the newly opened cavity, a painful and time-consuming process, often necessitating pain medication. Despite the use of packing materials, scarring and adhesions are common, sometimes necessitating painful removal of additional tissue during postoperative treatments. Some physicians choose to soak packing materials with steroid in liquid form in an effort to deliver steroid to the sinus. This practice is off-label and is not supported by clinical data. However, although we believe our products have significant advantages over sinus packing materials, spacers and other treatment options, they are expensive relative to packing materials and may not be reimbursed by third-party payors. As a result, ENT physicians may choose to use oral steroid delivery or packing/spacing materials or a combination of the two, which are less expensive, in lieu of our products. 
 We believe that our continued ability to compete favorably depends on: 
 

 | successfully expanding our commercial operations;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | continuing to innovate and maintain scientifically-advanced technology;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | having reimbursement in place to support broad adoption of our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | developing technologies for applications in the sinuses and other areas of ENT;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | attracting and retaining skilled personnel;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | obtaining patents or other intellectual property protection for our products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | conducting clinical studies and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property 
 As of December 31, 2018, we owned 84 issued patents globally, of which 32 were issued U.S. patents, and we owned 24 pending patent applications globally, of which 8 were pending patent applications in the United States. Subject to payments of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges, our issued patents have expiration dates between 2020 and 2034, of which one will expire by the end of 2020, 18 will expire between 2021 and 2025, and the remaining 65 will expire after 2025. 
 
13 


 As of December 31, 2018, our trademark portfolio contains 53 trademark registrations, nine of which are U.S. trademark registrations, as well as 10 foreign pending trademark applications. 
 We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and may rely upon licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We manufacture our steroid releasing implants at our facility in Menlo Park, California with components supplied by external suppliers. We perform inspections of these components before use in our manufacturing operations. Using these components, we assemble, inspect, test and package our implants, and send them to a third-party sterilization vendor. After sterilization, we perform inspections of the finished implants internally and via third-party laboratories to determine compliance with our specifications, after which we place the implants into our inventory and ultimately ship the finished products to customers. 
 The active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and a number of our critical components used in our implants are supplied to us from single source suppliers. We rely on single source suppliers for some of our polymer materials, some extrusions and molded components and some off-the-shelf components. Our ability to commercially supply our products and to develop our product candidates depends, in part, on our ability to successfully obtain the API and polymer materials used in these products in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for commercialization and clinical testing. We have entered into manufacturing, supply or service agreements with a number of our single source suppliers pursuant to which they supply the API and components we need. We generally acquire our single source components pursuant to purchase orders placed in the ordinary course of business. However, we are not certain that our single source suppliers will be able to meet our demand for their products, whether because of the nature of our agreements with those suppliers, our limited experience with those suppliers or our relative importance as a customer to those suppliers. It may be difficult for us to assess their ability to timely meet our demand in the future. To date, we have not experienced any significant supply constraints or delays in procuring components and materials, and while our suppliers have generally met our demand for their products or services on a timely basis in the past, they may be unable or unwilling to meet our needs in the future. 
 We continue to improve our manufacturing capabilities and increasing capacity as we increase the extent of our commercialization efforts. We believe our manufacturing operations are in compliance with regulations mandated by the FDA. We are an FDA-registered medical device and drug manufacturer and we were granted PMA approval for PROPEL in August 2011. Our manufacturing facilities and processes are subject to periodic inspections and audits by various federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. For example, our facilities were inspected by the FDA in April and May 2011, December 2012, March 2013, June 2014 and April 2017. The FDA also performed a pre-approval inspection for SINUVA in November 2017, for which we received NDA approval for SINUVA in December 2017. The State of California regulatory authority audited our manufacturing facility in connection with granting a California Device Manufacturing License to us in August 2009 and a pharmacological manufacturing license in December 2017. We have maintained ISO 13485 certification since January 2014 and have been audited by the European Notified Body in Ireland, National Standards Authority of Ireland, or NSAI, on at least an annual basis since 2014. Our facility was last inspected in November 2018 by NSAI and no major nonconformance reports were issued as a result of that inspection. 
 We have manufacturing, supply or service agreements with a number of our single source suppliers. Each of these suppliers manufactures the components they produce for us or tests our components and devices to our specifications. For example, in April 2014, we entered into an agreement with Hovione Inter Ltd., or Hovione, pursuant to which we are required to purchase 80% of our API produced according to our specifications from Hovione, in quantities to be specified in 12-month forecasts provided by us and updated on a quarterly basis. 
 
14 


  This agreement extends until April 2019. In addition, we have agreements with companies who provide sterilization services and analytical testing for our products, as well as suppliers from who we purchase injection molded components to our specifications, our API and our customized packaging components. 
 We typically seek to negotiate new agreements with these vendors in advance of the expiration of the current agreements. We intend to maintain sufficient supplies of the API and components from these single source suppliers in the event that our agreements with one or more of these suppliers were to terminate to enable us to continue to manufacture our implants for a sufficient amount of time necessary to obtain another source of API or components. 
 Government Regulation 
 United States Regulation of Medical Devices and Drugs 
 Our products and any product candidates that contain both device and drug components are regulated as combination products by the FDA. FDAs Office of Combination Products designates a primary mode of action for such drug-device combination products, with the respective primary Center within the FDA leading the regulatory review for the product, in consultation with the secondary designated Center. FDA determined that the primary mode of action for our PROPEL family of products was that of a medical device, so these products have been approved and are regulated as medical devices. By comparison, the primary mode of action of SINUVA was designated to be its drug properties, so this product has been FDA approved and is regulated as a pharmaceutical. 
 FDA regulations require us to register as a medical device and drug product manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, the California Department of Health Services, or CDHS, requires us to register as a medical device and drug manufacturer within the state. In order to maintain CE Markings, we must maintain compliance with ISO 13485. Because of this, the FDA and the NSAI inspect us on a routine basis for compliance with current good manufacturing practices. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities, and product release for distribution. We have undergone and expect to continue to undergo regular current good manufacturing practice inspections in connection with the manufacture of our products at our facility. 
Medical Devices 
 Our PROPEL family of products are regulated in the United States as Class III medical devices by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based upon controls the FDA considers necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, adherence to good manufacturing practices and maintenance of product complaint records but are usually exempt from premarket notification requirements. Class II devices are subject to the same general controls and also are subject to special controls such as performance standards, and FDA guidelines, and may also require clinical testing prior to approval. Class III devices are subject to the highest level of controls and rigorous clinical testing prior to their approval and generally require a PMA, or a PMA supplement approval prior to their sale. 
 Manufacturers must file an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application if human clinical studies of a device are required and if the investigational use of the device represents a potential for significant risk to the patient. The IDE application must be supported by data, typically including the results of animal and engineering testing of the device. If the IDE application is approved by the FDA, human clinical studies may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a maximum number of patients, as approved by the FDA. The clinical studies must be conducted under the review of an independent institutional review board to ensure the protection of the patients rights. 
 
15 


 Generally, upon completion of these human clinical studies, a manufacturer seeks approval of a Class III medical device from the FDA by submitting a PMA application. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including the results of the clinical studies, as well as testing and literature to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device. PMA approval may be conditioned upon the conduct of certain post-approval studies, such as long-term follow-up studies. 
 Drugs 
 The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, serialization, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product SINUVA and any future drug products we may develop and seek to commercialize, are subject to the FDAs drug authority and are governed by extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA, under the FDCA, regulates pharmaceutical products in the United States. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include: 

 | preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------


 | FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-Approval Regulation 
 Following approval, the manufacturer remains subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as off-label use) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the products, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, FDA approval of a new PMA or NDA supplement is required, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 The FDA may also place other conditions on drug approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. 
 FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved PMA or NDA, including product recall. 
 Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we have or may obtain regulatory approval. Sales of our PROPEL family of products, SINUVA, and any of our 
 
16 


  other product candidates, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the products will be covered and the costs of the products will be adequately reimbursed by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for securing coverage for a product is separate from the process for establishing a reimbursement rate for the product if separately payable. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific patient subpopulations and may limit coverage based on product inclusion on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A payors decision to provide coverage for a product does not ensure an adequate reimbursement rate. 
 Medical Devices 
 Our PROPEL family of products are used almost exclusively in the operating room of a hospital or ambulatory surgery center where they are commonly treated as adjunct surgical supplies utilized in sinus surgery and the cost is included in the reimbursement to the facility for the FESS procedure. In the event these procedures are performed in the physician office setting, our PROPEL family of products have been assigned a code under the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, S1090, which may be used to submit requests for product reimbursement to commercial payors. Several existing procedure codes may apply to describe the procedure associated with implant placement. However, payment is subject to payor coverage on the basis of either written medical policies related to the product or individual patient medical necessity. If, as a result of policies the payor has in place regarding these products, hospitals or other service providers are unable to receive adequate reimbursement to support the use of our products, this will negatively impact our revenues and our gross margins will decrease, which will adversely affect our ability to invest in and grow our business. 
Drugs 
 Drugs that are administered incident to a physician service and are separately reportable, are generally billed by providers with HCPCS J codes and are paid based on quarterly price data submitted to CMS, pricing compendia or provider invoice. For SINUVA, we have applied for a product specific HCPCS J code consistent with CMS timelines and requirements for physician-administered drugs used mostly in the office setting of care. Since J codes are assigned by CMS only once per calendar year, until such a product-specific code is assigned, we expect providers will submit claims for reimbursement of SINUVA using an unassigned J code such as J3490, along with the designated National Drug Code for SINUVA. This is the typical path for physician-administered drugs during the interim period between FDA approval and J code assignment. In November 2018, the CMS announced that a product-specific J code for SINUVA was not granted in the 2018 process. We have submitted a new application seeking a product-specific J code in the 2019 process.
