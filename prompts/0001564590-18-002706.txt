 Product Pipeline
 Our product pipeline includes several product candidates with the potential to significantly improve the treatment of patients with cancer.  Our two clinical candidates, trilaciclib and G1T38, are based on our core understanding of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, or CDK4/6, a pair of proteins that play an important role in the growth and proliferation of all human cells.  G1T48 is a potential first-in-class oral Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader, or SERD, which we plan to develop as a single agent and in combination with other agents, including G1T38 for the treatment of ER-positive, or ER+, HER2- breast cancer.  We own the global rights to all our product candidates.

Our CDK4/6 Inhibitor Product Candidates
 CDK4 and CDK6, collectively known as CDK4/6, are key cell signaling proteins that regulate cell growth and proliferation.  The CDK4/6 pathway is critical for cell cycle regulation of both healthy normal cells and certain tumor cells, representing a validated and promising class of targets for anti-cancer therapeutics. An example of normal cells whose growth and proliferation are regulated by CDK4/6, are hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, or HSPCs. HSPCs reside in the bone marrow and are the “reservoir” from which all blood and immune system cells are formed. Additionally, CDK4/6 plays an integral role in the growth and proliferation of certain types of tumors. 
 We have leveraged our deep knowledge in CDK4/6 biology to discover and develop two highly potent and selective CDK4/6 inhibitors that may have broad applicability across multiple cancer indications.  We believe we are the only company with two distinct clinical-stage CDK4/6 inhibitors, trilaciclib and G1T38, each of which has the potential to be the backbone therapy of multiple combination regimens.  Our two CDK4/6 inhibitors were rationally designed to treat distinct patient populations with different combination regimens. 
 Trilaciclib, a short-acting IV therapy, is in development for combinations with chemotherapy and chemotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor regimens. G1T38, an oral therapy, is in development for combinations with other oral targeted therapies.

Trilaciclib: our novel approach to preserve HSPCs from damage by chemotherapy
 Trilaciclib is a potential first-in-class, short-acting CDK4/6 inhibitor which we are developing to be administered intravenously prior to chemotherapy. In preclinical studies, administration of trilaciclib prior to chemotherapy has been shown to induce transient cell-cycle arrest of HSPCs, protect HSPCs from chemotherapy-induced damage, preserve bone marrow and immune system function, protect against bone marrow exhaustion, improve complete blood counts (CBC) recovery, prevent myeloid skewing and consequent lymphopenia, and enhance T-cell effector function in the tumor microenvironment.
 Following evaluation of trilaciclib in a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers, we initiated two Phase 1b/2a trials in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC); one in a first-line setting (in combination with carboplatin/etoposide) and the other in a second-/third line setting (in combination with topotecan). Enrollment in the open label Phase 1b portions of both trials has been completed and preliminary data were reported in 2016 and 2017; response rates and tolerability compared favorably to historical chemotherapy-only trials. In the Phase 1b parts of these two trials, we treated 51 patients with over 250 cycles of trilaciclib and chemotherapy, and did not have a single episode of febrile neutropenia – one of the most common adverse consequences of these chemotherapy regimens. Further, there were no drug-related serious adverse events reported during the Phase 1b parts of these two trials. There were some adverse events reported involving fatigue and cytopenias, but those adverse events were less severe and less frequent than those generally reported in trials involving the use of chemotherapy alone.
 Based on these encouraging preliminary data, we advanced both of these SCLC trials into the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2a parts. Enrollment in the first-line SCLC Phase 2a trial was completed in the second quarter of 2017 and unblinded preliminary data will be reported in March 2018; at that time, we will also update data from the Phase 1b patients of the trial. Enrollment in the second-/third-line SCLC Phase 2a trial is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, with unblinded preliminary data (as well as updated Phase 1b data) reported in the fourth quarter of 2018. In 2017 we initiated a randomized Phase 2 trial of trilaciclib in patients with first-/second-/third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin.  Enrollment is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, with preliminary data reported in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Finally, as part of our non-exclusive collaboration with Genentech, in 2017 we initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 trial of trilaciclib in combination with Tecentriq® (atezolizumab)/carboplatin/etoposide in first-line SCLC patients. We completed enrollment in February 2018; as the primary endpoint of this trial is overall-survival, data read-out is event driven, and is not expected until 2019 or later.
 Market opportunities for trilaciclib
 Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States with approximately 1.7 million new cases and 600,000 deaths in 2016. Chemotherapy is still the standard of care treatment for multiple cancers. We estimate that more than one million patients in the United States receive chemotherapy annually.
 Chemotherapy has significant clinical utility and continues to be the most effective treatment for many cancers. However, it also damages HSPCs (myelosuppression) and the immune system (immunosuppression), leading to severe adverse effects and limiting anti-tumor activity.  Chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression causes abnormally low numbers of red blood cells, or anemia, abnormally low numbers of neutrophils, or neutropenia, and/or abnormally low numbers of platelets, or thrombocytopenia. The treatment and prevention of myelosuppressive side effects of chemotherapy is a large market opportunity. The only current treatment for chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression is growth factor support. Two main types of commercially available growth factors are: granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, or GCSF, and erythropoiesis stimulating agents, or ESAs. GCSF increases production of neutrophils in patients to reduce the incidence of infection after chemotherapy. GCSF does not preserve the function of the bone marrow and immune system from chemotherapy damage. ESAs increase production of red blood cells in patients. Accordingly, ESAs also do not preserve the function of the bone marrow and immune system from chemotherapy. ESA use in oncology has diminished recently due to a “black box” warning related to death and serious cardiovascular events. Despite these limitations, we estimate that annual worldwide sales of growth factor support therapy in oncology exceeds $7 billion.
 Our first trial for trilaciclib is in first-line treatment of extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer, or SCLC. SCLC is inherently CDK4/6-independent and accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancers. Approximately 31,000 people are diagnosed annually with SCLC in the United States and approximately 70%, or 21,000, of those have extensive-stage disease. First-line treatment for extensive-stage SCLC is typically a chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin and etoposide, each of which has significant myelosuppressive side effects. While these patients often respond to chemotherapy, approximately 90% progress within one year and die within two years. Five-year survival rates are less than 5% for patients with extensive-stage SCLC. The last drug approved for the treatment of patients with SCLC was topotecan in 2007, which was approved in a second/third line setting and is highly myelosuppressive.
 We are also exploring the use of trilaciclib in Triple Negative Breast Cancer, or TNBC. According to the World Cancer Research Fund International, breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world and the most prevalent cancer in women, with an estimated 1.7 million cases of breast cancer diagnosed annually worldwide. TNBC makes up approximately 15-20% of such diagnosed breast cancers. Because TNBC cells lack key growth-signaling receptors, patients do not respond well to medications that 
 3

block estrogen, progesterone, or HER2 receptors. Instead, treating TNBC typically involves chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. In general, survival rates tend to be lower with TNBC compared to other forms of breast cancer, and TNBC is also more likely than some other types of breast cancer to return after it has been treated, especially in the first few years after treatment.
 There are currently approximately 300 trials of which we are aware evaluating checkpoint inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy. We believe that administering trilaciclib with chemotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor combinations may increase efficacy. We are collaborating non-exclusively with Genentech to explore the utility of trilaciclib and their checkpoint inhibitor Tecentriq combined with chemotherapy. Our first targeted indication is first-line SCLC and we initiated a Phase 2 trial in combination with Tecentriq in the second quarter of 2017. We also anticipate trials in other indications.
 Advantages of trilaciclib
 We believe that treating patients with trilaciclib prior to the administration of chemotherapy may have the following benefits and advantages:
  
• | Potential to minimize chemotherapy-induced myelotoxicity and immunosuppression. Trilaciclib has been rationally designed and optimized to preserve HSPCs from damage by chemotherapy, thereby minimizing cytopenias across all four blood lineages: red cells, platelets, neutrophils and lymphocytes. Trilaciclib has the potential to decrease the clinically relevant consequences of these cytopenias, such as febrile neutropenia. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to reduce chemotherapy dose-delays and dose reductions. Chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression is the major dose limiting toxicity of cytotoxic chemotherapy and can lead to dose reductions and schedule delays that can limit therapeutic benefit. Trilaciclib has been designed specifically to minimize myelosuppression and has the potential to enable maintenance of the indicated and planned chemotherapeutic dose and schedule.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. There are currently approximately 300 trials of which we are aware evaluating checkpoint inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy. We believe that administering trilaciclib with chemotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor combinations may increase efficacy. We are collaborating non-exclusively with Genentech to explore the utility of trilaciclib and their checkpoint inhibitor Tecentriq combined with chemotherapy. Our first indication is first-line SCLC and we initiated a Phase 2 trial in combination with Tecentriq in the second quarter of 2017.We also anticipate trials in other indications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential broad applicability. We believe trilaciclib has the potential to benefit patients treated with multiple myelosuppressive chemotherapeutic regimens across a wide range of oncology indications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convenience of administration. Trilaciclib is designed to be administered via an IV infusion prior to chemotherapy treatment. This dosing regimen fits with standard clinical practice for chemotherapy and/or checkpoint inhibitor treatment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced potential of secondary hematological malignancies. Chemotherapy has been linked with secondary types of cancer that may occur years after initial treatment. HSPCs are especially sensitive to chemotherapy, and damage to HSPCs by chemotherapy can lead to both myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia. We believe that protecting HSPCs from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy has the potential to reduce incidence of these secondary hematological malignancies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to reduce the overall cost of care. Chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression leads to severe adverse side effects, such as fatigue due to anemia, infections due to neutropenia, and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. These adverse side effects often require costly hospitalizations, transfusions, antibiotic usage and/or treatment with growth factor support. Because trilaciclib has been designed specifically to minimize myelosuppression, we believe that it has the potential to reduce the overall cost of care. Our market research with payers supports the value proposition of trilaciclib.

Trilaciclib: preclinical and clinical development
 Preclinical development
 We have published extensive biochemical, cellular and in vivo data on trilaciclib from 2015-2017.  Our preclinical data show that trilaciclib can induce transient and reversible cell-cycle arrest of HSPCs; protect HSPCs from damage by chemotherapy; preserve bone marrow and immune system function; improve CBC recovery; protect from bone marrow exhaustion; prevent myeloid skewing and consequent lymphopenia; activate T-cells in the tumor microenvironment; and enhance chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor anti-tumor activity.
 Completed Phase 1 clinical trial
 In 2015, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of trilaciclib in 45 healthy volunteers in the Netherlands. In this trial, subjects in seven cohorts were administered a single ascending dose of trilaciclib between 6 mg/m² and 192 mg/m². The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the safety including dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, serious adverse events, or SAEs, adverse events, or AEs, and pharmacokinetics, or PK, and identify a biologically effective dose of trilaciclib. Published data from this trial demonstrated that trilaciclib was well tolerated, with no DLTs or SAEs reported. These data demonstrated that the administration of trilaciclib resulted in the robust cell-cycle arrest of HSPCs for at least 32 hours and supported a starting dose of 200 mg/m 2 for the initial studies in patients.

 Ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in first-line treatment of SCLC
 In 2015, we initiated a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in first-line extensive-stage SCLC patients across multiple sites in the United States and Europe. The Phase 1b segment of the trial was designed to confirm the trilaciclib dose to be used in the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a segment. The goals of the trial are to evaluate the safety, myelopreservation, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of trilaciclib in combination with the existing first-line chemotherapy standard of care regimen of etoposide and carboplatin and to confirm the dose to be used in future trials. All patients in the Phase 1b segment were administered three-week cycles of trilaciclib plus etoposide/carboplatin, with an estimated four to six cycles administered in total per patient based on historical practice. Trilaciclib was administered as an IV infusion prior to every dose of etoposide/carboplatin.
 In the Phase 1b section of this trial, as reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meetings in June 2017, we treated 19 patients with multiple cycles of trilaciclib and chemotherapy and did not have a single episode of febrile neutropenia – one of the most common adverse consequences of these chemotherapy regimens. We also observed a dose dependent reduction in grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events.  The results from the Phase 1b study support the hypothesis that trilaciclib could ameliorate the significant acute and long-term consequences of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression by preserving hematopoietic and immune system function. Based on these results, we initiated the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a segment of the trial in fourth-quarter of 2016 with a trilaciclib dose of 240 mg/m2 and completed enrollment of a total of 77 patients in the second quarter of 2017.  We expect to update the data from the Phase 1b segment of the trial and to report preliminary data from the Phase 2a segment of the trial in March 2018.

Ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in second/third-line treatment of SCLC
 In 2015, we initiated a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in second/third-line SCLC patients across multiple sites in the United States and Europe. The Phase 1b segment of the trial was designed to confirm the trilaciclib dose to be used in the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a segment of the trial. The goals of the trial are to evaluate the safety, myelopreservation, PK, and anti-tumor activity of trilaciclib in combination with the existing second/third-line chemotherapy standard of care regimen of topotecan and to confirm the dose to be used in future trials. All patients in the Phase 1b segment were administered three-week cycles of trilaciclib plus topotecan until the progression of disease. Trilaciclib was administered as an IV infusion prior to every dose of topotecan. Trilaciclib doses of 200 to 280 mg/m2 and topotecan doses of 0.75 to 1.5 mg/m2 were tested across 7 cohorts in the completed Phase 1b open-label segment of the trial. Upon completion of the Phase 1b segment of the trial, the doses chosen for the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a segment of this trial are trilaciclib 240 mg/m2 + topotecan 0.75 mg/m2 and trilaciclib 240 mg/m2 + topotecan 1.5 mg/m2.
 
In the Phase 1b segment we treated 32 patients with trilaciclib and topotecan without any episodes of febrile neutropenia or treatment related SAEs. Preliminary results from Phase 1b were reported at the IASCLC World Conference on Lung Cancer in December 2016. Based on these results, the Phase 2a segment was initiated in the first quarter of 2017 and consists of a double blind-design with approximately 90 patients randomized on a 2:1 basis to receive trilaciclib plus topotecan, or placebo plus topotecan. We plan to complete enrollment in this trial in the second quarter of 2018. We expect to update the data from the Phase 1b segment of the trial and to report preliminary data from the Phase 2a segment of the trial in the fourth quarter of 2018.
 Ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
 In January 2017, we initiated an open label, randomized, Phase 2 trial that is expected to enroll approximately 90 patients with first, second or third-line metastatic TNBC across multiple sites in the United States and Europe. The goals of the clinical trial are to evaluate the safety, myelopreservation, PK, and anti-tumor activity of trilaciclib in combination with the existing chemotherapy standard of care regimen of gemcitabine and carboplatin. We expect to fully enroll this trial in the second-quarter of 2018 and report preliminary data in the fourth-quarter of 2018.
 Ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in first-line treatment of SCLC with a checkpoint inhibitor
 In December 2016, we entered into a non-exclusive agreement with Genentech to evaluate the combination of Genentech's immune checkpoint, anti-PD-L1 antibody Tecentriq with trilaciclib. Our first trial under the agreement is in first-line treatment for patients with extensive stage SCLC receiving carboplatin and etoposide.  We initiated enrollment in this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in the second quarter of 2017.  The goals of the clinical trial are to evaluate the safety, overall survival, myelopreservation, PK, and anti-tumor activity of trilaciclib in combination with Tecentriq and chemotherapy.  We completed enrollment in the first quarter of 2018.
 
G1T38: Our potential best-in-class CDK4/6 inhibitor for patients with CDK4/6-dependent tumors
 G1T38, our second clinical-stage candidate, is a potential best-in-class oral CDK4/6 inhibitor, to be used in combination with other targeted therapies to treat multiple cancers. We rationally designed G1T38 to improve upon and address the shortcomings of the approved CDK4/6 inhibitors Ibrance®, Kisqali® and Verzenio®. Our preclinical data and early human clinical data indicate the potential for continuous daily dosing, less dose-limiting neutropenia, and improved tolerability. A Phase 1 trial of G1T38 in 75 healthy volunteers showed a favorable safety profile, and we initiated a Phase 1b/2a trial in ER+, HER2- breast cancer in January 2017. Our plans for G1T38 include combinations in other cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, where we expect to begin a Phase 1b/2 trial in March 2018 in combination with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, Tagrisso®. We believe that G1T38 has the potential to be the backbone therapy of multiple combination targeted therapy regimens.
 Market opportunity for G1T38
 The importance of CDK4/6 as a key regulator of tumor cell growth and proliferation in certain tumors has been validated by the FDA’s approval of Pfizer’s CDK4/6 inhibitor Ibrance for the treatment of ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer as initial endocrine therapy in combination with an aromatase inhibitor in post-menopausal women and in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy in combination with fulvestrant, the approval in 2017 of Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, and the approval in 2017 of Verzenio in combination with fulvestrant. Worldwide sales of Ibrance were $2.1 billion and $3.1 billion in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Wall Street analysts estimate Ibrance peak annual worldwide sales to exceed $7 billion.

Advantages of G1T38
 We believe that G1T38 has the potential to be a best-in-class CDK4/6 inhibitor. There are currently three other CDK4/6 inhibitors approved to treat ER+, HER2- breast cancer - Ibrance, Kisqali, and Verzenio. Each of these drugs has shortcomings that we believe could be addressed by a best-in-class CDK4/6 inhibitor. Ibrance and Kisqali have long half-lives that can lead to drug accumulation and neutropenia, requiring a dosing regimen of 21 days on drug and a treatment holiday of at least seven days off drug. Kisqali has also exhibited cardiovascular and liver side effects.  Verzenio has demonstrated significant gastrointestinal issues, which can require administration of antidiarrheal therapies.  Verzenio has also exhibited liver and blood clotting side effects.
 
We believe that G1T38 has the potential to be best-in-class because of the following advantages:
  
• | Less myelotoxicity. In preclinical studies, G1T38 has demonstrated less myelotoxicity than Ibrance, but equivalent anti-tumor efficacy. We believe this is due to the inherently different PK properties of G1T38.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for continuous daily dosing. Patients on Ibrance and Kisqali can only be given the drug on a 21 days-on, followed by 7 days-off, schedule. Even with this dosing holiday, dose-delays and dose reductions due to persistent neutropenia are common. Our preclinical data and clinical data to date with G1T38 support the potential for continuous daily dosing with less dose-limiting neutropenia.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved cardiovascular and liver safety. G1T38 has not shown any of the QT prolongation issues (seen with Kisqali) and liver injury (seen with Kisqali and Verzenio).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved tolerability profile. We have designed G1T38 to be selective for CDK4/6 and have minimal CDK2 activity, as inhibition of CDK2 has been associated with gastrointestinal toxicities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Greater potential for combination therapies. We believe that G1T38 is the only selective CDK4/6 inhibitor in development that is not currently owned by a large pharmaceutical company. We believe that other pharmaceutical and biotech companies with targeted therapies may want to test a combination of their therapies with our CDK4/6 inhibitor. Accordingly, we believe we are in a strong position to explore collaborative arrangements with these companies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 G1T38: preclinical and clinical development
 Preclinical development
 We have published extensive biochemical, cellular and in vivo data on G1T38 demonstrating: high potency and selectivity for CDK4/6; equivalent anti-tumor activity to Ibrance when dosed orally once daily for 28-days in a mouse model of ER+, HER2- breast cancer; less myelotoxicity than Ibrance in mouse models, suggesting the potential for continuous daily dosing without the need for a treatment holiday; and anti-tumor efficacy in models of certain CDK4/6-dependent tumor types, such as NSCLC and castrate resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC.
 Completed Phase 1 clinical trial
 In the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of G1T38 in 75 healthy volunteers in the Netherlands. This was a single ascending dose, placebo-controlled trial testing doses of 3 to 600 mg. In addition, G1T38 was dosed at 200 and 300 mg twice a day, 300 mg with and without food, and 300 mg as an oral solution. The goals of the clinical trial were to obtain PK and safety data to inform appropriate starting dose(s) for studies in patients. There were no DLTs, SAEs, or grade 3/4 AEs reported in this study.

 Ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in ER+, HER2- breast cancer
 In January 2017, we initiated a Phase 1b/2a trial in ER+, HER2- breast cancer patients in combination with Faslodex®, an FDA-approved SERD. The trial is expected to enroll up to 100 patients in Europe. The goals of the clinical trial are to evaluate the safety, PK, and anti-tumor activity of G1T38 in combination with Faslodex and to determine the dose to be used in future trials. The Phase 1b 
 7

segment of the trial is open-label and consists of two arms, with G1T38 dosed continuously without a holiday, either once a day or twice a day in combination with Faslodex. Once the dose and schedule have been determined, the Phase 2a segment will enroll approximately 30 patients at the recommended G1T38 dose and schedule in combination with Faslodex. All patients in the trial are being administered G1T38 orally continuously without a treatment holiday and intramuscular, or IM, Faslodex per the label. Tumor lesions are being assessed under RECIST criteria by CT scans or MRI every 8 weeks.
 Early clinical data from the first 24 patients enrolled in the trial suggest that G1T38 may be able to address the shortcomings of the other CDK4/6 inhibitors. G1T38 has a shorter half-life and larger volume of distribution than Ibrance and Kisqali and is not expected to show drug accumulation. All of the enrolled patients had a decline in neutrophil counts, which is expected and due to a mechanism-based decrease in neutrophil production caused by G1T38, which also occurs with other CDK4/6 inhibitors such as Ibrance and Kisqali. No cardiovascular or liver side effects have been reported so far and there have been no G1T38-related SAEs. The incidence of gastrointestinal AEs reported so far are similar to Ibrance and Kisqali and less than Verzenio. These early clinical data indicate the potential for continuous daily dosing of G1T38 without a holiday in combination with Faslodex, and the potential for improved tolerability compared to other marketed CDK4/6 inhibitors. We expect to report preliminary data from the Phase 1b segment of this trial in the second quarter of 2018.
 G1T48: Our oral SERD
 G1T48 is a potential first/best-in-class oral SERD, which we plan to initially develop as a single agent and in combination with G1T38 for the treatment of ER+, HER2- breast cancer. We believe we are in a unique position as the only emerging biopharmaceutical company with a wholly owned, proprietary combination of a SERD and an oral CDK4/6 inhibitor, a validated regimen in ER+, HER2- breast cancer. Based on compelling preclinical efficacy and safety data, we filed an Investigational New Drug application (IND) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the fourth quarter of 2017. With the IND now open, we expect to initiate a clinical trial in the second quarter of 2018.
 Market opportunity for G1T48
 Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women, accounting for 30% of all female cancers in the United States. The major cause of death from breast cancer is metastases, and approximately 30% of early-stage patients develop metastatic disease. Approximately 65% of breast cancers are ER+ and depend on estrogen signaling for growth and survival of the malignant cells. Patients with ER+ breast cancers are typically treated with endocrine therapies such as aromatase inhibitors, or AIs, selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs, and SERDs. AIs, which block the generation of estrogen, and SERMs, which selectively inhibit an ER’s ability to bind estrogen, both block ER-dependent signaling but leave functional ERs present in breast cancer cells. For this reason, although AIs and SERMs are effective treatments for some breast cancers, many patients acquire resistance to them by developing the ability to signal through the ER in a ligand-independent manner. In contrast, SERDs are a class of endocrine therapies that directly induce ER degradation. Therefore, it is believed that SERDs have the potential to treat ER+ tumors without allowing ligand-independent resistance to develop, and to act on AI- and SERM-resistant ER-positive tumors.
 Currently only one SERD, Faslodex, is approved for the treatment of ER+ metastatic breast cancer. Faslodex is administered as an IM injection, and requires a loading dose during the first month of treatment. This means it is typically given on days 1, 15, and 29 of treatment and then once monthly thereafter. Each treatment typically consists of two injections, one into each buttock. Injection site reactions are common, occurring in approximately 10% of patients. Injection site related events including sciatica, neuralgia, neuropathic pain, and peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Other frequently reported adverse reactions with Faslodex include nausea (9.7%) and bone pain (9.4%).
 While there are several oral SERDs in early clinical development, no one candidate has emerged as a clear front runner as an oral alternative to Faslodex based on early results. Limited efficacy has been reported in some of the oral SERDs in development and one has been shown to possess ER agonist activity without complete receptor degradation, suggesting that it is a SERM rather than a SERD with complete antagonist activity.
 Advantages of G1T48
 We believe that G1T48 has the potential to be first/best-in-class because of the following advantages:
  
• | Higher potency. In preclinical models of ER+, HER2- breast cancer, G1T48 is more potent than Faslodex in binding and degrading the ER and inhibiting cell growth.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved oral efficacy. G1T48 demonstrated improved activity compared to another oral SERD in development in preclinical models of endocrine resistance mediated by ER mutation. G1T48 also demonstrated better efficacy than other oral SERDs in development in a tamoxifen resistant model of ER+, HER2- breast cancer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Ease of administration. The only approved SERD, Faslodex, is required to be given via IM injection. We have designed G1T48 to be administered orally.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wholly owned proprietary combination regimen. To our knowledge, we are the only emerging biopharmaceutical company with both an oral SERD (G1T48) and an oral CDK4/6 inhibitor (G1T38). We believe that being in the unique position of having this wholly owned proprietary combination of a validated regimen for the treatment of ER+, HER2- breast cancer provides us a strategic and competitive advantage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 G1T48: Preclinical development
 We have presented extensive biochemical, cellular and in vivo data on G1T48 demonstrating that it: has drug-like properties, is highly potent, is active on ER mutant receptors, is highly selective, leads to complete ER degradation, demonstrated a favorable safety profile, and has oral efficacy. 
 
We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in the second quarter of 2018 with the goal of evaluating the safety, tolerability, and PK of the drug in breast cancer patients.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our goal is to be a leader in the discovery and development of CDK4/6 inhibitor-based treatments for cancer. Our strategy includes the following key components:
  
• | Develop trilaciclib in combination with chemotherapy across multiple indications. We believe that trilaciclib has the potential to be used to treat patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy across multiple oncology indications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop trilaciclib in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We believe that using trilaciclib in combination with chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors has the potential to significantly enhance efficacy. In December 2016, we entered into a collaboration with Genentech to evaluate trilaciclib in combination with Genentech’s checkpoint inhibitor Tecentriq in multiple indications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop G1T38 as a best-in-class treatment across multiple cancer indications. We believe that G1T38 has the potential for less dose-limiting neutropenia than Ibrance and Kisqali and an improved safety/tolerability profile versus Kisqali and Verzenio. We plan to develop G1T38 across multiple cancer indications, either alone or with one or more strategic collaborators.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly advance G1T48 into clinical trials in combination with G1T38. The use of a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with a SERD has been validated by the FDA approval and commercial success of Ibrance. With an oral SERD (G1T48) and an oral CDK4/6 inhibitor (G1T38), we believe we are in a unique position as the only emerging biopharmaceutical company with a wholly owned proprietary combination for this validated anti-cancer regimen.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue global development of combination therapies. We believe our expertise in CDK4/6 biology puts us in an advantageous position to develop proprietary best-in-combination or first-in-combination therapies with the potential for improved efficacy and safety. We are developing G1T38 to be used in combination with other targeted therapies such as SERDs. The approval of Ibrance has created significant interest in the use of selective CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with other targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer. Ibrance, Kisqali and the other selective CDK4/6 inhibitor in clinical development are owned by large pharmaceutical companies. As a result, we believe that we are in a strong position to explore collaborative arrangements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are interested in combining their targeted therapies with G1T38.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a fully integrated oncology company. We plan to commercialize our product candidates on our own in the United States using a small and highly specialized sales force. We may also establish global or regional collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to leverage their development and commercialization capabilities and enable us to maximize the potential of our product candidates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commercialization
 Given our stage of development, we have not yet established our own commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We believe our focus on oncology will enable us to efficiently commercialize our product candidates on our own in the United States using a small and highly specialized sales force. However, we may also establish global or regional collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to leverage their development and commercialization capabilities to maximize the potential of our product candidates.

Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any drugs that we may commercialize. To date, we have obtained active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, formulations, and drug products for trilaciclib, G1T38 and G1T48 for our preclinical studies and clinical trials from multiple third-party manufacturers. We obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. Redundant suppliers are in place for some of our APIs.  As development proceeds for our product candidates, we will evaluate qualifying additional redundant manufacturers for API and drug product.  
Competition
 The development and commercialization of new drug therapies is highly competitive. We will face competition with respect to all therapeutics we may develop or commercialize in the future from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide. If any of our product candidates is approved, they will compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of the same indications, and potentially with product candidates currently in development for the same indications. Many of the entities marketing or developing potentially competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing. We believe the key competitive factors affecting the success of any approved product will be its efficacy, safety profile, price, convenience of administration, and level of promotional activity. Accordingly, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop.
 If trilaciclib is approved, it will compete with:
  
• | existing growth factor support treatments, including Neulasta® (pegfigrastim), Neupogen® (filgrastim), Procrit® (epoeitin alpha), and Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) as well as biosimilars of these products when available;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if approved, Rova-T® (rovalpituzumab tesirine), an antibody drug conjugate currently being developed by AbbVie for the treatment of patients with SCLC;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if approved, the multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with SCLC; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | multiple approved drugs or drugs that may be approved in the future for indications for which we may develop trilaciclib.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If G1T38 is approved, it will compete with:
  
• | Pfizer’s approved CDK4/6 inhibitor Ibrance;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Novartis’s approved CDK4/6 inhibitor Kisqali;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Eli Lilly’s approved CDK4/6 inhibitor Verzenio;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | if approved, other non-selective CDK4/6 inhibitor product candidates in clinical development, including product candidates being developed by FLX Bio and Onconova Therapeutics; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | multiple approved drugs or drugs that may be approved in the future for indications for which we may develop G1T38.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If G1T48 is approved, it will compete with:
  
• | the approved IM SERD, Faslodex, being marketed by AstraZeneca;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | if approved, other oral SERDs in development including: RAD1901, being developed by Radius Health; GDC-9545, being developed by Genentech; AZD9496, being developed by AstraZeneca; SAR439859, being developed by Sanofi; and LSZ102, being developed by Novartis; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | multiple approved drugs or drugs that may be approved in the future for indications for which we may develop G1T48.

Intellectual property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our CDK4/6 inhibitor molecules, including our CDK4/6 inhibitors in clinical trials and methods of treatment using our CDK4/6 inhibitors, alone and in combination with other therapeutic agents. We also seek protection on processes for the production of our CDK4/6 inhibitors, formulations incorporating our CDK4/6 inhibitors, combinations of our product candidates with other active agents and dosing 
 10

schedules and regimens related to our CDK4/6 inhibitors. Our success also depends on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications covering our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. In addition, we plan to seek patent term adjustments, restorations, and/or patent term extensions where applicable in the United States and other jurisdictions. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit, where appropriate, from statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe and other countries that provide a period of clinical data exclusivity to compensate for the time required for regulatory approval of our drug products. See also the “Government Regulation and Product Approval” section below. 
 We are the sole owner or exclusive licensee of all of our patents and currently filed patent applications that cover our product candidates. Our intellectual property strategy is focused on patenting our CDK4/6 inhibitors, their uses, and methods of manufacturing as well as our licensed-in applications directed to selective estrogen receptor degraders and their uses, manufacture, and combination with our CDK 4/6 inhibitors. We have obtained eleven composition-of-matter patents in the United States on a number of our CDK4/6 inhibitors, including claims that cover our product candidates trilaciclib and G1T38, and we continue to seek composition-of-matter patents on additional CDK4/6 inhibitors both in the United States and throughout the world. In addition, we have obtained three method of treatment patents in the United States on a number of our CDK4/6 inhibitors, including claims that cover our product candidates trilaciclib and G1T38. We continue to seek additional patents for our key CDK4/6 inhibitors and their uses in key therapeutic areas. We also seek patent protection on methods of treatment that incorporate our CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with other therapeutic agents to treat specific clinical indications and targeted patient populations. Furthermore, we will seek, where appropriate, patent protection on processes of making certain CDK4/6 inhibitors, and intermediates used in the processes.
 We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategies as we develop new technologies and product candidates. We plan to file additional patent applications based on our intellectual property strategies where appropriate, including where we seek to adapt to competition or to improve business opportunities. Further, we plan to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, to protect new technologies that we develop. Our patent filing strategy generally includes seeking patent protection in the United States, the European Union and in additional countries where we believe such protection is likely to be useful, including one or more of Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, and South Korea.
 Our owned and in-licensed patent estate as of December 31, 2017, on a worldwide basis, includes 132 granted or pending patent applications spread over 23 patent families with 14 granted U.S. patents, 21 pending U.S. applications, eight pending international patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and 89 pending or granted patents that have entered the national phase of prosecution in countries outside the United States. The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In the countries in which we currently file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application which serves as a priority application. However, the term of a U.S. patent may be extended to compensate for the time required to obtain regulatory approval to sell a drug (a patent term extension) or by delays encountered during patent prosecution that are caused by the USPTO (referred to as patent term adjustment). For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review and diligence during the review process. Patent term extensions cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent covering an approved drug or its method of use may be extended. A similar kind of patent extension, referred to as a Supplementary Protection Certificate, is available in Europe. Legal frameworks are also available in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent. We currently intend to seek patent term extensions on any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where we have a qualifying patent and the extension is available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Further, even if our patent is extended, the patent, including the extended portion of the patent, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of final jurisdiction in the United States or a foreign country.
 Our current issued patents covering the composition of matter for our present clinical candidates trilaciclib and G1T38 will expire in 2031, exclusive of any patent term extension, and patent applications covering our clinical candidate G1T48 will expire in 2036, if issued and exclusive of any patent term extension. Our pending applications on additional methods of use of our clinical candidates, should they issue, will expire on dates ranging from 2034 to 2037. We plan to file additional applications on aspects of our innovations that may have patent terms that extend beyond these dates. However, any of our patents, including patents that we may rely on to protect our market for approved drugs, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of final jurisdiction. Alternatively, we may decide that it is in our interest to settle a litigation in a manner that affects the term or enforceability of our patent. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that have been or may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to obtain and maintain our proprietary position for our CDK4/6 inhibitors and technology will depend on our success in enforcing the claims that have been 
 11

granted or may grant. We do not know whether any of the pending patent applications that we have filed or may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any additional patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize drugs with similar mechanisms of action and duplicate our methods of treatments or strategies without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.
 Trilaciclib and G1T38 patent coverage
 We own two issued U.S. Patents (U.S. 8,598,186 and U.S. 8,598,197) and one allowed U.S. application covering the trilaciclib compositions-of-matter and its pharmaceutical composition. We also own three issued U.S. Patents (U.S. 8,598,186; U.S. 8,598,197; and U.S. 9,481,691) and one allowed U.S. application covering the G1T38 composition-of-matter and pharmaceutical composition. We own corresponding issued patents covering trilaciclib and G1T38 and their pharmaceutical compositions in Europe, Canada, Japan, Mexico, China, Australia, Russia, and Singapore. There are additional pending applications covering these compounds and compositions in Europe, China, Brazil, Canada, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Russia. The expected year of expiration for these composition-of-matter patents, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2031, without regard to any extensions, adjustments, or restorations of term that may be available under national law.
 In addition, we own an issued U.S. Patent (U.S. 9,487,530) and one pending U.S. application covering the use of trilaciclib to reduce the effect of chemotherapy on healthy cells in a subject being treated for CDK4/6 replication independent cancer. This patent family covers, for example, SCLC treatment protocols involving chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin, etoposide, and/or topotecan along with trilaciclib for protection of healthy replicating cells like hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The patent filing also covers chemoprotection of healthy replicating cells with trilaciclib during the treatment of CDK4/6 independent cancer including triple negative breast cancer. This patent filing is also pending in Europe, Canada, China, Hong Kong and Japan. In January 2018, this patent filing was allowed in China. The expected year of expiration for this patent family, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2034, without regard to any extensions, adjustments, or restorations of term that may be available under national law.
 We also own a U.S. application that covers an advantageous pharmacokinetic profile target of trilaciclib for the protection of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during chemotherapy. The expected year of expiration for this patent application, if issued, valid and enforceable, is 2036, without regard to any extensions, adjustments, or restorations of term that may be available under U.S. law.
 We have filed an international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty that covers the administration of trilaciclib in combination with a PD-L1 inhibitor such as Tecentriq. The expected year of expiration for this patent family, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2037, without regard to any extensions, adjustments, or restorations of term that may be available under national law.
 In addition, we own a U.S. application that is directed to the treatment of retinoblastoma protein-negative, or RB-negative, tumors with the administration of a topoisomerase inhibitor in combination with trilaciclib, to protect hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during chemotherapeutic treatment. The expected year of expiration of this patent application, if issued, valid and enforceable, is 2035, without regard to any extensions, adjustments, or restorations of term that may be available under U.S. law.
 We own two patent families that are directed to the use of G1T38 to treat RB-positive tumors. The first family includes an issued U.S. Patent (U.S. 9,527,857) and one pending U.S. application directed to the treatment of RB-positive cancers with G1T38. The issued patent covers the use of G1T38, to treat RB-positive breast cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, NSCL cancer, prostate cancer, and glioblastoma. This patent filing is also pending in Europe, Canada, China, Hong Kong and Japan. The expected year of expiration for this patent family, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2034, without regard to any extensions, adjustments, or restorations of term that may be available under national law. The second family includes a U.S. patent application and a European patent application  directed to the treatment of RB-positive cancers with G1T38 with additional active agents. The expected year of expiration for this patent family, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2035, without regard to any extensions, adjustments, or restorations of term that may be available under national law.
 We own a patent family directed to the use of G1T38 as an anti-neoplastic agent against a T or B cell cancer. This patent filing is also pending in Europe, Canada, China and Japan. The expected year of expiration for this patent family, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2034, without regard to any extensions, adjustments, or restorations of term that may be available under national law.
 We have filed a patent application that covers the administration of G1T38 in combination with an EGFR inhibitor. The expected year of expiration for this patent, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2038, without regard to any extensions, adjustments, or restorations of term that may be available under national law.

G1T48 Patent Coverage
 We have exclusively licensed from University of Illinois, or UIC, three international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and two U.S. pending applications that cover G1T48 and related compounds and their pharmaceutical compositions and use as selective estrogen receptor down-regulators. The expected year of expiration for this patent family, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2036, without regard to any extensions, adjustments, or restorations of term that may be available under national law. Under the Exclusive License Agreement with UIC, G1 has the right to prosecute the licensed applications, subject to review by UIC. 
 We co-own, along with UIC, one U.S. patent application, which converted to a PCT application on January 6, 2018, directed to the combination of G1T48 and related compounds with G1T38 and related compounds for the treatment of estrogen-modulated disorders such as RB-positive breast cancer. We have exclusively licensed UIC’s rights in this co-owned application. The expected year of expiration for this patent family, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2037, without regard to any extensions, adjustments, or restorations of term that may be available under national law.
 A number of our pending patent applications covering certain aspects of using our current clinical candidates have not yet issued. As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to obtain and maintain a proprietary position on our drug candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims on these pending patents and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. 
 Any issued patents that we have received or may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drug candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our clinical candidates. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in pharmaceuticals is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our clinical candidates.
 Exclusive license for G1T48
 In November 2016, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Illinois, or UIC, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale of certain SERDs, including G1T48, covered by patent rights owned UIC. The rights licensed to us are for all fields of use.
 Under the terms of the agreement we paid a one-time only, non-refundable upfront fee of $500,000, and we are required to pay UIC low single-digit royalties on all net sales of products and a share of any sublicensing revenues. We are also obligated to pay annual maintenance fees, which are fully creditable against any royalty payments made by us. We may also be required to pay UIC milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $2.625 million related to the initiation and execution of clinical trials and first commercial sale of a product in multiple countries. We are responsible for all future patent prosecution costs.
 The term of the license agreement will continue on a country-by-country basis until the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim within the patent rights covering the product in such country, (ii) the expiration of market exclusivity in such country and (iii) the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale in such country. UIC may terminate the agreement in the event (i) we fail to pay any amount or make any report when required to be made and fail to cure such failure within 30 days after receipt of notice, (ii) we are in breach of any provision of the agreement and fail to remedy such breach within 45 days after receipt of notice, (iii) we make a report to UIC under the agreement that is determined to be materially false, (iv) we declare insolvency or bankruptcy or (v) we take any action that causes patent rights or technical information to be subject to any lien or encumbrance and fail to remedy within 45 days of receipt of notice. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon at least 90 days’ written notice. Upon expiration or termination of the agreement, all rights revert to UIC.
 Trade secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently 
 13

discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Government regulation and product approval
 FDA approval process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, warning letters, voluntary product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves the performance of nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical and other nonclinical tests must comply with certain federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, including those encompassing good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements that are meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors, and (ii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time by imposing a clinical hold or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The clinical trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, at each site where a clinical trial will be performed for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or it may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the clinical trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with potentially serious outcome, and confirmation of the result in a second clinical trial would be practically or ethically impossible.

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently $2,038,100 for an NDA with clinical information, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently $97,750 per product and $512,200 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. The FDA seeks to review applications for standard review drug products within ten months, and applications for priority review drugs within six months. Priority review can be applied to drugs intended to treat a serious condition and that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe and effective use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Disclosure of clinical trial information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of these clinical trials after completion if the product candidate is ultimately approved, and disclosure of the results of these clinical trials will be delayed until such approval. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.
 The Hatch-Waxman act
 Orange book listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage 
 15

form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, nonclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement, certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain or carve out any language regarding the patented method-of-use, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
 Exclusivity
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approval an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change.
 An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
 Patent term extension
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent term extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between when the IND becomes effective and NDA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
 For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the PTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 Advertising and promotion
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or certain manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA 
 16

supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures, among other things, must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMP. Regulatory authorities may impose a range of enforcement actions, including bringing a seizure and injunction in court, withdraw product approvals or request voluntary product recalls if a company fails to comply with cGMP requirements.
 Pediatric information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The sponsor must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met, including satisfaction of a pediatric trial as described above. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric clinical trials, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested clinical trials within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 Special protocol assessment
 A company may reach an agreement with FDA under the Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, process as to the required design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. Under the FDC Act and FDA guidance implementing the statutory requirement, an SPA is generally binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy after the clinical trial begins, public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, the sponsor and FDA agree to the change in writing, or if the clinical trial sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. 
 Expedited review and approval
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough designation which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre-NDA meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Priority review, which is requested at the time of NDA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for 
 17

priority review. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs to treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. Discussions with the FDA about the feasibility of an accelerated approval typically begin early in the development of the drug in order to identify, among other things, an appropriate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the appropriateness of the surrogate marker clinical trial.
 Another expedited program is that for Breakthrough Therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). A sponsor may request Breakthrough Therapy designation at the time that the IND is submitted, or no later than at the end-of-Phase 2 meeting. The FDA will respond to a Breakthrough Therapy designation request within sixty days of receipt of the request. A drug that receives Breakthrough Therapy designation is eligible for all fast track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase 1 and commitment from the FDA involving senior managers.
 Regulation of companion diagnostic devices
 If we decide that a diagnostic test would provide useful information for patient selection or if the FDA requires us to develop such a test, we may work with a collaborator to develop an in vitro diagnostic, or companion test. The FDA regulates in vitro diagnostic tests as medical devices, and the type of regulation to which such a test will be subjected will depend, in part, on a risk assessment by the FDA as well as a determination of whether the test is intended to yield results that would be helpful to know versus one that the FDA or we believe is necessary to know for the safe and effective use of our drugs under development.
 The FDA issued Guidance on In-Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices in August 2014, which is intended to assist companies developing in vitro companion diagnostic devices and companies developing therapeutic products that depend on the use of a specific in vitro companion diagnostic for the safe and effective use of the product. The FDA defined an in vitro companion diagnostic device, or IVD companion diagnostic device, as a device that provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. The use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product will be stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product, including the labeling of any generic equivalents of the therapeutic product. The FDA expects that the therapeutic product sponsor will address the need for an approved or cleared IVD companion diagnostic device in its therapeutic product development plan and that, in most cases, the therapeutic product and its corresponding companion diagnostic will be developed contemporaneously.
 Europe/Rest of world government regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company plans to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trials may proceed in that country.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country, even though there is already some degree of legal harmonization in the European Union member states resulting from the national implementation of underlying E.U. legislation. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements.
 To obtain regulatory approval of a new drug, or medicinal product in the European Union sponsor must obtain approval of a marketing authorization application. The way in which a medicinal product can be approved in the European Union depends on the nature of the medicinal product
 The centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the European Union, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated “orphan drugs” (drugs used for rare human diseases) and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, 
 18

such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used for human drugs which do not fall within the above mentioned categories if the human drug (a) contains a new active substance which was not authorized in the European Community; or (b) the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization in the centralized procedure is in the interests of patients or animal health at the European Community level.
 Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the EMA is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP), with adoption of the actual marketing authorization by the European Commission thereafter. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest from the point of view of therapeutic innovation, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated; the absence of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach, and anticipation of exceptional high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150 days and the opinion issued thereafter.
 The mutual recognition procedure, or MRP, for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing authorizations within the European Union. Basically, the MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products, and is based on the principle of recognition of an already existing national marketing authorization by one or more member states.
 The characteristic of the MRP is that the procedure builds on an already existing marketing authorization in a member state of the E.U. that is used as reference in order to obtain marketing authorizations in other E.U. member states. In the MRP, a marketing authorization for a drug already exists in one or more member states of the E.U. and subsequently marketing authorization applications are made in other European Union member states by referring to the initial marketing authorization. The member state in which the marketing authorization was first granted will then act as the reference member state. The member states where the marketing authorization is subsequently applied for act as concerned member states.
 The MRP is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by European Union member states of their respective national marketing authorizations. Based on a marketing authorization in the reference member state, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other member states. In such case, the reference member state shall update its existing assessment report about the drug in 90 days. After the assessment is completed, copies of the report are sent to all member states, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states then have 90 days to recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement.
 Should any Member State refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the issue will be referred to a coordination group. Within a timeframe of 60 days, member states shall, within the coordination group, make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee is then forwarded to the Commission, for the start of the decision-making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human Medicinal Products or Veterinary Medicinal Products, as appropriate.
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
