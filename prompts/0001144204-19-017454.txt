Item 1.   Business. 
Introduction 
 We are a blank check company incorporated on March 28, 2018 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “business combination”). We have reviewed, and continue to review a number of opportunities to enter into a business combination, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a business combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. 
 On July 3, 2018, we consummated our initial public offering (the “initial public offering”) of 28,750,000 units (each, a “unit” and collectively, the “units”), including 3,750,000 units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option in full. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A ordinary shares”), and one-half of one warrant of the Company (the “warrants”), with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $287.5 million. 
 Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale (the “private placement”) of 7,750,000 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) to New Frontier Public Holding Ltd. (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $7,750,000. 
 Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, on April 19, 2018, the Sponsor purchased 10,750,000 Class B ordinary shares of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “founder shares”), which issuance was reflected on the register of members of the company on May 29, 2018 in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share, 5,000,000 of which were issued in connection with the forward purchase agreements (as defined below). In addition, as an inducement to the anchor investors (as defined below) to enter into the forward purchase agreements, on June 19, 2018, the Sponsor transferred to the anchor investors an aggregate of 2,262,500 founder shares for no cash consideration. On June 12, 2018, the Sponsor forfeited 475,000 founder shares to us for no consideration. On June 18, 2018, we effected a share capitalization resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 8,875,000 founder shares after giving effect to the transfer described above. On June 27, 2018, we effected a share capitalization resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 9,450,000 founder shares. Subsequent to the closing of the initial public offering, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 20,000 founder shares to certain of its independent directors (or their designees) in respect of their service on the board of directors.
 Prior to the initial public offering, we entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to which certain accredited investors (the “anchor investors”) agreed to subscribe for an aggregate of 18,100,000 Class A ordinary shares (the “forward purchase shares”) plus 4,525,000 redeemable warrants (the “forward purchase warrants” and, together with the forward purchase shares, the “forward purchase securities”) for a purchase price of $10.00 multiplied by the number of Class A ordinary shares, or $181,000,000 in the aggregate, which aggregate purchase price includes purchases by entities controlled by Antony Leung and Carl Wu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for an aggregate of $21,000,000, in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. In connection with these agreements, the Sponsor transferred to the anchor investors an aggregate of 2,262,500 founder shares as an inducement to enter into the forward purchase agreements for no cash consideration. Subject to 

 1

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 certain exceptions to forfeiture and transfer provisions, the founder shares transferred in connection with these agreements are subject to similar contractual conditions and restrictions as the founder shares issued to the Sponsor in connection with the initial public offering. The forward purchase warrants will have the same terms as our public warrants. Under the terms of the forward purchase agreements, if an anchor investor fails to close on its obligation to purchase forward purchase securities at the time of the initial business combination, such anchor investor will be contractually required to forfeit any and all founder shares transferred to it. 
 We entered into an additional forward purchase agreement as of June 29, 2018, with an accredited investor providing for the purchase of 900,000 forward purchase shares, plus 225,000 forward purchase warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of $9.0 million, or $10.00 per forward purchase share, in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of the initial business combination. As an inducement to such accredited investor to enter into the forward purchase agreement, we will issue an aggregate of 112,500 Class B ordinary shares to the accredited investor for nominal cash consideration upon the completion of the initial business combination. 
 The obligations under the forward purchase agreements do not depend on whether any public shareholders redeem their shares and provide us with a minimum funding level for the initial business combination. 
 A total of $287,500,000, comprised of $283,550,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering (which amount includes $5,600,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount) and $3,950,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in a segregated trust account located in London at Citibank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee (the “trust account”). The amounts held in the trust account are invested in permitted United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, the funds held in the trust account will not be released until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any of the Class A ordinary shares included in the units sold in the initial public offering (the “public shares”) properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of the public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering or (iii) the redemption of the public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering, subject to applicable law. 
 As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $290.46 million in investments and cash held in the trust account and approximately $2.35 million of cash held outside the trust account. As of December 31, 2018, no funds had been withdrawn from the trust account to pay taxes. 
 Effecting our initial business combination 
 General 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering, the private placement and the private placement of the forward purchase shares, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of

 the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination 
 While we may pursue a business combination target in any business or industry, we intend to focus our search for a target with operations or prospects in the healthcare, technology or education sectors in China (the “Chinese new economy sectors”). We will not consummate, directly or indirectly, a business combination with any company in the life sciences sector or with any company that principally owns real estate that is not incidental to its conduct of an operating business. We believe that China is entering a new era of economic growth, particularly in the Chinese new economy sectors, which we expect will result in attractive initial business combination opportunities for us. We believe this growth will be driven by private sector expansion, technological innovation, increasing consumption by the middle class, structural economic and policy reforms and demographic changes in China. We will not effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
 New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses or assets, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make such independent determination of fair market value, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target operating businesses or assets meet the 80% of assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of NYSE’s 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with the Sponsor or our officers or directors or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with the Sponsor or our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with the Sponsor or our executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 Redemption rights for holders of public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to certain limitations. The amount in the trust account initially was $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with respect to our initial shareholders other than the anchor investors, public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by the Sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them. 
 Submission of our initial business combination to a shareholder vote 
 In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 
 If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial shareholders (other than the anchor investors) have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after the initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. The anchor investors have agreed to vote their founder shares in favor of our initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with respect to our initial shareholders other than the anchor investors, public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by the Sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them.

 Conduct of redemptions pursuant to tender offer rules 
 If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
 Limitation on redemption rights upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek shareholder approval 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the public shares without our prior consent, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the public shares could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, the Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20% of the public shares without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. 
 Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we will have until July 3, 2020 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by July 3, 2020, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by July 3, 2020. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than

 us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
Employees 
 We currently have three executive officers and four other officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 
Available Information 
 We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request from us in writing at 23rd Floor, 299 QRC, 287-299 Queen’s Road Central, Hong Kong or by telephone at (852) 3703-3251.
