Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

General 
 Riverview Financial Corporation (the Company) was formed in 2013 as a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania. The Company provides a full range of financial services through its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Riverview Bank (the Bank), which is its sole operating segment. The Company has approximately 310 employees. 
 The Bank is a state-chartered bank and trust company regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (DOB) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) that offers financial services through 28 community banking offices and four limited purpose offices. 
 Effective October 1, 2017, the Company merged with CBT Financial Corp. (CBT) and its subsidiary, CBT Bank, merged with and into the Bank. The Companys financial results reflect the merger of CBT Bank and the Bank under the purchase method of accounting, with the Company treated as the acquirer from an accounting standpoint. 
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references in this annual report to the Company, Bank, we, us and our refer to Riverview Financial Corporation, its direct and indirect subsidiaries and its and their respective predecessors. 
 We primarily generate income through interest income derived from our loan and securities portfolios. Other income is generated primarily from transaction fees, trust and wealth management fees, mortgage banking fees and service charges on deposit accounts. Our primary costs are interest paid on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses. We provide a variety of commercial and retail banking and financial services to businesses, non-profit organizations, governmental and municipal agencies, professional customers, and retail customers, on a personalized basis. 
 Market Areas 
 The Banks market area consists of Berks, Blair, Centre, Clearfield, Dauphin, Huntingdon, Lebanon, Lycoming, Northumberland, Perry, Schuylkill and Somerset Counties in Central Pennsylvania. 
 Products and Services 
 The Bank offers a variety of consumer and commercial banking products and services throughout its market area. Our primary lending products are real estate, commercial and consumer loans. Our primary deposit products are NOW, demand deposit accounts, and certificate of deposit accounts. We also offer ATM access, investment accounts, trust department services and other various lending, depository and related financial services. 
Lending Activities 
 We provide a full range of retail and commercial lending products designed to meet the borrowing needs of consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses in our market area. A significant amount of our loans are made to customers located within our market area. We have no foreign loans or highly leveraged transaction loans, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Although we participate in loans originated by other banks, we have originated the majority of the loans in our portfolio. 
 Our primary commercial products are loans to small- and medium- sized businesses. Our consumer products include one-to-four family residential mortgages, consumer, automobile, home equity, educational and lines of credit loans. Our retail lending products include the following types of loans, among others: residential real estate; automobiles; manufactured housing; personal; student; and home equity. Our commercial lending products include the following types of loans, among others: commercial real estate; working capital; equipment and other commercial needs; construction; and agricultural and mineral rights. The terms offered on a loan vary depending on the type of loan and credit-worthiness of the borrower. We fund our loans, primarily, from our various deposit products which include certificates of deposits, savings, money market and various demand deposit accounts that are offered to both consumer and commercial customers. 
 Payment risk is a function of the economic climate in which our lending activities are conducted. Economic downturns in the economy generally, or in a particular sector, could cause cash flow problems for our customers, impairing their ability to repay loans we make to them. We attempt to minimize this risk by avoiding loan concentrations to a single customer or a group of similar customer types, the loss of any one or more of whom would have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition. One element of interest rate risk arises from making fixed rate loans in an environment of changing interest rates. We attempt to mitigate this risk by making adjustable rate loans and by limiting repricing terms to five years or less for commercial customers requiring fixed rate loans.

 Our lending activity also exposes us to the risk that any collateral we take as security is not adequate. We attempt to manage collateral risk by avoiding loan concentrations to particular types of borrowers, by perfecting liens on collateral and by obtaining appraisals on property prior to extending loans. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to these and other types of lending risks by stratifying authorization requirements by loan size and complexity. 
 We are not dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of one or more of which would have a materially adverse effect on our operations. In the ordinary course of our business, our operations and earnings are not materially affected by seasonal changes or by Federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations. 
 We intend to continue to evaluate commercial real estate, commercial business and governmental lending opportunities, including small business lending. We continue to proactively monitor and manage existing credit relationships. 
 We have not engaged in sub-prime residential mortgage lending, which is defined as mortgage loans advanced to borrowers who do not qualify for market interest rates because of problems with their credit history. We focus our lending efforts within our market area. 
 Deposit Activities 
 Our primary source of funds is the cash flow provided by our financing activities, mainly deposit gathering. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms, including, among others: money market accounts; NOW accounts; savings accounts; certificates of deposit; individual retirement accounts, and demand deposit accounts. These deposits are primarily obtained from areas surrounding our branch offices. We rely primarily on marketing, product innovation, technology, service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits. Other deposit related services include: remote deposit capture; automatic clearing house transactions; cash management services; automated teller machines; point of sale transactions; safe deposit boxes; night depository services; direct deposit; and official check services. 
Trust, Wealth Management and Brokerage Services 
 Through our trust department, we offer a broad range of fiduciary and investment services. Our trust and investment services include: 
 

 | investment management;
--+-----------------------


 | IRA trustee services;
--+----------------------


 | estate administration;
--+-----------------------


 | living trusts;
--+---------------


 | trustee under will;
--+--------------------


 | guardianships;
--+---------------


 | life insurance trusts;
--+-----------------------


 | custodial services / IRA custodial services;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | corporate trusts; and
--+----------------------


 | pension and profit sharing plans.
--+----------------------------------

 We provide a comprehensive array of wealth management products and services through Riverview Wealth Management and Trust Management divisions to individuals, small businesses and nonprofit entities. These products and services include the following, among others: investment portfolio management; brokerage; estate planning assistance; annuities; business succession planning; insurance; education funding strategies; and tax planning assistance. 
 We have a third-party marketing agreement with a broker-dealer that allows us to offer a full range of securities, brokerage services and annuity sales to our customers. We have three dedicated locations that provide such investor services as well as accommodating customer meetings by appointment within our retail banking offices. Through these divisions, our clients have access to a wide array of financial products including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, annuities and insurance. 
 Competition 
 The banking and financial services industries are highly competitive. Within its geographic region, the Bank faces direct competition from other commercial banks, varying in size from local community banks to larger regional and nationwide banks, credit unions and non-bank entities. As a result of the wide availability of electronic delivery channels, the Bank also faces competition from financial institutions that do not have a physical presence in its geographic markets. 
 
-4- 


 Many of our competitors are substantially larger in terms of assets and available resources. Certain of these institutions have significantly higher lending limits than we do and may provide various services to their customers that we presently do not. In addition, we experience competition for deposits from mutual funds and broker dealers, while consumer discount, mortgage and insurance companies compete with us for various types of loans. Credit unions, finance companies and mortgage companies enjoy certain competitive advantages over us, as they are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions and taxation as commercial banks. Principal methods of competing for bank products, permitted nonbanking services and financial activities include price, nature of product, quality of service, convenience of location, and availability of banking convenience technology, including telephone and web-based banking services. 
 In our market area, interest rates on deposits, especially time deposits, and interest rates and fees charged to customers on loans are very competitive. In the current economic environment, we are experiencing increased competition in view of our loan demand and deposit gathering. 
 We believe that our most significant competitive advantage originates from our business philosophy, which includes offering direct access to senior management and other officers, providing friendly, informed and courteous service, local and timely decision making, flexible and reasonable operating procedures, and consistently applied credit policies. In addition, our success has been, and will continue to be, a result of our emphasis on community involvement and customer relationships. With consolidation continuing in the financial industry, and particularly in our market area, smaller community banks like us are gaining opportunities to increase market share as larger institutions reduce their emphasis on, or exit, the markets. 
 Seasonality 
 Generally, our operations are not seasonal in nature. Our deposit activities, however, have been somewhat influenced by fiscal funding appropriations related to municipalities and school districts in our market areas, which are to some extent seasonal in nature. 
Supervision and Regulation 
 We are extensively regulated under federal and state laws. Generally, these laws and regulations are intended to protect consumers, not shareholders. The following is a summary description of certain provisions of law that affect the regulation of bank holding companies and banks. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. Changes in laws and regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects. 
 The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the BHCA and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) or (FRB). We are required to file annual and quarterly reports with the FRB and to provide the FRB with such additional information as the FRB may require. The FRB also conducts periodic examinations of the Company. In addition, under the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (DOB), has the authority to examine the books, records and affairs of the Company and to require any documentation deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the Pennsylvania Banking Code. 
 With certain limited exceptions, we are required to obtain prior approval from the FRB before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any voting securities or substantially all assets of a bank or bank holding company, or before merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. Additionally, with certain exceptions, any person or entity proposing to acquire control through direct or indirect ownership of 25% or more of our voting securities is required to give 60 days written notice of the acquisition to the FRB, which may prohibit the transaction, and to publish notice to the public. 
 The Bank is primarily regulated by the DOB and the FDIC. The DOB may prohibit an institution, over which it has supervisory authority, from engaging in activities or investments that the agency believes constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. Federal banking regulators have extensive enforcement authority over the institutions they regulate to prohibit or correct activities that violate law, regulation or a regulatory agreement or which are deemed to constitute unsafe or unsound practices. 
 Enforcement actions may include: 
 

 | the appointment of a conservator or receiver;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | the issuance of a cease and desist order;
--+------------------------------------------


 | the termination of deposit insurance, the imposition of civil money penalties on the institution, its directors, officers, employees and institution affiliated parties;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the issuance of directives to increase capital;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | the issuance of formal and informal agreements and orders;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 
-5- 


 
 | the removal of or restrictions on directors, officers, employees and institution-affiliated parties; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the enforcement of any such mechanisms through restraining orders or any other court actions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or any related interests of such persons which generally require that such credit extensions be made on substantially the same terms as are available to third parties dealing with us, and do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Other laws limit the maximum amount that we may loan to any one customer as a percentage of our capital levels. 
 Permitted Non-Banking Activities 
 Generally, a bank holding company may not engage in any activities other than banking, managing or controlling its bank and other authorized subsidiaries, or providing service to those subsidiaries. With prior approval of the FRB, we may acquire more than 5% of the assets or outstanding shares of a company engaging in non-bank activities determined by the FRB to be closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks. The FRB provides expedited procedures for expansion into approved categories of non-bank activities. 
 Limitations on Dividends and Other Payments and Transactions 
 Our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from the Bank. The Company relies on dividends from the Bank for its own ability to pay dividends to shareholders. Both federal and state laws impose restrictions on the ability of both the Company and the Bank to pay dividends. 
Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) 
 Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain quantitative and qualitative restrictions on extensions of credit to the bank holding company or its subsidiaries, and on the use of their securities as collateral for loans. These regulations and restrictions may limit the Companys ability to obtain funds from the Bank for its cash needs, including funds for the payment of dividends, interest and operating expenses. Further, subject to certain exceptions, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements relating to any extension of credit, the lease or sale of property, or furnishing of services. 
 Under longstanding FRB policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank, and the FRB may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank when required. A required capital injection may be called for at a time when the holding company does not have the resources to provide it. In addition, depository institutions insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any losses incurred, or reasonably anticipated to be incurred, in connection with the default of or assistance provided to a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution. Accordingly, in the event any insured subsidiary of a bank holding company causes a loss to the FDIC, other insured subsidiaries of a bank holding company could be required to compensate the FDIC by reimbursing it for the estimated amount of such loss. Such cross-guarantee liabilities generally are superior in priority to the obligation of the depository institutions to its shareholders, due solely to their status as shareholders, and obligations to other affiliates. 
 Pennsylvania Law 
 As a Pennsylvania bank holding company, the Company is subject to various restrictions on its activities as set forth in Pennsylvania law. This is in addition to those restrictions set forth in federal law. Under Pennsylvania law, a bank holding company that desires to acquire a bank or bank holding company that has its principal place of business in Pennsylvania must obtain permission from the DOB. 
Financial Institution Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) 
 FIRREA was enacted to address the financial condition of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, to restructure the regulation of the thrift industry, and to enhance the supervisory and enforcement powers of the federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies. As the primary federal regulator of the Bank, the FDIC, in conjunction with the DOB, is responsible for its supervision. When dealing with capital requirements, those regulatory bodies have the flexibility to impose supervisory agreements on institutions that fail to comply with regulatory requirements. The imposition of a capital plan, termination of deposit insurance, and removal or temporary suspension of an officer, director or other institution-affiliated person may cause enforcement actions. 
 
-6- 


 There are three levels of civil penalties under FIRREA: 
 

 | The first tier provides for civil penalties of up to $5,500 per day for any violation of law or regulation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The second tier provides for civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day if more than a minimal loss or a pattern is involved; and.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Finally, civil penalties of up to the lesser of $1.1 million or 1% of total assets per day may be assessed for knowingly or recklessly causing a substantial loss to an institution or taking action that results in a substantial pecuniary gain or other benefit.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Criminal penalties are increased to $1.1 million per violation and may be up to $5.5 million for continuing violations or for the actual amount of gain or loss. These penalties may be combined with prison sentences of up to five years. These penalties are subject to adjustment in accordance with inflation adjustment procedures prescribed under applicable law. 
 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) 
 FDICIA provides for, among other things: 
 

 | publicly available annual financial condition and management reports for financial institutions, including audits by independent accountants;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the establishment of uniform accounting standards by federal banking agencies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the establishment of a prompt corrective action system of regulatory supervision and intervention, based on capitalization levels, with more scrutiny and restrictions placed on depository institutions with lower levels of capital;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | additional grounds for the appointment of a conservator or receiver; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | restrictions or prohibitions on accepting brokered deposits, except for institutions which significantly exceed minimum capital requirements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A central feature of FDICIA is the requirement that the federal banking agencies take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Pursuant to FDICIA, the federal bank regulatory authorities have adopted regulations setting forth a five-tiered system for measuring the capital adequacy of the depository institutions that they supervise. Under these regulations, a depository institution is classified in one of the following capital categories: 
 

 | well capitalized;
--+--------------------


 | adequately capitalized;
--+--------------------------


 | under capitalized;
--+---------------------


 | significantly undercapitalized; and
--+--------------------------------------


 | critically undercapitalized.
--+-------------------------------

 The Bank was categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action at December 31, 2018, based on the most recent notification from the FDIC. An institution may be deemed by the regulators to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if, among other things, it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to asset quality, management, earnings or liquidity. 
 Beginning January 1, 2015, all insured depository institutions are required to incorporate the revised regulatory capital requirements, discussed below under the heading Risk Based Capital Requirements, into the prompt corrective action framework, including the new common equity tier 1 capital asset ratio and a higher tier 1 risk-based capital ratio. 
 FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions, including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fees to its holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of other requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized and requirements to reduce total assets and stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator generally within 90 days of the date such institution is determined to be critically undercapitalized. 
 FDICIA provides the federal banking agencies with significantly expanded powers to take enforcement action against institutions that fail to comply with capital or other standards. Such actions may include the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC or the appointment of a receiver or conservator for the institution. FDICIA also limits the circumstances under which the FDIC is permitted to provide financial assistance to an insured institution before appointment of a conservator or receiver.

 Under FDICIA, as amended by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. Any institution that fails to meet these standards may be required to develop an acceptable plan, specifying the steps that the institutions will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In July 2010, the federal banking agencies issued Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies (Guidance) that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the agencies, thereby including both the Company and the Bank. Pursuant to the Guidance, to be consistent with safety and soundness principles, a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should: provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward; be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the banking organizations board of directors. Monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation. Specific regulatory requirements regarding incentive compensation are discussed in the section titled Dodd-Frank Act. 
 Risk-Based Capital Requirements 
 The federal banking regulators have adopted certain risk-based capital guidelines to assist in assessing capital adequacy of a banking organizations operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse agreements, which are recorded as off-balance sheet items. Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit-equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain US Treasury securities, to 100% for assets with relatively high credit risk, such as business loans. 
 A banking organizations risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets. The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets, which include off-balance-sheet items, against both total qualifying capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and Tier 1 capital. 
 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital includes common equity and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other intangibles, subject to certain exceptions and retained earnings. 
 Tier 1, or core capital, includes common equity, non-cumulative preferred stock and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other intangibles, subject to certain exceptions. 
 Tier 2, or supplementary capital, includes, among other things, limited life preferred stock, hybrid capital instruments, mandatory convertible securities, qualifying subordinated debt, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations less restricted deductions. The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies. 
 In July 2013, the federal banking agencies issued final rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The phase-in period for community banking organizations began January 1, 2015, while larger institutions (generally those with assets of $250 billion or more) began compliance on January 1, 2014. The final rules call for the following capital requirements: 
 A minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%. 
 A minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%. 
 A minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. 
 A minimum leverage ratio of 4%. 
 In addition, the final rules establish a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets applicable to all banking organizations. If a banking organization fails to hold capital above the minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, it will be subject to certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executives. The phase-in period for the capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers for all banking organizations began on January 1, 2016, with final phase in to be completed by January 1, 2019. 
 
-8- 


 Under the proposed rules, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) would have been included in a banking organizations common equity tier 1 capital. The final rules allow community banks to make a one-time election not to include these additional components of AOCI in regulatory capital and instead use the existing treatment under the general risk-based capital rules that excludes most AOCI components from regulatory capital. The opt-out election was required to be made in the first call report or FR Y-9 series report that is filed after the financial institution becomes subject to the final rule. The Bank opted-out of the inclusion of the components of AOCI in regulatory capital. 
 Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the new rules replace the ratings-based approach to securitization exposures, which is based on external credit ratings, with the simplified supervisory formula approach in order to determine the appropriate risk weights for these exposures. Alternatively, banking organizations may use the existing gross-up approach to assign securitization exposures to a risk weight category or choose to assign such exposures a 1,250 percent risk weight. 
 Under the new rules, mortgage servicing assets (MSAs) and certain deferred tax assets (DTAs) are subject to stricter limitations than those applicable under the current general risk-based capital rule. The new rules also increase the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors. 
 Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject a banking organization to a variety of enforcement actions including: 
 

 | limitations on its ability to pay dividends;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | the issuance by the applicable regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital, and in the case of depository institutions, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, as well as to the measures described under FDICIA as applicable to undercapitalized institutions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, future changes in regulations or practices could further reduce the amount of capital recognized for purposes of capital adequacy. Such a change could affect the ability of the Bank to grow and could restrict the amount of profits, if any, available for the payment of dividends to the Company. 
 At December 31, 2018, the Bank was well capitalized under the foregoing requirements with a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.7%, tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 8.4%, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.7% and a total capital ratio of 11.4%. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Regulatory agencies include in their evaluations of a banks capital adequacy, an assessment of the banks interest rate risk exposure. The standards for measuring the adequacy and effectiveness of a banking organizations interest rate risk management includes a measurement of board of directors and senior management oversight, and a determination of whether a banking organizations procedures for comprehensive risk management are appropriate to the circumstances of the specific banking organization. We utilize internal interest rate risk models to measure and monitor interest rate risk. Finally, regulatory agencies, as part of the scope of their periodic examinations, evaluate our interest rate risk. 
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) 
 Under the CRA, the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to ascertain and meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income areas. CRA is designed to create a system for bank regulatory agencies to evaluate a depository institutions record in meeting the credit needs of its community. CRA regulations were completely revised as of July 1, 1995, to establish performance-based standards for use in examining for compliance. Assessment by bank regulators of CRA compliance focuses on three tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institutions record of making loans, including community development loans, in its designated assessment areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institutions record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and areas and small businesses; and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institutions delivery of banking services throughout its CRA assessment area, including low and moderate income areas. The Bank had its last completed CRA compliance examination conducted January 30, 2017 and received a satisfactory rating. 
Bank Secrecy Act, USA Patriot Act of 2001 (Patriot Act), and Related Rules and Regulations 
 The Patriot Act contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and imposes various regulations, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Among other requirements, the Patriot Act and the related regulations impose the following requirements with respect to financial institutions: 

 | Establishment of anti-money laundering programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------

 
-9- 


 
 | Establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Establishment of enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Prohibition on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with recordkeeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with the Patriot Acts requirements could have serious legal, financial, regulatory and reputational consequences. In addition, bank regulators will consider a holding companys effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on BHCA and Bank Merger Act applications. 
 In May 2018, a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network rule requiring banks to implement strengthened customer due diligence requirements took effect. Among other requirements, the rules contain explicit customer due diligence requirements and require banks to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. 
 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) 
 In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act became law. Dodd-Frank is intended to effect a fundamental restructuring of federal banking regulation. Among other things, Dodd-Frank created the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify systemic risks in the financial system and gave federal regulators the authority to take control of and liquidate financial firms. Dodd-Frank additionally created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent federal regulator that administers federal consumer protection laws. Dodd-Frank has and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on our business operations as its provisions take effect. It is expected that, as various implementing rules and regulations continue to be released, they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense. Among the provisions that affect us or are likely to affect us are the following: 
Volker Rule 
 As mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, in December 2013, the OCC, FRB, FDIC, SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued a final rule (the Final Rules) implementing certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and non-bank financial company supervised by the FRB to engage in proprietary trading and have certain ownership interests in, or relationships with, a covered fund (the Volker Rule). On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA) was signed into law. Among other relief, the EGRRCPA exempts banking organizations with $10 billion or less in total consolidated assets, and total trading assets and trading liabilities that are 5% or less of total consolidated assets, from the Volcker Rule. 
 Incentive-Based Compensation 
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires, in part, that the federal banking agencies and the SEC establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities that encourage inappropriate risk-taking by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The federal banking agencies issued such proposed rules in April 2011 and issued a revised proposed rule in June 2016, implementing these requirements and prohibitions. The revised proposed rule would apply to all banks, among other institutions, with at least $1 billion in average total consolidated assets, for which it would go beyond the existing Guidance to (i) prohibit certain types and features of incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive officers, (ii) require incentive-based compensation arrangements to adhere to certain basic principles to avoid a presumption of encouraging inappropriate risk, (iii) require appropriate board or committee oversight and (iv) establish minimum recordkeeping and (v) mandate disclosures to the appropriate federal banking agency. The Company believes that it meets substantially all the standards that have been adopted. 
 Holding Company Capital Requirements 
 Dodd-Frank requires the FRB to apply consolidated capital requirements to bank holding companies that are no less stringent than those currently applied to depository institutions. Under these standards, trust preferred securities will be excluded from Tier 1 capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010, by a bank holding company with less than $15 billion in assets. Dodd-Frank additionally requires that bank regulators issue countercyclical capital requirements so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion are consistent with safety and soundness. EGRRCPA also requires the federal banking agencies to adopt a community bank leverage ratio of 8% to 10%, for qualifying banking organizations with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Such institutions that satisfy the community bank leverage ratio would be deemed to satisfy generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements, and to have the capital ratios that are required to be considered well capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework. Additionally, the EGRRCPA amends the federal banking agencies regulatory capital rules to narrow the definition of high volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) loans, which receive a higher risk weighting than other commercial real estate loans under risk-based capital requirements.

 Deposit Insurance 
 Dodd-Frank permanently increases the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. Substantially all deposits of the Bank are insured up to that limit. Dodd-Frank also broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. Dodd-Frank requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020 and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio reaches 1.50% of insured deposits. In lieu of the dividend payments, the FDIC has adopted progressively lower assessment rate schedules that become effective when the reserve ratio exceeds 2.0% and 2.5%. In setting the assessment rates necessary to meet the new 1.35% requirement, the FDIC is required to offset the effect of this provision on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, so that more of the cost of raising the reserve ratio will be borne by the institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the DIF reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020. Additionally, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, disallows the deduction of FDIC insurance premiums for tax purposes, effective January 1, 2018, where previously, FDIC insurance premiums were fully deductible for tax purposes. 
 The FDIC annually establishes for the DIF a designated reserve ratio, or DRR, of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC announced that the DRR for 2018 will remain at 2.00%, which is the same ratio that has been in effect since January 1, 2011. The FDIC is authorized to change deposit insurance assessment rates as necessary to maintain the DRR, without further notice-and-comment rulemaking, provided that: (i) no such adjustment can be greater than three basis points from one quarter to the next, (ii) adjustments cannot result in rates more than three basis points above or below the base rates and (iii) rates cannot be negative. On October 22, 2015, the FDIC issued a proposal to increase the reserve ratio for the DIF to the minimum level of 1.35%. The FDIC adopted the final rule on March 15, 2016, which imposes on insured depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets, a quarterly surcharge equal to an annual rate of 4.5 basis points applied to the deposit insurance assessment base, after making certain adjustments. The rule became effective on July 1, 2016. 
 Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has backup enforcement authority over a depository institution holding company, such as the Company, if the conduct or threatened conduct of such holding company poses a risk to the DIF, although such authority may not be used if the holding company is generally in sound condition and does not pose a foreseeable and material risk to the DIF. 
 Corporate Governance 
 Dodd-Frank requires publicly-traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at least every three years, a non-binding vote regarding the frequency of the vote on executive compensation at least every six years, and a non-binding vote on golden parachute payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions unless previously voted on by stockholders. Additionally, Dodd-Frank directs the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1.0 billion, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded. Dodd-Frank also gives the SEC authority to prohibit broker discretionary voting on elections of directors and executive compensation matters. 
Prohibition Against Charter Conversions of Troubled Institutions 
 Dodd-Frank prohibits a depository institution from converting from a state to a federal charter, or vice versa, while it is the subject of a cease and desist order or other formal enforcement action or a memorandum of understanding with respect to a significant supervisory matter unless the appropriate federal banking agency gives notice of the conversion to the federal or state authority that issued the enforcement action and that agency does not object within 30 days. The notice must include a plan to address the significant supervisory matters. The converting institution must also file a copy of the conversion application with its current federal regulator, which must notify the resulting federal regulator of any ongoing supervisory or investigative proceedings that are likely to result in an enforcement action and provide access to all supervisory and investigative information relating thereto. 
Interstate Branching 
 Dodd-Frank authorizes national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted. Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state. Accordingly, banks are able to enter new markets more freely.

 Limits on Interstate Acquisitions and Mergers 
 Dodd-Frank precludes a bank holding company from engaging in an interstate acquisitionthe acquisition of a bank outside its home stateunless the bank holding company is both well capitalized and well managed. Furthermore, a bank may not engage in an interstate merger with a bank headquartered in another state unless the surviving institution will be well capitalized and well managed. The previous standard in both cases was adequately capitalized and adequately managed. 
Limits on Interchange Fees 
 Dodd-Frank amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to give the Federal Reserve the authority, among other things, to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and to enforce a statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer. The Federal Reserve issued its final rule, Regulation II, effective October 1, 2011. Consistent with Dodd-Frank, issuers with less than $10 billion in assets, like the Company, are exempt from debit card interchange fee standards. 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
 Dodd-Frank created the CFPB, which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, TILA, RESPA, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. Dodd-Frank authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrowers ability to repay. In addition, Dodd-Frank allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a qualified mortgage as defined by the CFPB. Dodd-Frank permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. 
Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule 
 Pursuant to the Dodd Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a final rule on January 10, 2013, which became effective January 10, 2014, amending Regulation Z as implemented by the Truth in Lending Act, requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: 

 | current or reasonably expected income or assets;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | current employment status;
--+---------------------------


 | the monthly payment on the covered transaction;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations;
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | current debt obligations, alimony, and child support;
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | credit history.
--+----------------

 Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate qualified mortgages, which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a qualified mortgage is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage, the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Loans which meet these criteria will be considered qualified mortgages, and as a result will generally protect lenders from fines or litigation in the event of foreclosure. Qualified mortgages that are higher-priced (e.g. subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not higher-priced (e.g. prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. The final rule, as issued, is not expected to have a material impact on our lending activities or our results of operations or financial condition.

 TILA/RESPA Integrated Disclosures (TRID) 
 On October 3, 2015, the CFPB implemented a final rule combining the mortgage disclosures consumers previously received under TILA and RESPA. For more than 30 years, the TILA and RESPA mortgage disclosures had been administered separately by, respectively, the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The final rule requires lenders to provide applicants with the new Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure and generally applies to most closed-end consumer mortgage loans for which the creditor or mortgage broker receives an application on or after October 3, 2015. 
 Consumer Lending Laws 
 Bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on consumer protection laws and regulations. To promote fairness and transparency for mortgages, credit cards, and other consumer financial products and services, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB. This agency is responsible for interpreting and enforcing federal consumer financial laws, as defined by the Dodd-Frank Act, that, among other things, govern the provision of deposit accounts along with mortgage origination and servicing. Some federal consumer financial laws enforced by the CFPB include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, TILA, the Truth in Savings Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, RESPA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The CFPB is also authorized to prevent any institution under its authority from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services. As a residential mortgage lender, the Company and the Bank are subject to multiple federal consumer protection statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, TILA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, RESPA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Act and the Flood Disaster Protection Act. Failure to comply with these and similar statutes and regulations can result in the Company and the Bank becoming subject to formal or informal enforcement actions, the imposition of civil money penalties, and consumer litigation. 
Commercial Real Estate Guidance 
 In December 2015, the federal banking agencies released a statement entitled Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending (the CRE Statement). In the CRE Statement, the agencies express concerns with institutions that ease commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that they will continue to pay special attention to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. The agencies previously issued guidance in December 2006, entitled Interagency Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices, which states that an institution is potentially exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk, and should employ enhanced risk management practices, where total commercial real estate loans represents 300% or more of its total capital and the outstanding balance of such institutions commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months. 
Privacy Protection and Cybersecurity 
 The Bank is subject to regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the GLB Act. These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares nonpublic personal information, to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. The regulations also require the Bank to provide its customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect its privacy policies and practices. In addition, to the extent its sharing of such information is not covered by an exception, the Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt-out of having the Bank share their nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third parties. 
 The Bank is subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. These regulations implement certain provisions of the GLB Act. The guidelines describe the federal bank regulatory agencies expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services. In October 2016, the federal banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards that would apply to large and interconnected banking organizations and to services provided by third parties to these firms. These enhanced standards would apply only to depository institutions and depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more.

 Federal Reserve System 
 FRB regulations require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and demand deposit accounts). A reserve of 3% is to be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts between $16.0 million and $122.3 million (subject to adjustment by the FRB) plus a reserve of 10% (subject to adjustment by the FRB between 8% and 14%) against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of $122.3 million. The first $16.0 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustment by the FRB) is exempt from the reserve requirements. The Bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements. 
 Required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash, an account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB. Pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the Federal Reserve Banks pay interest on depository institution required and excess reserve balances. The interest rate paid on required reserve balances is currently the average target federal funds rate over the reserve maintenance period. The rate on excess balances will be set equal to the lowest target federal funds rate in effect during the reserve maintenance period. 
 Future Legislation 
 Proposed legislation is introduced in almost every legislative session that would dramatically affect the regulation of the banking industry. We cannot predict if any such legislation will be adopted nor if adopted how it would affect our business. History has demonstrated that new legislation or changes to existing laws or regulations usually results in greater compliance burden and therefore generally increases the cost of doing business. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 310 employees. We are not parties to any collective bargaining agreements and we consider our employee relations to be good. 
 Availability of Securities Filings 
 Effective February 11, 2015, the Company became a reporting company and was required to file certain periodic reports under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as required by Section 15(d) of that act. Effective August 10, 2018, the Company registered its stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and thereby became required to file certain additional periodic reports under the Exchange Act. We file the required annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. 
 In addition, we maintain an Internet website at www.riverviewbankpa.com. We make available, free of charge, through the Investor Relations link on our Internet website, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
