ITEM 1. BUSINESS


OVERVIEW
We are a global life sciences company focused on providing innovative preparedness and response solutions addressing accidental, deliberate and naturally occurring public health threats (PHTs). Our solutions include a product portfolio, a product development portfolio, and a CDMO services portfolio. The types of PHTs we are currently addressing are focused on the following five categories:
•chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives (CBRNE); 
•emerging infectious diseases (EID); 
•travel health; 
•public health crises (such as the opioid crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic); and 
•acute, emergency, and community care. 
Our revenues are derived from a combination of the sale and procurement of our product/product candidate portfolio (described below), the provision of our CDMO services to external customers, and the securing of non-dilutive contract and grant funding for research and development (R&D) projects by us from various third-party sources.
OUR BUSINESS LINES
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our operating structure such that we now operate under three separate business lines, each focused on distinct customer or market types. These three business lines are:
•the Government - Medical Countermeasures (MCM) business line;
•the Commercial business line; and
•the Services - CDMO business line.
In connection with the reorganization, we also centralized our R&D organization and established an enterprise-wide governance approach to managing our portfolio of R&D projects.
Government - MCM Business Line
Our Government - MCM business line focuses primarily on procurement of MCM products and procured product candidates by domestic and international government customers, with an emphasis on the USG, who is our largest customer. We also sell MCM products and procured product candidates to domestic and international non-government organizations and governments outside of the United States.
Commercial Business Line
Our Commercial business line primarily focuses on sales of NARCAN®(naloxone HCI) Nasal Spray and our travelers' vaccines. NARCAN® is sold commercially through physician-directed or standing order prescriptions at retail pharmacies and to state and local governments and first responders including police, firefighters and emergency medical teams. Our travelers' vaccines include Vaxchora® and Vivotif®, which are approved for use in the United States and other territories, and are sold primarily to private travel clinics, retail pharmacies and integrated hospital networks. 
Services - CDMO Business Line
Our portfolio of CDMO services consists of three distinct but interrelated service pillars: development services (process and analytical development); drug substance manufacturing; and drug product manufacturing (fill/finish). These services, which we collectively refer to as a “molecule-to-market” offering, employ diverse technology platforms (mammalian, microbial, viral and plasma across a network of development and manufacturing sites operated by us. These CDMO services support all phases of the drug development life cycle, from pre-clinical development programs through commercial manufacturing of approved pharmaceutical products. The customer base for CDMO services is primarily innovators in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical segments, but also includes government sponsored entities as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 
OUR STRATEGY
Our ongoing five-year strategic plan, 2020-2024, is focused on leveraging core competencies, relationships and operating systems we have developed over the last 23 years and driving growth across various segments of the PHT market. The strategic plan specifies employing five core strategies. They are: 
Execute Core Business — We are focused on continuing to build our leadership positions across several markets in the PHT space. These include, but are not limited to, MCMs, opioid rescue and travel health. Additionally, our Core Business includes our growing CDMO services. We believe our diversified portfolio of products and services, combined with our quality development and manufacturing services across a spectrum of differentiated and complex manufacturing processes position us for continued growth across the PHT landscape. Additionally, we will continue to leverage our specialized government relations and contracting operations to negotiate long-term, profitable procurement and development agreements that enable us to protect and enhance lives around the world and that help ensure sustainability of our business. 
Grow Through Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) — We have successfully executed and integrated several product and facility acquisitions that have increased our diversification, allowed expansion into new markets, and provided a differentiated R&D pipeline. We plan to continue to leverage our M&A and partnering strengths not only to solidify our leadership positions in the MCM market, but also to expand our businesses in PHT markets where the government is not the primary customer. We aim to accomplish this goal through a disciplined approach to acquiring accretive or clinical-stage assets and to forming partnerships that help us to achieve our strategic objectives. 
Strengthen R&D Portfolio — We continue to focus on expanding and advancing our pipeline of vaccines and therapeutic product candidates, with the aim of developing differentiated products that address unmet needs in the PHT space. We fund our pipeline by investing our own funds and through securing government contracts, grants, or other non-dilutive funding. We plan to grow our R&D pipeline to expand our portfolio of marketed and procured PHT products.
Build Scalable Capabilities — Achieving our 2024 strategic objectives requires an investment in infrastructure, internal governance and capabilities that help us realize the benefits of scale. This includes investing new capital into our development and manufacturing facilities, strengthening our global sales and procurement models, upgrading our technology and growing our commercial infrastructure. These, and other capabilities, are intended to help us operate in a more efficient, customer-focused manner, while better serving both government and non-government customers. 
Evolve the Culture --- We are proud of our heritage and the organization we have built, and further believe that the growth we are striving for requires continued improvement and refinement of the culture of the organization. We anticipate continuing to invest in the development of our people and our culture consistent with our values. We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent reflecting a diversity of ideas, backgrounds, and perspectives and seek to demonstrate that commitment through our talent development strategy, processes and company-wide programs.
Assuming successful execution of this strategic plan, we anticipate total revenue in 2024 of at least $2 billion and an adjusted EBITDA margin1 in 2024 of 27-30%.
1 Adjusted EBITDA Margin is equal to Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict or to reflect the non-cash impact of charges or accounting changes.

Description of MCM Products
ACAM2000®. ACAM2000 is a smallpox vaccine licensed by the FDA and is the primary smallpox vaccine designated for use in a bioterrorism emergency. ACAM2000 is also licensed in Australia and Singapore and is currently stockpiled both in the United States and internationally. Smallpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the Variola virus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is one of the most devastating diseases with a mortality rate as high as 30%. The vaccine stimulates a person's immune system to develop antibodies and cells in the blood and elsewhere that can then help the body fight off a smallpox infection if exposure to smallpox occurs.
On September 3, 2019, we announced the award by the USG of a contract valued at up to approximately $2 billion over 10 years for the continued supply of ACAM2000 into the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), assuming all contract options are exercised. This multiple-year contract is intended to support the replacement of the smallpox vaccine stockpile and included a one-year base period of performance in 2019 valued at approximately $170 million, and nine option years. The number of doses under the base period were delivered by year end 2019. On May 28, 2020, we announced the exercise by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) of the first contract option, valued at $176 million, to procure doses of ACAM2000. The number of doses under the first contract option were delivered by year end 2020. On July 13, 2021, we announced the exercise by HHS of the second contract option, valued at $182.2 million, to procure doses of ACAM2000. The actual number of ACAM2000 doses to be procured in the future is dependent on certain timing and tiered-pricing terms that are subject to the discretion of HHS. 
Anthrasil®. Anthrasil is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment of inhalational anthrax. Anthrasil is licensed by the FDA for the treatment of inhalational anthrax in adult and pediatric patients in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs. Anthrasil also received orphan drug designation for that indication, resulting in market exclusivity in the United States until March 2022. We currently have two contracts with HHS: a development and procurement contract that expires in September 2023, and a multiple award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for the collection of anti-anthrax plasma, as well as the manufacture of such plasma into bulk drug substance and finished drug product and delivery of finished product into the SNS. This contract covers extended plasma storage, and the options for manufacturing and product delivery, which are available to be exercised by HHS through September 2023. In addition to domestic, 

USG sales, Anthrasil has been sold to several foreign governments, including the Canadian government. 
BAT®. BAT is the only equine plasma antitoxin licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of all seven botulinum neurotoxin serotypes. BAT is licensed by the FDA for the treatment of symptomatic botulism following suspected or documented exposure to botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, B, C, D, E, F or G in adults and pediatric patients. It is also licensed in Canada pursuant to Health Canada’s Extraordinary Use New Drugs regulations. BAT is also approved in Singapore and Ukraine. BAT is the only heptavalent botulism antitoxin available in the United States and Canada for treating naturally occurring botulism in adults or pediatric patients. Botulinum toxin is a nerve toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum that causes botulism, a serious paralytic illness. On May 8, 2020, we announced the finalization of a previously announced contract with HHS, valued at up to $550 million, if all options under the contract are exercised. The contract has two deliverables. The first deliverable, negotiated in September 2019 and valued at up to approximately $90 million, is to supply annual doses of BAT into the SNS for 10 years by converting existing bulk drug substance into final drug product. This deliverable also includes options for additional doses valued at up to approximately $94 million over 10 years. The second deliverable, valued at up to approximately $366 million, is for the production of additional doses of bulk drug substance over 10 years to maintain the plasma collection and production capability for botulism response planning. In addition to domestic government sales, BAT continues to be sold internationally, with deliveries to over 16 foreign governments in 2021.
BioThrax®. BioThrax is the only vaccine licensed by the FDA for pre-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease in persons at high risk of exposure. BioThrax is also approved by the FDA for post-exposure prophylaxis administration in combination with antimicrobial therapy in the event of suspected or confirmed exposure to Bacillus anthracis. BioThrax was granted orphan drug designation (market exclusivity) for the post-exposure prophylaxis indication through November 2022; see “Regulation - Marketing Approval - Biologics, Drugs and Vaccines - Orphan Drugs” for a description of orphan drug status. Anthrax is a potentially fatal disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. Inhalational anthrax is the most lethal form of anthrax. In the United States, BioThrax is administered in a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting by intramuscular injection as a three-dose primary series over a six-month period. Per the U.S. label, booster doses are administered 6 and 12 months after completion of the primary series and at 12- month intervals thereafter. 


BioThrax is administered in a post-exposure prophylaxis setting as three subcutaneous injections two weeks apart in conjunction with recommended antibacterial drugs following suspected or confirmed Bacillus anthracis exposure. When we report the revenue associated with “anthrax vaccines,” it reflects the combined revenue from the procurement and sale of BioThrax as well as the product candidate AV7909 (described below).
In December 2016, we signed a follow-on contract with the CDC for the supply of up to approximately 29.4 million doses of BioThrax for delivery into the SNS, over a five-year period ending in September 2021. On September 29, 2021, we were granted a no-cost contract extension, which extended the date through which the USG may procure BioThrax to March 31, 2022.
Raxibacumab injection, a fully human monoclonal antibody. Our raxibacumab product is the first fully human monoclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. Our raxibacumab product is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs and for prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or appropriate. We assumed responsibility for a multi-year contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) from Human Genome Sciences, Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline LLC (collectively referred to as GSK) to supply the product to the SNS through November 2019. All deliveries under this contract are complete. 
RSDL®. RSDL is the only medical device cleared by the FDA that is intended to remove or neutralize chemical warfare agents from the skin, including tabun, sarin, soman, cyclohexyl sarin, VR, VX, mustard gas and T-2 toxin. RSDL has also been cleared as a medical device by Health Canada, has a current European Conformity (CE) mark under European Directives, and is licensed by the Israel Ministry of Health and by Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration. To date, the principal customers for RSDL have been agencies of the USG, including the Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Guard. Our current contract with the DoD, awarded in September 2017, is a five-year contract valued at up to approximately $171 million to supply RSDL for use by all branches of the U.S. military. In addition to the DoD and other USG agencies, beginning in 2017, we made RSDL available for the first time for purchase by civilians in the United States. We have also sold RSDL to 33 foreign countries outside the United States, since the device was cleared in 2003.
Trobigard® atropine sulfate, obidoxime chloride auto-injector. TROBIGARD was approved by the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products of the Belgium Health Authority on February 18, 2021. TROBIGARD is not currently approved or cleared by the FDA. TROBIGARD is only distributed to authorized government buyers for use outside the United States. In Belgium, the TROBIGARD Auto-injector is indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected exposure to nerve agents or toxic organophosphates in adults (age 18 and up). In February 2019, Emergent was awarded a 10-year contract, valued at up to approximately $100 million, by the U.S. Department of State, to deliver our TROBIGARD product, training auto-injectors and RSDL for emergency use outside of the United States. The contract consists of a five-year base period of performance with five one-year option periods. 
VIGIV CNJ-016®. VIGIV is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada to address certain complications from replicating virus smallpox vaccination. The principal customer for VIGIV is the USG, specifically HHS. In June 2019, we announced a contract award by HHS valued at approximately $535 million over 10 years for the continued supply of VIGIV into the SNS for smallpox preparedness. VIGIV has also been procured by a limited number of foreign governments.


Commercial Business Line Products
The current portfolio of our Commercial business line consists of the following products:

COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS

Description of Commercial Business Line Products
NARCAN®. NARCAN, a product we obtained in connection with our acquisition of Adapt Pharma Inc. in 2018, is an intranasal formulation of naloxone approved by the FDA and Health Canada for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose as demonstrated by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. The primary customers for NARCAN are state health departments, local law enforcement agencies, community-based organizations, substance abuse centers, federal agencies and consumers through pharmacies fulfilling physician-directed or standing order prescriptions. We completed two important product life cycle improvements in 2020. First, we launched the Generation II NARCAN device, which has a claim for enhanced temperature excursions and storage below 25°C. Second, we gained FDA approval for an extension of the shelf life of NARCAN from 24 months to 36 months. 
In addition, we have also secured an agreement with Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz) to distribute an authorized generic naloxone nasal spray, which was launched in December 2021 and will be available in the United States via retail pharmacies and institutions, including hospitals. 
Vaxchora®. Vaxchora is a live attenuated cholera vaccine for oral administration and the first vaccine approved by the FDA for the prevention of cholera infection. Cholera is a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and dehydration. It has a low incidence in the United States and Europe, but a high 

incidence in Africa, Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas have historically drawn travelers from the United States and Europe, so cholera can occur in patients who return to the United States or Europe from visits to these regions. Vaxchora is approved in the United States for active immunization against disease caused by V. cholerae serogroup 01 in persons 2 to 64 years of age traveling to cholera-affected areas. Vaxchora is indicated in the EU for active immunization against disease caused by V. cholerae serogroup 01 in adults and children aged 2 years and older. 
We have marketed Vaxchora to a subset of travelers primarily from the United States. Our sales of Vaxchora were diminished in 2020 and 2021 due to the broad disruption to travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect limited sales to resume in 2022 in line with limited anticipated return to international travel.
Vivotif®. Vivotif is a live attenuated vaccine for oral administration to prevent typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is a potentially severe and occasionally life-threatening febrile illness caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, a bacterium that only lives in humans. It is usually acquired by consumption of water or food that has been contaminated by feces of an infected person. Travelers from North America and Europe going to Asia, Africa, and Latin America have historically been particularly at risk. 
We have marketed Vivotif to a subset of travelers primarily from the United States and the European Union. Our sales of Vivotif were diminished in 2020 and 2021 due to the broad disruption to travel caused 


by the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect limited sales to resume in 2022 in line with limited anticipated return to international travel.

Description of Product Candidates
AP003. AP003 (Naloxone multidose nasal spray) is being developed for the emergency treatment of a known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. Naloxone hydrochloride is an opioid antagonist that is intended to antagonize opioid effects by competing for the same receptor sites. Naloxone hydrochloride is intended to reverse the effects of opioids, including respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. It is also intended to reverse the psychotomimetic and dysphoric effects of agonist-antagonists such as pentazocine. 
AP007. AP007 (Sustained release Nalmefene Injectable) is being developed for the treatment of opioid use disorder. AP007 is an extended-release formulation of Nalmefene, an opioid receptor antagonist, intended to continually release an effective dose of Nalmefene for up to three months and to be administered through intramuscular injection. 
AV7909. We are developing AV7909, an anthrax vaccine product candidate based on anthrax vaccine adsorbed combined with an adjuvant for post-exposure prophylaxis of disease following suspected or confirmed exposure to Bacillus anthracis in persons 18 through 65 years of age when administered in conjunction with recommended antibacterial drugs. In 2021, AV7909 was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA. Studies have shown that AV7909 elicits a stronger immune response using fewer doses than BioThrax, allowing patients to reach a protective level of immunity more rapidly. AV7909 is expected to provide protection with a two-dose regimen (versus the BioThrax three-dose regimen) for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease, when administered in combination with the recommended antibacterial drugs. In September 2016, we signed a combination development and procurement contract with BARDA, which included a five-year base period of performance to develop AV7909 for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease and to deliver to the SNS an initial two million doses, subsequently modified to three million doses in March 2017. The contract also includes procurement options for the delivery of an additional 7.5 million to 50 million doses of AV7909 into the SNS and options for an additional clinical study and post marketing commitments. In 2019, we initiated and completed enrollment of a Phase 3 study; the 3,850 subject trial evaluating safety, immunogenicity and lot consistency was completed in 2020. In collaboration with us, the CDC filed with the FDA a pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) submission package related to AV7909. Following this submission, BARDA began procuring AV7909, exercising its first contract option in July 2019 (valued at approximately $261 million) to procure doses to be 

delivered to the SNS through June of 2020, its second contract option in June 2020 (valued at $258 million) to procure additional doses of AV7909 for delivery into the SNS over 12 months and, most recently, in September 2021 funding another contract option (valued at approximately $399 million) to deliver doses of AV7909 to the SNS over 18 months. In December 2021, we commenced our submission of a BLA for AV7909 to the FDA, although there can be no assurance it will be approved by the FDA. When we report the revenue associated with “anthrax vaccines,” it reflects the combined revenue from the procurement and sale of AV7909 as well as BioThrax (described above).
CGRD-001.  The CGRD-001 auto-injector is being developed for treatment of poisoning by organophosphorus nerve agents, as well as organophosphorus compounds, in an auto-injector for protection of soldiers and first responders. CGRD-001 is being developed as an auto-injector capable of delivering intramuscular 2-PAM (600 mg) and atropine (2 mg) through self- or buddy-aid to service members following nerve agent exposure. 
CHIKV VLP. We are developing a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidate, CHIKV VLP, to be administered as a single dose for active immunization against chikungunya disease. There is currently no licensed vaccine, VLP or otherwise, to prevent chikungunya virus disease. The structure of the CHIKV VLP is nearly identical to the wild-type virus but does not pose a risk of replication. Studies conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center and Emergent have shown that the CHIKV VLP vaccine is safe and elicits high titer neutralizing antibodies, which are needed to protect against chikungunya virus. In 2021, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial for CHIKV VLP. Our CHIKV VLP vaccine candidate received Breakthrough Therapy designation and Fast Track designation from the FDA in October 2020 and May 2018, respectively, and PRIME designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in September 2019.
COVID-HIG. COVID-HIG is a fully human polyclonal antibody therapeutic product candidate made from plasma with high titers to SARS-CoV-2. COVID-HIG is being developed as a potential treatment of COVID-19 disease in SARS-CoV-2 positive outpatients who are at high risk of progression to severe disease. In collaboration with NIAID and BARDA, Emergent is currently participating in an international Phase 3 clinical trial in outpatients known as INSIGHT-012. With DoD funding, in 2021, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical study evaluating alternate routes of administration (low-dose IV, subcutaneous, and intramuscular) to enable broader access to treatment. COVID-HIG has been provided under emergency 


Investigational New Drug (IND) to treat hospitalized patients in need.
EGRD-001. The EGRD-001 auto-injector is being developed for treatment of status epilepticus and severe recurrent convulsive seizures caused by nerve agent poisoning, in an auto-injector for protection of soldiers and first responders. EGRD-001 is being developed as an auto-injector capable of delivering intramuscular Diazepam (10 mg) through buddy-aid to service members who are actively seizing.
SIAN. We are developing SIAN (stabilized Isoamyl nitrate) as an antidote for initial treatment of acute poisoning of cyanide that is judged to be serious or life threatening. The USG's 2015 Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise Strategy and Implementation Plan identifies cyanide (CN) as a high-priority threat. Historically, CN has been used as a chemical warfare agent and could be an agent for a terrorist attack. CN also represents a threat from accidental poisoning, such as industrial accidents or exposure during building fires. This BARDA-funded medical countermeasure will see the development of a single-use intranasal spray device that can be rapidly deployed and easily dispensed so that it will deliver SIAN following a cyanide incident or in a mass exposure setting.
UniFlu. We are developing a universal influenza vaccine candidate based on a nanoparticle vaccine that self-assembles during production and that displays a cross-reactive hemagglutinin (HA) antigen for active immunization against influenza virus A and B. The self-assembling HA stabilized stem nanoparticle technology was developed by and licensed from the NIAID Vaccine Research Center. Using this technology, a universal influenza vaccine could be designed to confer protection against divergent, constantly evolving strains and subtypes of influenza virus. In 2021, we initiated a phase 1 study designed to demonstrate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the influenza virus A components of the vaccine candidate with future studies planned to investigate additional components for full coverage against all influenza virus A and B strains.

supply chain activities, as well as facility and equipment investments.
BARDA Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing Relationship. In 2012, we entered into the Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADM) Contract with the US Government, a 25-year agreement with BARDA under which we would prepare a facility to be able to manufacture 50 million doses of influenza vaccine in four months in the case of a pandemic. Since that time, we have invested over $200 million of our own funds towards readiness of the facility. In mid 2020, following declaration of a public health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, BARDA issued task orders under this agreement to reserve capacity at the facility to control which vaccine candidates would be manufactured in the facility’s reserved space. On November 1, 2021, we entered into contract modifications (the Modifications) with BARDA under which we mutually agreed to terminate the CIADM, along with all associated task orders, including the task order issued on May 30, 2020 to reserve capacity and expand manufacturing of drug substance for third-party COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The Modifications reduced the total contract value to be realized under the task orders to $470.9 million from $650.8 million. The total base CIADM Contract value to be realized was reduced to $140.5 million from $163.2 million. Other than customary post-termination activities, there are no ongoing obligations related to these contracts.
Marketing and Sales
We have dedicated sales channels for each of our business lines.
Government - MCM Business Line.
We partner with stakeholders in the USG and domestic NGOs to support procurement of our MCM products and procured product candidates.
We also partner with foreign governments as well as NGOs to support procurement of MCM products and procured product candidates internationally.
Our specialized team has expertise and experience in the public and private sector, dealing with counterterrorism, CBRNE preparedness and public health. 
Commercial Business Line.
NARCAN is sold directly to state and local governments and used by first responders, including: police, firefighters and emergency medical teams. In addition, NARCAN is dispensed to patients at risk of an opioid overdose through retail pharmacies as prescribed by a physician.

Vivotif® and Vaxchora® are vaccines intended for use by travelers heading to regions where there is a risk of exposure to certain infectious diseases and, therefore, are sold to channels that address travel health. We sell to both wholesalers and distributors as well as directly to healthcare practitioners. The primary commercial customers of Vivotif and Vaxchora are private travel clinics, retail pharmacies and integrated hospital networks. Sales of these products were significantly reduced in 2020 and 2021 due to the broader disruption to travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect limited sales to resume in 2022 in line with limited anticipated return to international travel.
Services - CDMO Business Line.
We market our CDMO services to the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and government/NGOs. We also provided CDMO services to the USG, which ended in 2021. Our CDMO services are supported by a dedicated group of sales and business development, marketing, customer experience, and commercial operations professionals qualified to represent our full breadth of service offerings to the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and governments/NGOs.
Competition
 Our products and any product or product candidate that we acquire or successfully develop and commercialize are likely to compete with current products and product candidates that are in development for the same indications. Specifically, the competition for our products and product candidates includes the following:
•AV7909 and BioThrax. AV7909 and BioThrax are currently procured, primarily by the USG, for prevention of anthrax disease. While there are no vaccines, other than BioThrax, approved by the FDA for prevention of anthrax disease, and none other than AV7909 and BioThrax that have been procured by the SNS, we face potential future competition for the supply of anthrax vaccines if the USG chooses to procure products or product candidates for any programs currently in development. Altimmune, Inc., GC Pharma, Blue Willow Biologics, and Greffex are each currently developing anthrax vaccine product candidates, which are in various stages of clinical development. Of the product candidates, Altimmune and Blue Willow Biologics have completed Phase 1 trials. 
•NARCAN®. NARCAN is the first FDA-approved intranasal naloxone spray for the emergency reversal of opioid overdoses. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. and its Canadian affiliate (collectively, Teva) have 


filed applications for generic versions of an intranasal naloxone spray based on NARCAN with the FDA and Health Canada. Teva recently launched its generic naxolone nasal spray in the United States. NARCAN also faces branded competition from other injectable naloxone, auto-injectors and improvised nasal kits, including Kloxxado™ (naloxone HCI) nasal spray 8 mg, a branded product developed by Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. which delivers a higher dose naloxone nasal spray. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s naloxone injection product, Teleflex Medical Inc's Intranasal Mucosal Atomization Device and Zimhi™ (naloxone), a branded injectable product developed by Adamis. In addition, Orexo AB and Harm Reduction Therapeutics both have development programs for naloxone nasal spray formulations intended for use in opioid overdose reversal. NARCAN may face additional generic and branded competition in the future. 
•ACAM2000®. ACAM2000 faces competition from JYNNEOSTM, which is licensed by the FDA for the prevention of smallpox and monkeypox disease in adults 18 years of age and older determined to be at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection. JYNNEOS is also approved in Canada and in the European Union under the trade names IMVAMUNE® and IMVANEX®, respectively. ACAM2000 remains the primary smallpox vaccine stockpiled by the USG and offers key features for public health mass vaccination programs that are critical, including a single dose vaccination schedule and multi-dose vial presentation. While therapeutics generally do not compete directly with vaccines, our sales to the USG are dependent upon U.S. policy of stockpiling vaccines for emergency use. There are two approved smallpox therapeutics medicines in the United States made by SIGA Technologies, Inc. (SIGA) and Chimerix (TEMBEXA®)and in the event USG policy regarding smallpox vaccine and therapeutic stockpiling was to change, our sales could be adversely affected.
•Raxibacumab injection, a fully human monoclonal antibody and Anthrasil®. Our raxibacumab product is the first FDA licensed fully human anthrax monoclonal antibody therapeutic and Anthrasil is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of inhalational anthrax in adult and pediatric patients in combination with appropriate 

antibacterial drugs. Elusys Therapeutics, Inc. has obtained FDA licensure for Anthim® (obiltoxaximab) injection, a chimeric (or partially human) antibody indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax. Obiltoxaximab is also approved in Canada and the EU.
•BAT®. Our botulinum antitoxin immune globulin product is the only heptavalent antitoxin licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of symptomatic botulism for all seven botulinum neurotoxin serotypes. Direct competition is currently limited.
•CNJ-016®. Our VIGIV product is the only therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada to address adverse events from smallpox vaccination with replicating virus smallpox vaccines. While direct competition in terms of the treatment of smallpox vaccination side effects is limited, SIGA has obtained FDA approval for TPOXX® (tecovirimat), an oral therapy for the treatment of smallpox disease TPOXX is currently procured by the SNS. Chimerix has also recently been granted FDA approval for TEMBEXA®(brincidofovir) tablets and oral suspension approval for the treatment of smallpox. 
•RSDL®. In the United States, the RSDL Kit is the only medical device cleared by the FDA to remove or neutralize chemical warfare agents and T-2 toxin from the skin. Internationally, various Ministries of Defense have procured Fullers Earth, Dutch Powder and French Powder as a preparedness countermeasure for the decontamination of liquid chemical weapons from the skin.
•Trobigard® atropine sulfate, obidoxime chloride auto-injector. In the United States, Meridian Medical Technologies has been the primary supplier of nerve-agent antidote auto-injectors. In the United States and internationally, there have been supply disruptions of Meridian Medical Technologies auto-injectors leading to shortages of these emergency use devices. The USG has funded the development of a number of nerve agent antidote auto-injectors including development programs at Emergent, Aktiv Pharma Group, Kaleo and others. Outside of the United States there are a number of suppliers of these devices though few with approvals from national or regional regulatory authorities.
•Vivotif®. Vivotif is the only FDA-approved oral typhoid vaccine. In the markets where Vivotif 


is licensed, it competes primarily with Sanofi Pasteur’s Typhim VI® vaccine, an injectable polysaccharide typhoid vaccine.
•Vaxchora®. In the United States, Vaxchora is the only FDA-licensed vaccine available indicated to prevent cholera. Vaxchora is the only single dose cholera vaccine in the EU and is subject to competition by Valneva’s Dukoral® two-dose cholera vaccine in the EU. 
Services - CDMO Business Line
We also compete for CDMO services with a number of biopharmaceutical product R&D organizations, contract manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products, other embedded CDMO organizations, and university research laboratories. 
•Companies with which we compete for CDMO services include, among others: Lonza Group Ltd., Catalent, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Curia Global, Inc., Charles River Laboratories, Avid Bioservices, KBI Biopharma, Vetter Pharma, and FUJIFILM Dionsynth Biotechnologies. We also compete with in-house research, development and support service departments of other biopharmaceutical companies.
Geographical Reliance
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company's revenue from U.S. customers as a percentage of total revenues were 92%, 93% and 90%, respectively.
MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS
Our development and manufacturing network allows us to deploy capabilities and capacity for clinical and commercial supply needs. 
Supplies and Raw Materials
We currently rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to manufacture some of the supplies we require for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, as well as supplies and raw materials used in the production of our products. Typically, we acquire these supplies and raw materials on a purchase order basis and, when possible, in quantities we believe adequate to meet our needs. We obtain Alhydrogel® adjuvant 2%, used to manufacture AV7909 and BioThrax, from a single-source supplier for which we currently have no alternative source of supply. However, we maintain stored supplies of this adjuvant in quantities believed to be sufficient to meet our expected manufacturing needs. We also utilize single-source suppliers for other raw materials in our manufacturing processes.

We utilize single source suppliers for all components of NARCAN. It is manufactured by a third party, which operates a full service offering from formulation to final packaging. Materials for production of NARCAN, such as the naloxone active pharmaceutical ingredient and other excipients, along with the vial, stopper and device are produced around the world by other third parties and delivered to the primary manufacturer and released to manufacturing following appropriate testing.
We rely on single source suppliers for our plasma collection to support the Anthrasil, VIGIV and BAT programs. We work closely with our suppliers for these specialty programs and operate under long term agreements. We order quantities of material in advance in quantities believed to be sufficient to meet upcoming demand requirements. 
The rapid demand for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics in light of the current pandemic has caused significant demand for raw materials for the vaccine and therapeutics we are manufacturing. Furthermore, competition for limited supplies of such raw materials from other manufacturers of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics may limit our ability to manufacture on a timely basis.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We actively seek to protect intellectual property related to our Company's assets, including patent rights, trademark rights, trade secrets and proprietary confidential information, through defense and enforcement of existing rights and pursuit of protection on new and arising innovations. The duration of and the type of protection for patent rights depends upon many factors including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions or administrative term adjustments, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patents. We are a party to various license agreements, including those under which we license patents, patent applications, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. It is our policy to ethically consider the enforcement and defense of our intellectual property rights, and to respect the intellectual property rights of others.
REGULATION
Regulations in the United States and other countries have a significant impact on our product development, manufacturing and marketing activities.
Government Contracting
Our status as a USG contractor means that we are subject to various statutes and regulations, including:


•the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and agency-specific regulations supplemental to FAR, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of government contracts;
•the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARs) and agency-specific regulations supplemental to DFARs, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of DoD government contracts;
•the Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR) which regulates the relationship between a Department of State organization and a contractor or potential contractor;
•business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;
•export and import control laws and regulations, including but not limited to ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations); and
•laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.
USG agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors for compliance with applicable laws and standards. Our role and status as a large government supplier to HHS, particularly BARDA and the SNS, increases the likelihood of Congressional review and oversight. The oversight and regulations we are subject to can impose stricter penalties than those normally applicable to commercial contracts, such as criminal and civil liability and suspension and debarment from future government contracting. In addition, pursuant to various regulations, our government contracts can be subject to unilateral termination or modification by the government for convenience, detailed auditing and accounting systems requirements, statutorily controlled pricing, sourcing and subcontracting restrictions and statutorily mandated processes for adjudicating contract disputes. 

The Project BioShield Act of 2004. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 (Project BioShield) was enacted to augment market incentives for companies pursuing the development of MCMs of which the government is the only significant market. Project BioShield provided $5.6 billion over 10 years to develop, purchase, and stockpile MCMs for use in a public health emergency against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRNE) agents.
The Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 and Reauthorization Acts. The Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 (PAHPA) established a new Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within HHS and provided new authorities for a number of programs, including the creation of BARDA for the advanced research and development and procurement of MCMs for CBRNE. The Pandemic All Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (PAHPRA) continued BARDA’s role and reauthorized Project BioShield funding through fiscal year 2018 and provided BARDA with additional appropriations to support advanced R&D. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2019 (PAHPAIA) reauthorized Project BioShield’s special reserve fund and authorized 10-year funding for product development. BARDA has used the incentives under Project BioShield and subsequent reauthorizations of it to build a robust pipeline of MCMs for multiple CBRNE threat agents. It has also procured and stockpiled many of our related products for potential use in the event of a PHT emergency, including BioThrax, ACAM2000, Anthrasil, BAT, VIGIV and raxibacumab.
Funding for BARDA is provided by annual appropriations by Congress. Congress appropriates annual funding for procurements of MCMs for the SNS (currently managed by ASPR) and for the NIAID to conduct biodefense research. This appropriation funding supplements amounts available under Project BioShield.


Emergency Use Authorization
As amended by Project BioShield and subsequent legislation, including PAHPRA and the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDCA permits the Secretary of HHS to authorize the introduction into interstate commerce of unapproved MCMs, or approved MCMs for unapproved uses, in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been declared by designated government officials (known as emergency use). The types of emergencies that trigger these authorities include public health emergencies announced by the Secretary of HHS, military emergencies announced by the Secretary of Defense, domestic emergencies announced by the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the identification of a material threat pursuant to Section 319-F-2 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) that is sufficient to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad. After one of the emergencies has been announced, the Secretary of HHS may authorize the issuance of, and the FDA Commissioner may issue, EUAs for the use of specific products based on criteria established by statute, including that the product at issue may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by CBRNE threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. EUAs are subject to additional conditions and restrictions, are product-specific, and terminate when the emergency determination underlying the EUA terminates.
Under PAHPRA, the USG may also, at its discretion, purchase critical biodefense products for the SNS prior to FDA approval after the filing of a pre-EUA application with the FDA. BARDA is currently procuring AV7909 from us pursuant to this authority, a product candidate which has not yet been approved by the FDA.
Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) creates liability immunity for manufacturers of MCMs when the Secretary of HHS issues a declaration for their manufacture, administration or use. A PREP Act declaration is intended to provide liability immunity from claims under federal or state law for loss arising out of the administration or use of a covered MCM under a government contract. The only statutory exception to this immunity is for actions or failures to act that constitute willful misconduct. The Secretary of HHS has issued PREP Act declarations identifying BioThrax, ACAM2000, raxibacumab, Anthrasil, BAT and VIGIV, as covered MCMs. These declarations expire in 2022.
Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technology Act of 2002 (SAFETY Act). The SAFETY Act was enacted to create liability limitations for qualifying anti-terrorism technologies for claims arising from or 

related to an act of terrorism. Renewal of coverage of BioThrax under the SAFETY Act is pending. Even if we renew coverage of the SAFETY Act for BioThrax and RSDL, such benefits may not provide adequate protection from all claims made against us.
Product Development for Therapeutics and Vaccines
Pre-Clinical Testing. We generally perform pre-clinical safety and efficacy testing on our product candidates before we initiate clinical trials.
Animal Rule. Conducting controlled clinical trials with human patients to determine efficacy may sometimes be unethical or unfeasible. In such circumstances, products may be approved under the FDA’s “Animal Rule.” According to the FDA, this regulatory pathway can only be pursued if conducting human efficacy studies is unethical and field trials, after an accidental or deliberate exposure, are not feasible. Under the “Animal Rule,” under some circumstances, approval of product candidates can be based on clinical data from trials in healthy subjects that demonstrate adequate safety and immunogenicity as well as efficacy data from animal studies. 
Investigational New Drug Application. Before clinical testing may begin, the results of pre-clinical testing and other available clinical data and manufacturing information must be submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical studies. The FDA may impose a full or partial clinical hold on clearance of an IND pending receipt of additional information.
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve administration of a product candidate to healthy human volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified physician under a regulatory agency approved protocol for the country in which the human trial is to be conducted. Human clinical trials typically are conducted in the following three sequential phases. 
•Phase 1 involves introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects and early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase 2 involves studies to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications, explore tolerance, optimal dosage, and safety.
•Phase 3 trials must demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of healthy subjects or patients, and permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk 


relationship of the product and provide adequate information for drug labeling. 
Phase 4 studies may also be conducted following marketing approval to provide additional data related to drug use. The FDA may impose a temporary or permanent clinical hold, or other sanctions, if it believes that a clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects.
Good Clinical Practice. All phases of clinical studies must be conducted in conformance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practices (GCP) which are ethical and scientific quality standards for conducting clinical trials.
Marketing Approval – Biologics, Drugs and Vaccines
Biologics License Application/New Drug Application. For large molecule products, such as vaccines, products derived from blood and blood components, and antibodies, all data obtained from a development program, including research and product development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical trials, labeling and related information are submitted in a BLA to the FDA and in similar regulatory filings with the corresponding agencies in other countries for review and approval. For small molecule drugs, this information is submitted in a new drug application (NDA) filing. The submission of an application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may issue a refuse to file, or RTF, letter to the applicant and request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted. Most applications are subject to a substantial application fee and, if approved, will be assessed an annual fee. Under the FDCA, the FDA has the authority to grant waivers of certain user fees.
In reviewing a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant approval, request more information or data, or deny the application if it determines the application does not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness and/or that the drug is not safe for use under the conditions of use in the proposed labeling. If the FDA decides not to approve an application, it will issue a complete response letter, or CRL. The FDA will also typically inspect one or more clinical sites to ensure compliance with GCPs as well as the facility or facilities at which the candidate is manufactured to ensure compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs).
We are working on a BLA for filing with the FDA related to AV7909, a portion of which we submitted to the FDA in December of 2021. The receipt of regulatory approval may take many years, and typically 

involves the expenditure of substantial financial resources. Accordingly, there can be no assurances we will receive approval for AV7909 from the FDA. The FDA may also impose conditions upon approval or significantly limit the indications approved for a given product and/or require, as a condition of approval, enhanced labeling, packaging, post-approval clinical trials, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials or restrictions on consumer advertising, which could negatively impact the commercial success of a product.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications and Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications. Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval under a full NDA for innovator products, or an abbreviated new drug application for generic products. Relevant to Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs, each an ANDA) the Hatch-Waxman amendments to the FDCA established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of ANDAs for generic versions of branded drugs previously approved by the FDA (RLDs)). Because the safety and efficacy of RLDs have already been established by the brand company (sometimes referred to as the innovator), the FDA does not require ANDA applicants to independently demonstrate safety and efficacy of generic products. However, a generic manufacturer is required to demonstrate that its product contains the same active ingredient as, and is bioequivalent to, the innovator product. Bioequivalence is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent for absorption of the generic product and the listed drug. 
A third alternative for approval of a drug product is commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings with respect to certain pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for certain label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the applicant.
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents of the applicant or that are held by third parties whose claims cover the 


applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any subsequent applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make one of the following certifications to the FDA concerning patents: (1) the patent information concerning the RLD has not been submitted to the FDA; (2) any such patent that was filed has expired; (3) the date on which such patent will expire; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. 
If the RLD’s NDA holder or patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired.
Biosimilar Products. When a biological product is licensed for marketing by FDA with approval of a BLA, the product may be entitled to certain types of market and data exclusivity barring FDA from approving competing products for certain periods of time under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA). The BPCIA amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA may approve a biosimilar product if it finds that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the innovator product and the proposed biosimilar product. For the FDA to approve an interchangeable biosimilar product, it must conclude that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and would increase safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy. 
An innovator biological product is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on that biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. However, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own pre-clinical data and data from adequate and 

well‑controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. There have been recent government proposals to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period, but none has been enacted to date. At the same time, since passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, which address pharmacy practices involving biosimilar products.
Post-Approval Requirements. Any drug, biologic or medical device product for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, cGMPs and restrictions on advertising and promotion. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product’s distribution or use and, potentially, withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. The FDA may also require post-approval clinical trials and/or safety labeling changes. 
Facilities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to be registered with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other laws. 
A company that is found to have improperly promoted unapproved or off-label uses or otherwise not to have met applicable promotion rules may be subject to significant liability under both the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act.
Orphan Drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, an applicant can request the FDA to designate a product as an “orphan drug" in the United States if the drug is intended to treat an orphan, or rare, disease or condition. A disease or condition is considered orphan if it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. A manufacturer must request orphan drug designation prior to submitting a BLA or NDA. Products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for special grant funding for R&D, FDA assistance with the review of clinical trial protocols, potential tax credits for research, reduced filing fees for marketing applications and a special seven-year period of market exclusivity after marketing approval. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved.
Orphan drug exclusivity (afforded to the first applicant to receive approval for an orphan designated drug) prevents FDA approval of applications by others for the same drug for the designated orphan disease or condition. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of the same product marketed by a different 


manufacturer under certain circumstances, including if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand or the subsequent product is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care.
Vaccine and Therapeutic Product Lot Protocol. Because the manufacturing process for biological products is complex, the FDA requires for many biologics, including most vaccines and immune globulin products, that each product lot undergo thorough testing for purity, potency, identity and sterility. Several of our vaccines are subject to lot release protocols by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. 
 Marketing Approval – Devices
Devices may fall within the definition of a Medical Device or may be a Combination Product including both a device for delivery of a drug product and the drug product itself. Medical Devices are also subject to FDA clearance or approval and extensive regulation under the FDCA. 
Medical devices are classified into one of three classes -- Class I, Class II or Class III - depending on the degree of risk and the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of each medical device. Medical devices deemed to pose lower risks are generally placed in either Class I or II. Pre-market review and clearance by the FDA for Class I and II medical devices is accomplished through a pre-market notification procedure, unless the device is exempt. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-supporting or implantable devices, are generally placed in Class III. 
Both before and after a medical device is commercially distributed, manufacturers and marketers of the device have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, record keeping, reports of adverse events, labeling and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Device manufacturers are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by the FDA for compliance with cGMP requirements.
A combination product is a product comprised of two or more regulated components (e.g., a drug and device) that are combined into a single product, co-packaged, or sold separately but intended for co-administration, as evidenced by the labeling for the products. Like their constituent products—e.g., drugs and devices—combination products are highly regulated and subject to a broad range of post marketing requirements including cGMPs, adverse event reporting, periodic reports, labeling and 

advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions, market withdrawal and recall. 
The FDA also administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the United States, as international sales of medical devices that have not received FDA approval are subject to FDA export requirements.
Manufacturing Requirements
The FDA's regulations require that medicinal products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and they are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements.
Inspections must follow a "risk-based schedule" that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. The FDA's regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved product. 
Regulation Outside of the U.S.
Currently, we maintain a commercial presence in the United States and Canada as well as certain other countries. In the European Union, medicinal products are authorized following a process that is similarly demanding as the process required in the United States. Drug products may be authorized in one of two ways, either through the decentralized procedure, which provides for the mutual recognition procedure of national approval decisions by the competent authorities of the European Union (EU) Member States or through the centralized procedure by the European Commission, which provides for the grant of a single 


marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. Each foreign country subjects medical devices to its own regulatory requirements. We are also subject to many of the same continuing post-approval requirements in the EU as we are in the United States (e.g., good manufacturing practices). 
Potential Sanctions.
For all FDA-regulated products, if the FDA finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or that a product is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk, it can institute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies, including but not limited to:
•restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;
•restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;

Health regulatory authorities in other countries have similar rules and regulations although the specifics vary jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
Fraud, Abuse and Anti-Corruption Laws
The United States and most other jurisdictions have detailed requirements that apply to government and private health care programs, and a broad range of fraud and abuse laws, transparency laws, and other laws. Relevant U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute;
•The False Claims Act;
•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as 

amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act;
•The price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992;
•The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program; and
•Analogous and similar state laws and regulations. 
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to criminal or civil penalties.
Our operations are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA by the activities of our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents. As a public company, the FCPA also requires us to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all of our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our operations are also subject to compliance with the U.K. Bribery Act, which applies to bribery activities both in the public and private sector, Canada’s Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and similar laws in other countries.
Regulations Governing Reimbursement
The marketing practices of U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers are also subject to federal and state healthcare laws related to government funded healthcare programs.
In the United States, certain of our products are reimbursed under federal and state health care programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, TriCare, and or state pharmaceutical assistance programs. Many foreign countries have similar laws.
Various U.S. federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally funded health care programs, including federal and state anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, and anti-self-referral laws, which may apply to federal and state-funded Medicaid and other health care programs and private third-party payers.
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to criminal or civil penalties.


Additionally, drug pricing is an active area for regulatory reform at the federal and state levels, and significant changes to current drug pricing and reimbursement structures in the United States continue to be considered and enacted.
Data Privacy Laws
A number of states in the United States have passed or introduced bills, which, if passed, impose operational requirements on U.S. companies similar to the requirements reflected in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which came into effect on January 1, 2020, requires covered companies that process personal information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new private right of action for data breaches. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorney generals are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The compliance and other burdens imposed by the EU's GDPR, CCPA and similar privacy laws and regulations may be substantial as they are subject to differing interpretations and implementation among jurisdictions. The restrictions imposed by such laws may require us to modify our data handling practices and impose additional compliance costs and burdens.
Other Industry Regulation
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export, use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents used in connection with our product development, are or may be applicable to our activities.

HUMAN CAPITAL
We value our employees and the contributions each of them makes to achieving our mission to protect and enhance life. We are committed to working together toward our long-term aspiration to protect and enhance one billion lives by 2030. One of the five core objectives of our 2020-2024 strategic plan is to evolve the culture of our organization consistent with our strategic objectives and our values. We strive to create an environment that is professionally and personally rewarding by offering challenging work and projects for individual and team contribution, and opportunities for professional and personal development. Another core objective of our current strategic plan is to build scalable capabilities; this objective includes continuing to invest in growing and developing leadership, innovation and engagement at all levels of our workforce. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,416 employees. 
Health, Wellness and Safety
Employee safety and well-being is of paramount importance to us and was of continued focus in 2021 in light of COVID-19. In response to the global pandemic, we immediately adjusted our operations to ensure that only operation-critical development and manufacturing employees worked on-site, and we transitioned all other employees to remote work and equipped them with productivity and collaboration tools and resources. 
As the extent of the pandemic unfolded, increased attention was focused on the health and safety of our on-site employees. We provided them with personal protective equipment and implemented new safety protocols, including re-engineered 


workplace designs that facilitate physical distancing, temperature screening and access to COVID-19 testing. The frequency and methods of communication between management and employees were increased with regular all-hands virtual meetings to discuss what we were doing as a company to combat COVID-19 in conjunction with our USG and private sector partners, and what we were doing to protect our workers. 
In addition, we enhanced and promoted programs to support our employees’ physical and mental well-being. For example, we offered supplemental paid time off to employees who were unable to work due to COVID-19 symptoms or diagnosis, or who needed to address family COVID-19 issues. We arranged and paid for COVID-19 tests for employees who worked on-site. We also partnered with a leading provider of online mental health support and counseling to maintain and expand our employees’ access to available mental health resources. 
Hiring and Talent Management 
We focus on building leaders at every level with the requisite scientific, technical and professional skills to develop and deliver products and services that protect life. In 2021, we expanded our global workforce and hired and onboarded over 600 full-time employees. We have consistent talent processes and systems across the company including performance management, training and development and succession planning. We recognize the need for ongoing skill enhancement and support continued learning through on-the-job assignments, training programs, tuition assistance professional memberships and professional conference attendance. We use the Gallup Q12 instrument to measure employee engagement and inclusion on an annual basis and administer “pulse surveys” throughout the year to gather feedback on matters of interest and importance to our employees and our business.

Compensation and Benefits
Our total rewards plan consists of competitive salaries, bonuses, and for employees in eligible roles, equity awards based on company, group and individual performance. We focus on results and behavior because we value how we do things as much as getting them done. It is this approach that underpins our pay-for-performance philosophy and emphasis on salary transparency. By providing salary ranges, information on individual performance, and the linkage of those two to merit increases, employees have a fuller understanding of their compensation and confidence that their pay is fair and competitive. We recognize the need for ongoing skill enhancement and support continued learning through on-the-job assignments, training programs, tuition assistance, professional memberships and professional conference attendance.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Commitment 
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is integral to how we operate and our success. We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent reflecting a diversity of ideas, backgrounds, and perspectives. DEI fuels our business growth, drives innovation in the products and services we develop, in the way we solve problems, and how we serve the needs of a global and diverse patient, customer and partner base. We recognize the value that diversity contributes to our global organization and the competitive advantage we can maintain by cultivating a culture of inclusion to benefit from our broad range of talents, perspectives, and ideas. We demonstrate respect for the individual by providing fair and equal treatment to all our employees and continuously identifying ways to recognize their various needs and interests. In this regard, we recently launched three inaugural Emergent Resource Groups (ERGs) for black, women and veteran employees. While aligned by constituency, our ERGs are open to all employees and are another way we will continue building a sense of belonging and connection to the organization, which will strengthen our community. These groups will open pathways of communication, help to expand learning opportunities, and offer avenues to advance our business strategy. 
We thrive on our differences while sharing the same core values to achieve our mission — to protect and enhance life. 


ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE 
Our mission to protect and enhance life has motivated us to explore our impact at a broader scale — environmental, social and governance (ESG) stewardship, corporate responsibility, and ethics. Our approach to these issues is the foundation of good governance and strengthens accountability in all aspects of our business activities and relationships. ESG has always been an area of focus for us, but in 2021 we established a formal ESG review process focused on identifying, measuring, and reporting on our ESG activities and progress and issued our inaugural ESG report in the fourth quarter of last year (the ESG Report). The ESG Report can be found at: https://www.emergentbiosolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EBSI-2020-ESG-Report.pdf. 
Starting in 2012, we also established a platform, that we call eGIVE (Give, Invest, Volunteer), that we have continued to expand since its inception. Through this platform, we have encouraged employees to make contributions to select charitable organizations and volunteer their time, which we have supported with paid time off to support socially responsible activities.
