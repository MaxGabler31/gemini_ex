ITEM 1 - Business.
Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with an emphasis on identifying the genetic drivers of disease and applying this understanding to the pursuit of differentiated novel therapies primarily for pediatric onset, life-altering diseases, including rare and orphan diseases. We look to find treatments for genetically defined diseases for which there are limited therapeutic options currently available, with a primary focus on pediatric patients. This strategy begins with identifying and genetically validating a therapeutic target and using genomics to guide product development. The strategy also involves identifying and acquiring otherwise abandoned or overlooked drug candidates and matching targets and mechanisms of action to novel genetic discoveries. 
 
We have partnered with the Center for Applied Genomics, or CAG, at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, or CHOP, to implement a genomic medicine driven approach to drug development. Included in the assets at CAG is a fully automated biorepository containing specimens from more than 75,000 pediatric patients and 150,000 relatives of those patients. The sample is highly enriched for rare and orphan diseases and the large majority of patients have been genotyped. Their phenotypes are recorded in a modern electronic health record that is linked to the genomics database and biorepository. The patients in the database have consented to anonymized use of their data for research and follow up contact if needed.
 
CAG’s efforts focus on the discovery of important and novel genetic biomarkers by both genome-wide association studies and exome sequencing and analysis of affected individuals and their family members. Such markers not only identify patients with the disease but frequently point to the potential cause of the disease and suggest targets and feasible intervention strategies that include protein or peptide therapy, monoclonal antibodies, drugs or gene therapy. By working initially in pediatric populations of specific diseases, we can try to minimize the confounding environmental factors seen in older patients. In addition, the availability of robust genetic biomarkers allows us to design trials that focus on a highly-enriched patient population that we believe is more likely to respond to targeted therapies and further enhance the likelihood of clinical and regulatory success. We believe this will allow us to implement clinical development programs that will lead to medicines that can address critical needs in patients suffering from rare and orphan diseases.
 
Our Product Pipeline
 
The following table summarizes the status of our development programs as of the date of this Annual Report:
 

AEVI-001 (mGluR+ Genetic Subset ADHD)
 
The initial program from our genomic research collaboration with CHOP was the development candidate AEVI-001, an oral, non-stimulant glutamatergic neuromodulator. Through our acquisition of neuroFix, LLC, or neuroFix, in September 2015, we acquired the rights to develop AEVI-001 (then known as NFC-1), as well as the rights to certain data derived from a clinical trial and other studies of AEVI-001.

The selection of AEVI-001 for development in the mGluR+ ADHD patients was the result of a rational search process conducted to specifically identify therapeutic candidates with a demonstrated ability to modulate glutamate signaling via the mGluR network. The role of glutamate in ADHD and other CNS disorders is supported by recent neuroimaging studies that suggest glutamate levels are abnormal in children with ADHD. These abnormalities appear to be concentrated in the anterior singular cortex region of the brain, as evidenced by volumetric and functional magnetic resonance imagery studies, as well as targeted studies of magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Additional supportive evidence for targeting glutamate modulation is provided by genetic studies that have identified mutations in glutamatergic genes that are enriched in children with ADHD.
 
Development of AEVI-001 in mGluR+ Genetic Subset ADHD
 
We completed an AEVI-001 Phase 2/3 trial (which we refer to as the SAGA trial) in adolescent ADHD patients with specific mutations in their mGluR gene network, which we refer to as mGluR+ ADHD, in the first quarter of 2017. Although AEVI-001 did not meet the primary endpoint of reduction on the ADHD rating scale (ADHD-RS) compared to placebo, in the SAGA trial, the drug did demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement compared to placebo in a pre-specified responder analysis of ADHD-RS improvement of 30% or more [ADHD-RS reduction of 17.6, p < .005]. In a second pre-specified responder analysis of Clinical Global Impression of Improvement scale (CGI-I), a key secondary endpoint, AEVI-001 demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement compared to placebo [57% of patients treated with AEVI-001 achieved a score of much improved or very much improved compared to 33% on placebo, p=0.0155]. Additionally, the safety analysis demonstrated that AEVI-001 was well tolerated at all doses and the majority of adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity. There were no serious adverse events.
 
Our subsequent analysis of responder data from a subset of genomically identified patients in the SAGA trial identified eight genes (genetic subset) that appeared to be predictive of a clinically meaningful and statistically significant response on the ADHD-RS scales and CGI-I scales. These genes include certain glutamate metabotropic receptors and neurodevelopmental genes that are found in approximately 10% of pediatric ADHD patients.
 
We believed that these results clarified a path forward for the continued development of AEVI-001 in ADHD. As a result, we initiated a Phase 2 trial (the ASCEND trial) during the third quarter of 2017 to confirm genetic responders to AEVI-001. On January 2, 2019, we announced that the ASCEND trial, a genomically-guided Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of orally-administered AEVI-001 (100 – 400 mg BID) in children aged 6 – 17 with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with an mGluR copy number variant (Part A) or without an mGluR copy number variant (Part B), did not achieve statistical significance on the primary endpoint of reduction of ADHD-RS in either Part A or Part B after 6 weeks of treatment with AEVI-001. AEVI-001 was safe and well tolerated. Reported adverse events were minimal and similar across both Part A and Part B treatment groups. Given the negative outcomes of the ASCEND trial, we have terminated the AEVI-001 program.
 
AEVI-004 (novel co-crystal version of AEVI-001)
 
In July 2018, we announced the receipt of positive feedback from the United States Food and Drug Administration, which we refer to as the FDA, on an improved version of AEVI-001, identified as AEVI-004.  
 
Following 2016 FDA regulatory guidance on co-crystalization of active drugs, we created a co-crystal of fasoracetam (AEVI-001) with enhanced physical and chemical properties. The new molecule, AEVI-004, has comparatively greater stability and a higher melting point than AEVI-001.  The molecule was engineered to maintain solubility, dissolution and pharmacokinetics substantially similar to AEVI-001.  
 
In July 2018, we announced the receipt of feedback from the FDA provisionally indicating that AEVI-004 is a co-crystal of AEVI-001 and eligible for new chemical entity (NCE) status. The FDA also provisionally indicated that existing toxicology and pathology studies would support clinical development with AEVI-004 with minimal preclinical bridging studies.

AEVI-004 is expected to have composition of matter patents extending to 2039 and should be listed as a NCE in the FDA Orange Book.
 
Given the negative outcomes of the ASCEND trial, there are no current clinical development plans for AEVI-004 in ADHD. However, the company is in discussions with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) regarding evaluating the potential anti-seizure activity of AEVI-004 in a preclinical model as part of the NIH Epilepsy Treatment Screening Program.
 
AEVI-002 (Anti-LIGHT Monoclonal Antibody)
 
AEVI-002, a first-in-class anti-LIGHT monoclonal antibody, or the Antibody, is in development for use in Pediatric Onset Crohn’s disease. Pediatric Onset Crohn’s disease has a more aggressive phenotype at younger ages. The genomic rationale for the use of anti-LIGHT antibody in Crohn’s disease was validated by CAG research showing the association to a loss of function mutation in decoy receptor 3 (DcR3).
 
In June 2016, we entered into a Clinical Development and Option Agreement, or the Development and Option Agreement, with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., or KHK, pursuant to which we acquired certain rights with respect to the development and potential commercialization of the Antibody. Under the Development and Option Agreement, we received an exclusive option for exclusive rights to develop products containing the Antibody, or an Antibody Licensed Product, exclusive rights to commercialize Antibody Licensed Product in various countries and to conduct various development activities with respect to the Antibody Licensed Product, including the conduct of a signal finding study testing the Antibody in Severe Pediatric Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease, or the Study. The terms of the Development and Option Agreement with KHK are more fully described under the section entitled “Licenses.”
 
A submission to reactivate the IND for AEVI-002 in Pediatric Crohn’s Disease was filed with the FDA in 2017 and has passed the 30-day waiting period. An 8-week Phase Ib proof-of-concept study has been initiated, with the goal of enrolling up to 12 patients with a Pediatric Onset Crohn’s disease diagnosis, with most patients being refractory to treatment with TNF-α inhibitors, with or without a DcR3 mutation. The endpoints of the trial will include endoscopic evaluation, Crohn’s Disease Activity Index ratings and safety. Initial data from the proof-of-concept study is expected by mid-year 2019, at the earliest, at which point we will make a determination on our option to license exclusive rights to the Antibody for further development. Active recruitment for the trial is underway, although the identification and recruitment of patients into the proof-of-concept study has been extremely challenging, and to date no patients have been enrolled. The ability to produce initial data by mid-year 2019 is highly dependent on timely recruiting; thus, continued difficulties in recruitment could cause an extended delay or an inability to deliver initial data for the program.
 
AEVI-005 (Monoclonal Antibody)
 
AEVI-005 is the second monoclonal antibody we are developing as part of our ongoing collaboration with KHK. We are studying AEVI-005 in an undisclosed ultra-orphan auto-immune pediatric disease. We initiated a preclinical research program with AEVI-005 in the second quarter of 2018.
Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to translate key scientific insights relating to underlying genomic drivers of disease into the development of effective and highly selective therapeutics. To execute our strategy, we intend to:

· | Advance our clinical candidate, AEVI-002, through clinical development. The second program arising out of our genomic research collaboration with CHOP is the development candidate AEVI-002, a first-in-class anti-LIGHT monoclonal antibody being developed for use in Pediatric Onset Crohn’s disease. An 8-week signal finding study at CHOP has been initiated with the intent of enrolling up to 12 patients with a Pediatric Onset Crohn’s disease diagnosis, with most subjects being refractory to treatment with TNF-α inhibitors. Initial data from the proof-of-concept study is expected by mid-year 2019, at the earliest, at which point we will make a determination on our option to license exclusive rights to the antibody for further development.

· | Leverage our strategic collaborations to continue to implement a genomic medicine driven approach to drug development. Our strategy is to work closely with our collaborators at CAG to identify populations of need with well-characterized, novel, genetically-defined targets. We then designate an actionable therapeutic development approach based upon the target and the biology and human pathophysiology of the relevant disease and likely clinical and regulatory pathways. The collaboration affords us with unique and proprietary insight into these diseases and allows us to better select therapeutic approaches.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Work with experienced third parties in the field of diagnostics. Because we often target genetic alterations that are detectable, companion diagnostics can be developed to identify these alterations. Once we have identified a target, we will initially use existing diagnostic tools to identify patient subsets that we believe will derive increased benefit from our product candidates. As we advance our targets clinically and determine the most important screening criteria, we will develop companion diagnostics as appropriate, with the help of technology partners, to identify patients and support registration and marketing of our product candidates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Opportunistically in-license and acquire novel therapies for the treatment of rare and orphan disease. We plan to leverage our clinical drug development expertise and our relationships in the rare and orphan diseases community to identify and in-license or acquire additional product candidates that we believe have the potential to become novel treatments for diseases with significant unmet medical needs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Potentially seek strategic collaborative relationships while maintaining flexibility in commercializing and maximizing the value of our development programs. We plan to develop and seek regulatory approval for multiple product candidates in our development pipeline. While we may develop these products independently, we still may enter into strategic relationships with biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to realize the full value of these products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In light of our decision to discontinue the AEVI-001 program in ADHD, our board of directors has commenced a review to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. These alternatives could include, among others, continuing to execute the Company’s business plan, issuing or transferring shares of our common stock or other equity securities, the license, sale or disposition of certain assets or programs, the formation of a joint venture, a strategic business combination, a transaction that results in private ownership or the sale of the Company, or some combination of these. There can be no assurance that the review of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction or that our board of directors will determine that continuing our current business operations is in the best interests of our stockholders.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our goals are to obtain, maintain, and enforce patent and trademark protection for our products, processes, methods, and other proprietary technologies, including the platform collaboration with CHOP and to preserve our trade secrets both in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our products, processes and methods that arise from our genomics platform collaboration with CHOP through a combination of contractual arrangements, trade secrets, patents, and trademarks both in the United States and abroad.
 
Our ability to compete depends on our ability to maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights and operating without infringing the intellectual property of others and our ability to enforce our licenses. Our business could be materially harmed, and we could be subject to liabilities, because of lawsuits brought by others against us or our licensors and licensees. We will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are an essential and material element of our business. Applications for patents and other intellectual property rights capable of being registered have been, and will be, filed in certain key jurisdictions. As we identify additional rare and orphan disease targets, we will seek protection for the related intellectual property rights in the United States and other relevant jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the pending applications will result in patents ultimately being issued.
 
Our patent portfolio for AEVI-001, AEVI-002 and AEVI-005 consists of licensed patents and patent applications. The applicable licenses are discussed below.
 
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary knowledge and experience that is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, collaborators, advisors, customers and other third parties to protect our interests. To this end, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials. We intend to continue to take all appropriate steps to protect our intellectual property, including maintaining an active program for patent protection for novel elements in the development of our products and technology.

Licenses
 
CHOP License Agreement and Sponsored Research Agreement
 
In November 2014, we entered into a license agreement, or the License Agreement, and a sponsored research agreement, or the Research Agreement, each with CHOP. Under the terms of the License Agreement, CHOP granted us (i) an exclusive, sublicensable license to use certain patent rights covering potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets and (ii) an exclusive, non-sublicensable license to use certain biospecimen and phenotypic data collected from patients with rare and orphan diseases and their family members, or the Biobank. In February 2017, we amended the License Agreement. The amendment allows us to extend the period of our exclusive commercial access to the Biobank for rolling two-year periods. The cost of the first extension was $197,603 with each subsequent extension costing $125,000. We have exercised such option in each of 2017 and 2018. The amendment also (1) granted us the first right to defend challenges to the patent rights licensed under the License Agreement, (2) clarified termination rights in favor of CHOP if we enter liquidation, have a receiver or administrator appointed over any assets related to the License Agreement, make any voluntary assignment of our assets for the benefit of creditors, cease to carry on business, file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the US Bankruptcy Code or have an involuntary petition under Chapter 7 of the US Bankruptcy Code filed against us and (3) added a provision that tolls the right to terminate the License Agreement for default until completion of dispute resolutions proceedings concerning the alleged default and any remaining cure period, if any.
 
In December 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Research Agreement, which amendment (i) set the payment schedule under such agreement through March 2017 and (ii) granted us the right to extend the term of the Research Agreement until November 12, 2017. In February 2017, we entered into a second amendment to the Research Agreement, which extended the term of the Research Agreement through June 30, 2018. This amendment also granted us rights to continually extend the term of the Research Agreement by one year by giving CHOP written notice of extension no later than one year prior to the expiration of the then-current term of the Research Agreement. In June 2017, we extended the term of the Research Agreement through June 30, 2019, and in June 2018, we extended the term of Research Agreement through June 30, 2020.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, $5.94 million was due under the Research Agreement and $4.75 million will be due under the Research Agreement in 2019. In the first half of 2020, $2.38 million will be due under Research Agreement.
 
On March 25, 2019, we and CHOP agreed to, and on March 29, 2019 we and CHOP entered into definitive agreements to, further amend the Research Agreement and the License Agreement, or the CHOP Amendments. The CHOP Amendments allow us to defer the monthly payments due under the Research Agreement for the period from February 1, 2019 through September 30, 2019 in exchange for a non-interest bearing note in the amount of such deferral. Such note matures September 30, 2019 and is secured by all of Aevi’s intellectual property and other assets, or the Note.   At maturity, and at CHOP’s option, the Note will be payable in cash or a number of shares of our common stock calculated based on the price of our common stock at such time; provided, however, if conversion upon such election would cause CHOP and its affiliates including the CHOP Foundation to own, in the aggregate, in excess of 47.5% of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock (after giving effect to such conversion), then CHOP would only receive the number of shares of our common stock such that CHOP and its affiliates including the CHOP Foundation would own, in the aggregate, 47.5% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock (after giving effect to such conversion), and the balance of the Note would be payable to CHOP in cash.  
 
The CHOP Amendments with respect to the Research Agreement and the License Agreement prohibits the assignment or sublicense of CHOP’s intellectual property without CHOP’s prior written consent, allows CHOP to terminate the Research Agreement and the License Agreement upon a change of control without CHOP’s prior written consent, reduces the period of time during which we have to exercise its options to license new intellectual property of CHOP and to negotiate the terms of any such license and requires us to meet certain diligence requirements related to acquiring rights to and commencing a clinical trial for a viable molecule that addresses the optioned intellectual property.   
 
Furthermore, we have agreed that until and including June 23, 2019 the Company will not undertake any equity financing (including convertible notes) that would have a dilutive effect on the stockholders of Aevi.  Thereafter, and until the later of repayment in full of the Note or June 30, 2020, Aevi has agreed to only undertake an equity financing (including convertible notes) if the net proceeds of such financing provide at least six month of cash to sustain our operations; provided, that CHOP will have a right of first refusal to purchase any or all equity proposed to be issued in such financing on equivalent terms.

Development and Option Agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK) related to AEVI-002
 
In June 2016, we entered into the Development and Option Agreement with KHK pursuant to which we acquired certain rights with respect to the development and potential commercialization of AEVI-002.
 
Regarding AEVI-002, if we exercise our option under the Development and Option Agreement, KHK has 60 days to select one of two development and commercialization structures as follows:
 
PLAN A (AEVI-002): Co-Development/Co-Commercialization Arrangement
 
If KHK selects the co-development/co-commercialization arrangement (Plan A), we will have the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Antibody Licensed Products in the treatment, prevention, and diagnosis of specified pediatric onset rare and orphan inflammatory diseases (including severe pediatric onset inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, or IBD) and other specified pediatric onset rare and orphan auto-immune diseases, or collectively, the Field, in the United States and Canada. We will also be responsible for development and regulatory approval of the first Antibody Licensed Product in the European Union and then transferring such regulatory approval to KHK or its designee. We will be responsible for the manufacture of the Antibody Licensed Products for use by the parties in clinical trials as well as for commercialization in their respective fields and/or territories, with KHK purchasing the Antibody Licensed Products from us.
 
We will be required to pay KHK an initial license fee in the low single-digit millions of dollars upon the co-development/co-commercialization arrangement becoming effective. We may pay KHK up to an additional $18 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones related to the Antibody Licensed Products. The parties will share the anticipated costs of development of the first Antibody Licensed Product in the Field in the United States, Canada and the European Union with us being responsible for any costs in excess of an agreed cap. The parties will split profits from our sales of Antibody Licensed Products in the United States and Canada equally. KHK will pay us low double-digit royalties for sales of Antibody Licensed Products outside the United States and Canada and outside the Field in the United States and Canada.
 
PLAN B (AEVI-002): Licensing Arrangement
 
If KHK selects the licensing arrangement (Plan B), we will have the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Antibody Licensed Products in the Field in the United States, Canada and the European Union. We will be responsible for the manufacture of the Antibody Licensed Products for use by the parties in clinical trials as well as for commercialization in their respective fields and/or territories.
 
We will be required to pay KHK an initial license fee in the low single-digit millions of dollars upon the licensing arrangement becoming effective. We may pay KHK up to an additional $28 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones related to the Antibody Licensed Products. The parties will split profits from our sales of Antibody Licensed Products in the United States, Canada and the European Union with us being entitled to approximately 74% of such profits and KHK being entitled to approximately 26% of such profits. KHK will pay us low double-digit royalties for sales of Antibody Licensed Products outside the United States, Canada and the European Union and outside the Field in the United States, Canada and the European Union. We will be responsible for costs of development of Licensed Products in the United States, Canada and the European Union. KHK will have the right to purchase the Antibody Licensed Products from us.
 
Research Collaboration and Option Agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK) related to AEVI-005
 
During 2018, we expanded our collaboration with KHK by entering a Research Collaboration and Option Agreement related to AEVI-005. AEVI-005 is the second monoclonal antibody we are developing as part of our ongoing collaboration with KHK. We are studying AEVI-005 in an undisclosed ultra-orphan auto-immune pediatric disease. We initiated a preclinical research program with AEVI-005 in the second quarter of 2018.

Trademarks
 
Certain names utilized for our products and tools are trademarked, and certain names utilized for our products and tools are the subject of trademark registrations and applications in certain jurisdictions. The final choice of names for products and tools has not yet been made and will be subject to marketing considerations and other factors.
 
There can be no assurance that a third party will not oppose any registration, that the respective Trademark Offices will issue a registration certificate or that we will otherwise be successful in perfecting trademark rights for the marks in the United States or in foreign countries, the results of any of which would likely have a material adverse effect on our company.
 
Government Regulation
 
General
 
The production, distribution, and marketing of products employing our technology, and our development activities, are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States and in other countries. In the United States, our products are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, or FDCA, and the regulations of the FDA, as well as to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. These laws, and similar laws outside the United States, govern the research, clinical and preclinical testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, distribution, sale, import, export, storage, record-keeping, reporting, advertising, and promotion of our products. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, we anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing of, our products in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework, if successful, will take many years and involve the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences, including the FDA’s and other regulatory health agencies’ delay in approving or refusal to approve a product. Violations of regulatory requirements also may result in enforcement actions.
 
The following paragraphs provide further information on certain legal and regulatory issues with a particular potential to affect our operations or future marketing of products employing our technology.
 
FDA Approval Process
 
To obtain approval of a new product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data demonstrating the product’s safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate. In most cases, this entails extensive laboratory tests and preclinical and clinical trials. This testing and the preparation of necessary applications and processing of those applications by the FDA are expensive and typically take many years to complete. The FDA may deny our applications or may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing any products we may develop. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if we encounter problems following initial marketing. With respect to patented products or technologies, delays imposed by the governmental approval process may materially reduce the period during which we may have the exclusive right to exploit the products or technologies.

Currently all of our product candidates as well as other therapies we are exploring, regardless of therapeutic modality, will be considered to be a drug or biologic from a regulatory standpoint. The process required by the FDA before a new drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

· | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests or studies and formulation studies in compliance with good laboratory practices, or GLP, and other regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for a new drug or biologic, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with federal regulations and with current Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | detailed information on product characterization and manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the investigational product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for a drug or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for a biologic;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | review and approval of an NDA or a BLA.
--+----------------------------------------

 
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry formulation and stability, as well as animal and other studies to evaluate toxicity. Under FDA regulations, the results of any pre-clinical testing, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Additionally, for certain pediatric products, the sponsor may be required to submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (discussed below) as a pre-IND submission. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin, in order to ensure that human research patients will not be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period or at any time thereafter, the FDA may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials, may authorize trials only on specified terms, or may require additional trials. The IND process may become extremely costly and substantially delay development of our products. Moreover, positive results of pre-clinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in clinical trials.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols that detail, among other things, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be reviewed, approved and conducted under the auspices of an IRB. The sponsor, investigators, and IRB must, as applicable, obtain the informed written consent of each participating subject, comply with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitor the clinical trial, and timely report adverse events.

The sponsor typically conducts human clinical trials in three sequential phases, which may overlap. These phases generally include the following:
 

· | Phase 1: The product candidate is usually first introduced into healthy humans or, on occasion, into patients with the target disease or condition, and is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, excretion and metabolism;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2: The product candidate is introduced into a limited patient population to:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | assess its efficacy in specific, targeted indications;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and
--+------------------------------------------------


· | identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3: These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. If a product candidate is found to have an acceptable safety profile and to be potentially effective in Phase 2 clinical trials, clinical trials in Phase 3 will be initiated to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded and diverse patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites; and

· | If the FDA does ultimately approve the product candidate, it may require post-marketing testing, including potentially expensive Phase 4 studies, to confirm or further evaluate its safety and effectiveness. Continued ability to commercialize the product may be based on the successful completion of these additional studies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Before proceeding with a trial, the sponsor may seek a written agreement from the FDA regarding the design, size, and conduct of a clinical trial. This is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. Among other things, SPAs can cover clinical trials for pivotal studies whose data will form the primary basis to establish a product’s efficacy. SPAs thus help establish up-front concurrence with the FDA about the adequacy of a clinical trial design to support a regulatory approval, but the agreement is not binding if new circumstances arise. Even if the FDA agrees to a SPA, the agreement may be changed by the sponsor or the FDA on written agreement by either parties, or if a senior FDA official determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product was identified after the testing began. There is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval, even if the study is subject to a SPA. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of the SPA and the data and results from any study that is the subject of the SPA.
 
Pediatric product development is subject to additional FDA regulations, including the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act, as amended by the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, which may impact whether FDA grants orphan designation for pediatric subpopulations of common diseases (discussed below) and could require pediatric studies. Sponsors may be required to submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP) before the initiation of any phase 3 studies unless certain exemptions apply. Where a sponsor is required to submit an iPSP, the sponsor must reach an agreement with FDA before submitting a marketing application or supplement. FDA agreement on a iPSP does not guarantee that the study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval.
 
The FDA or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. Data safety monitoring committees, which monitor certain studies to protect the welfare of study patients, may also require that a clinical trial be discontinued or modified. In addition, there are requirements for the registration of certain ongoing clinical trials of product candidates on public registries and the disclosure of certain information pertaining to the trials as well as clinical trial results after completion. In the United States, sponsors are required to register this information on a website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, at www.clinicaltrials.gov.

The sponsor must submit to the FDA the results of the pre-clinical and clinical trials, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacturing and composition of the product, and proposed labeling, in the form of an NDA, or, in the case of a biologic, a BLA. The applicant must also submit with the NDA or BLA a substantial user fee payment, unless a waiver or reduction applies. In some cases, a sponsor may be able to expand the indications in an approved NDA or BLA through a submission of a Prior Approval Supplement. Each NDA or BLA submitted for FDA approval is usually reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following submission of the application. If deemed complete, the FDA will “file” the NDA or BLA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA will review the application and will usually respond to the applicant in accordance with performance goals the FDA has established for the review of NDAs and BLAs - six months from the receipt of the application for priority applications and ten to twelve months for regular applications. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information, pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, clarification, or a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or by changes to the application submitted by the applicant in the form of amendments. The FDA may refer applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will often inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities are in compliance with current cGMP requirements which govern the manufacture, holding and distribution of a product.
 
It is possible that our product candidates will not successfully proceed through this approval process or that the FDA will not approve them in any specific period of time, or at all. The FDA may deny or delay approval of applications that do not meet applicable regulatory criteria, or if the FDA determines that the clinical data does not adequately establish the safety and efficacy of the product. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements for a new product candidate is a process that may take a number of years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. The FDA reviews these applications and, when and if it decides that adequate data is available to show that the product is both safe and effective and that other applicable requirements have been met, approves the product candidate for marketing. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and imposes costly procedures upon our activities. Success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Upon approval, a product candidate may be marketed only for those indications approved in the NDA or BLA and will be subject to labeling and promotional requirements or limitations, including warnings, precautions, contraindications and use limitations, which could materially impact profitability. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-market regulatory standards and requirements are not maintained or if safety, efficacy or other problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace.
 
The FDA may, during its review of an NDA or BLA, ask for additional study data. If the FDA does ultimately approve the product, approval may be subject to limitations based on the FDA’s interpretation of the existing pre-clinical and clinical data and the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including potentially expensive Phase 4 studies, to confirm or otherwise further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product. The FDA also may require, as a condition to approval or continued marketing of a drug, a REMS to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biologic product outweigh its risks. REMS can include additional educational materials for healthcare professionals and patients such as Medication Guides and Patient Package Inserts, a plan for communicating information to healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU, such as restricted distribution of the product. In addition, the FDA may, in some circumstances, impose restrictions on the use of the product, which may be difficult and expensive to administer and may require prior approval of promotional materials. Following approval, the FDA may require labeling changes or impose new post-approval study, risk management, or distribution restriction requirements.
 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, became law. The Cures Act contains numerous provisions, including provisions designed to speed development of innovative therapies and encourage greater use of real-world evidence to support regulatory decision making for drugs.

The FDA has developed four distinct approaches intended to make drugs that address unmet medical needs for serious or life-threatening conditions available as rapidly as possible, especially when the drugs are the first available treatment or have advantages over existing treatments: accelerated approval, fast track, breakthrough therapy, and priority review. The FDA requires a manufacturer who receives certain designations to make publicly available its policy for responding to requests for individual patient expanded access.
 

· | Accelerated Approval. The FDA may grant “accelerated approval” status to drugs or biologics that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. Under this pathway, the FDA may approve a product based on surrogate endpoints, or clinical endpoints other than survival or irreversible morbidity. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct additional post-approval clinical trials to verify and describe clinical benefit. Under the agency’s accelerated approval regulations, if the FDA concludes that a product that has been shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require certain post-marketing restrictions as necessary to assure safe use. In addition, for products approved under accelerated approval, sponsors will be required to submit all copies of their promotional materials, including advertisements, to the FDA at least thirty days prior to initial dissemination unless otherwise informed by the FDA. After a hearing, the FDA may withdraw a previously granted accelerated approval if, for instance, post-marketing studies fail to verify any clinical benefit, it becomes clear that restrictions on the distribution of the product are inadequate to ensure its safe use, or if a sponsor fails to comply with the conditions of the accelerated approval.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Breakthrough Therapy. The FDA may grant “breakthrough therapy” status to drugs or biologics designed to treat, alone or in combination with another drug(s) or biologic(s), a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and for which preliminary evidence suggests a substantial improvement on clinically-meaningful endpoints over existing therapies. Such products need not address an unmet need, but are nevertheless eligible for expedited review if they offer the potential for an improvement over existing therapies. Breakthrough therapy status entitles the sponsor to earlier and more frequent meetings with the FDA regarding the development of nonclinical and clinical data and permits the FDA to offer product development or regulatory advice for the purpose of shortening the potential time to product approval. Breakthrough therapy status does not guarantee that a product will be developed or reviewed more quickly and does not ensure FDA approval.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fast Track. The FDA may grant “fast track” status to drugs or biologics that treat serious diseases or illness and fill an unmet medical need. Fast track is a process designed to expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product’s development plan, more frequent written correspondence from the FDA about trial design, eligibility for accelerated approval if certain criteria are met, and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of a NDA or BLA for the FDA’s review before the entire filing is completed. Fast track status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval more quickly, if at all.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Priority Review. The FDA may grant “priority review” status to products that, if approved, would be significant improvements in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Priority review is intended to reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review a NDA or BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Additionally, there are various designations available to drugs and biologics which provide a sponsor with incentives to support approval of the product candidate, including, but is not limited to, orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation.
 

-11-

Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, as amended by the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which is defined as having a prevalence of less than 200,000 individuals in the United States. FDA is currently implementing a modernization plan which may include new requirements or procedures that could impact the success of an orphan drug designation request. In certain circumstances, a sponsor may need to demonstrate that the product is clinically superior to a previously-approved drug in order to obtain orphan drug status, and FDA may issue regulations to implement this requirement. These regulations will also affect Rare Pediatric Disease Designation Requests, which were previously exempted from the clinical trial requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity Act; FDA may now require clinical studies in pediatric populations for these requests to obtain orphan drug designation. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a NDA or BLA for the product. The FDA aims to respond to all orphan drug designation requests within 90 days of submission. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the regulatory review and approval process, nor does it provide any advantage in the regulatory review and approval process. However, if an orphan drug later receives approval for the indication for which it has designation, the relevant regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years in the United States. Although obtaining approval to market a product with orphan drug exclusivity may be advantageous, we cannot be certain:

· | that we will be the first to obtain approval for any drug for which we obtain orphan drug designation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | that orphan drug designation will result in any commercial advantage or reduce competition; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | that the limited exceptions to this exclusivity will not be invoked by the relevant regulatory authority.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Additionally, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost under certain conditions, such as if the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug.
 
In August 2017, President Trump signed into law the Food & Drug Administration Reauthorization Act. This legislation imposes significant new requirements for clinical trial sponsors which will affect, among other things, obtaining orphan drug designation, and the development of drugs and biological products for pediatric use.
 
Ongoing FDA Requirements and Post-Marketing Obligations
 
The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 expanded FDA authority over drug products after approval. All approved drug products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, sampling and distribution requirements, notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, submitting periodic reports to the FDA, maintaining and providing updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, criminal prosecution, or civil penalties.
 
The FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials to develop additional information regarding the safety of a product. These studies or trials may involve continued testing of a product and development of data, including clinical data, about the product’s effects in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. The FDA may require post-marketing studies or trials to investigate possible or known serious risks or signals of serious risks, or to identify unexpected serious risks, and may require periodic status reports if new safety information develops. Failure to conduct these studies in a timely manner may result in substantial civil fines, or withdrawal of product approval.
 

-12-
----

 

Also, newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, or even in some instances, withdrawal of the approval. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage, including after approval, may result in various adverse consequences, including the FDA’s withdrawal of an approved product from the market, other voluntary or FDA-initiated action that could delay or restrict further marketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties against the manufacturer and NDA or BLA holder. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA or BLA holder, including withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product also must be in compliance with FDA requirements which include, among others, promotional activities, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, promotional activities involving the internet, and industry sponsored scientific and educational activities. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, all product promotion must be consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA for such product, contain a balanced presentation of information on the product’s uses, benefits, risks, and important safety information and limitations on use, and otherwise not be false or misleading. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing a company to correct deviations from regulatory standards and enforcement actions that can include seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions also may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, as well as state authorities. This could subject the company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes its products. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, state and federal fraud and abuse and consumer protection laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.
 
Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and to list their products with the FDA. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities in the United States and abroad in order to assure compliance with the applicable cGMP regulations and other requirements. Facilities also are subject to inspections by other federal, foreign, state or local agencies. In complying with the cGMP regulations, manufacturers must continue to assure that the product meets applicable specifications, regulations and other post-marketing requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing or recall or seizure of product.
 
Sponsors and their third-party contractors are also subject to various laws and regulations governing laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with their research. In each of the above areas, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and deny or withdraw approvals.
 
Furthermore, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development, or effect the conditions under which approved products are marketed.
 
Potential Competition with “Biosimilar” Products
 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act. The BPCIA authorizes the FDA to approve “abbreviated” BLAs for products whose sponsors demonstrate they are “biosimilar” to reference products previously approved under BLAs. The FDA may also separately determine whether “biosimilar” products are “interchangeable” with their reference products. However, the FDA may not approve an “abbreviated” BLA for a biosimilar product until at least twelve years after the date on which the BLA for the reference product was approved. FDA approval could be further delayed if the reference products are subject to unexpired and otherwise valid patents.

-13-
----

 

Prior to the enactment of the BPCIA, information in approved BLAs could not be relied upon by other manufacturers to establish the safety and efficacy of their products for which they were seeking FDA approval. (In contrast, since at least 1984, pharmaceutical manufacturers have been able to submit Abbreviated New Drug Applications for “generic drugs” that are materially identical to reference drugs approved under NDAs.) Accordingly, if our products are approved under a BLA, other manufacturers potentially could develop and seek FDA approval of “biosimilar” products at some point in the future.
 
In Vitro Companion Diagnostics
 
FDA defines an In Vitro, or IVD, companion diagnostic device as an in vitro diagnostic device that provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. The use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product is stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product, including the label. Such tests include genetic diagnostic tests. Approval of such of treatment with the therapeutic product may be dependent on the approval of an IVD to:

· | Monitor response to treatment with the therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment (e.g., schedule, dose, discontinuation) to achieve improved safety or effectiveness; and/or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identify patients in the population for whom the therapeutic product has been adequately studied and found safe and effective, i.e., there is insufficient information about the safety and effectiveness of the therapeutic product in any other population.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Applications for an IVD companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic product will be reviewed and approved according to applicable regulatory requirements. The IVD companion diagnostic device application will be reviewed and approved or cleared under the device authorities of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and relevant medical device regulations; the therapeutic product application will be reviewed and approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act (i.e., drug products) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (i.e., biological products) and relevant drug and biological product regulations. FDA intends to review each IVD companion diagnostic device submission within the context of, or in conjunction with, its corresponding therapeutic product, and FDA review of the IVD companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product will be carried out collaboratively among relevant FDA offices.
 
Ideally, a therapeutic product and its corresponding IVD companion diagnostic device should be developed contemporaneously, with the clinical performance and clinical significance of the IVD companion diagnostic device established using data from the clinical development program of the corresponding therapeutic product. Many of our current and future product development candidates, including AEVI-002, may depend upon co-development of accurate genetic and potentially other IVDs. Thus, we will likely need to comply with both FDA drug and medical device regulations. This adds additional cost and complexity to our development programs. The availability of IVD companion diagnostics can allow more efficient development programs and more appropriate use of products in the marketplace with more predictable outcomes for patients and higher value medicines.
 
Ultimately FDA approval of the IVD will be required to allow approval of many of our products. However, technical difficulties or other issues could delay or disrupt the development of our products.
 
HIPAA Requirements
 
Other federal legislation may affect our ability to obtain certain health information in conjunction with our research activities. We may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”— independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. The 21st Century Cares Act, Pub. L. 114-255, signed into law on December 13, 2016, among other changes, directs HHS to issue new HIPAA guidance which might differ from current regulations. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements
 
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biologic products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the DOJ and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, and similar state laws, each as amended.
 
If a drug or biologic product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicare Modernization Act as well as the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, or OBRA, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA, each as amended. Among other things, the OBRA imposes certain reporting requirements on pharmaceutical manufacturers and requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on prescription products to state Medicaid programs and empowers states to negotiate rebates on pharmaceutical prices, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the VHCA, drug companies are required to offer some products at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and some private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicaid. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws.
 
In March 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, which substantially changes the way healthcare will be financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act was a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Affordable Care Act has resulted in downward pressure on coverage and the price of products covered by Medicare and other government programs. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments and coverage from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act, and there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the under the current administration. Further legislation to repeal or revise Affordable Care Act, if enacted, may have a significant impact on the health care system.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
 
Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. The False Statements Statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to certain health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers
 
The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and public reporting of the payment data. Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to track such payments, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year.
 
Moreover, we are subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we potentially could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity (e.g., a healthcare provider or a health plan) in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.

Foreign Regulatory Requirements
 
We may be subject to widely varying foreign regulations, which may be quite different from those of the FDA, governing clinical trials, manufacturing, product registration and approval, pharmaceutical sales and data protection.
 
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, we must obtain a separate approval for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the commencement of product marketing in these countries. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
In addition, pharmaceutical products may not be imported into, or manufactured or marketed in, the State of Israel absent drug registration or the appropriate license/approval to import/manufacture for clinical trials use.
 
Reimbursement and Pricing Controls
 
Third-party payers (Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance companies and other organizations) may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of our product candidates by regulating the level of reimbursement provided to the physicians and clinic utilizing our product candidates or by refusing reimbursement. If reimbursement under these programs, or if the amount of time to secure reimbursement is too long, our ability to market our technology and product candidates may be adversely and materially affected. In international markets, reimbursement by private third-party medical insurance providers, including government insurers and independent providers, varies from country to country. In certain countries, our ability to achieve significant market penetration may depend upon the availability of third-party government reimbursement.
 
In many of the markets where we or our collaborative partners would commercialize a product following regulatory approval, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject, by law, to direct price controls and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. Public and private health care payers control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including the setting of reimbursement amounts for drugs and biological products covered by Medicare Part B based on their Average Sales Prices calculated by manufacturers in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 108-173 (2003), as amended, through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers, and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Drug manufacturers also may be subject to drug rebate agreements with public or private health care payers in exchange for the manufacturers’ products being included on plan formularies.
 
Payers also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. If a payer concludes that a drug is experimental or investigational, in many cases it will deny coverage on that basis alone. Further, many public and private health care payers limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA or that are supported by other appropriate evidence (for example, published medical literature) and appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA. For example, in the case of Medicare coverage for physician-administered oncology drugs, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, with certain exceptions, prohibits Medicare carriers from refusing to cover unapproved uses of an FDA-approved drug if the unapproved use is supported by one or more citations in the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information the American Medical Association Drug Evaluations, or the United States Pharmacopoeia Drug Information. Another commonly cited compendium, for example under Medicaid, is the DRUGDEX Information System.
