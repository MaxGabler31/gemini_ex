History
Lear was founded in Detroit in 1917 as American Metal Products, a manufacturer of seating assemblies and other components for the automotive and aircraft industries, and was incorporated in Delaware in 1987. Through a management-led buyout in 1988, Lear Corporation established itself as a privately-held seat assembly operation for the North American automobile market with annual sales of approximately $900 million. We completed an initial public offering in 1994 and developed into a global supplier through organic growth and a series of acquisitions.
In May 1999, we acquired UT Automotive, Inc. ("UT Automotive") from United Technologies Corporation. UT Automotive was a leading supplier of automotive electrical distribution systems. The acquisition of UT Automotive represented our entry into automotive electrical and electronic systems and was the basis for our current E-Systems segment. 
We have subsequently augmented our internal growth plans with selective acquisitions and investments to expand our component capabilities and global footprint, as well as expand our technology portfolio:
•In May 2012, we acquired Guilford Mills, a leading supplier of automotive seat and interior fabric, for approximately $243 million.
•In January 2015, we acquired Everett Smith Group, Ltd., the parent company of Eagle Ottawa, LLC ("Eagle Ottawa"), the world's leading provider of leather for the automotive industry, for approximately $844 million.
•In August 2015, we acquired intellectual property and technology from Autonet Mobile, a developer of wireless communication software and devices for automotive applications.
•In November 2015, we acquired Arada Systems Inc., an automotive technology company that specializes in vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure (together, "V2X") communications.
•In April 2017, we acquired Grupo Antolin's automotive seating business for approximately $292 million.
•In January 2018, we acquired Israel-based EXO Technologies, a leading developer of differentiated GPS technology providing high-accuracy positioning solutions for autonomous and connected vehicle applications.
•In January 2019, we launched Lear Innovation Ventures ("LIV") to supplement our internal innovation efforts. LIV provides us with a framework to invest in advanced development teams, partnerships and early stage technologies by working with venture capital firms, accelerators and incubators. LIV also makes direct capital investments in start-ups and internal innovation initiatives.
•In April 2019, we acquired Xevo Inc. ("Xevo"), a Seattle-based, global leader in connected car software, for approximately $322 million. Xevo is a supplier of software solutions for the cloud, vehicles and mobile devices that are deployed in millions of vehicles worldwide.
•In March 2021, we acquired M&N Plastics, an injection molding specialist and manufacturer of engineered plastic components for automotive electrical distribution applications.
•In October 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of Kongsberg Automotive's Interior Comfort Systems business unit ("Kongsberg") for approximately €175 million. Kongsberg specializes in comfort seating solutions, including massage, lumbar, seat heat and ventilation. The acquisition, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and adjustments, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.
Environmental, Social and Governance
At Lear, we recognize the importance of environmental, social and governance ("ESG") considerations to our investors, as well as employees, customers and other stakeholders. Responsible and sustainable ESG principles and practices are integrated into our corporate strategy and operations. Our ESG strategy and initiatives are developed by a cross-functional team of senior subject matter experts, reviewed and approved by senior management and overseen by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors. We are continuously working to embed ESG principles into our key business processes, including corporate strategy, enterprise risk management, product and process development and innovation, procurement and sales. We actively communicate our goals and activities to our investors in our public disclosures available on our website and in our SEC filings. Our ESG efforts demonstrate how we live our core value to Get Results the Right Way, and in 2020, we reinforced this commitment by becoming a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact.
Energy Efficiency and Carbon Reduction Efforts at Lear
•How We Are Driving Sustainability in Our Production Processes
We employ standardized production processes globally that are designed to drive the efficient use of energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the prevention of pollution and the utilization of safe and sustainable production processes. During 2020, we published ambitious carbon reduction goals that we intend to achieve by 2030, including 100% usage of renewable energy for our electricity consumption and a 50% reduction in carbon emissions at our manufacturing facilities, as well as an aspiration to be carbon neutral by 2050.
We are implementing a multifaceted approach to achieve these goals that involves the procurement and on-site generation of renewable energy, where practicable, and efforts to reduce energy consumption and use energy more efficiently in our operations. We are in the process of developing a comprehensive global renewable energy strategy for future energy purchases that we anticipate will consist of power purchase agreements to support new renewable energy projects and the purchase of energy attribution certificates from energy providers, whether bundled with existing energy purchases or unbundled where that is the only option for a given region.
In 2021, we released our Energy Efficiency Playbook into our operations to institutionalize best practices regarding energy usage. We have also updated our facilities' specifications for new construction and significant building refurbishments to require more energy efficient systems, such as heating and cooling, wherever practicable. Examples of ongoing energy efficiency projects include:
–Conducting energy audits and energy savings treasure hunts;
–Installing leakage detection devices to detect heat/energy losses from operating equipment;
–Automating plant-wide ventilation systems;
–Replacing legacy light fixtures with LEDs; and
–Recycling previously wasted heated streams of air and water.
While the foregoing efforts will help us drive toward the elimination of carbon emissions in those areas we can control (Scope 1 and 2 emissions), we are also progressing toward our longer-term overall goal of carbon neutrality across our value chain (including Scope 3 emissions). Accordingly, we are working to measure our Scope 3 emissions through the development of product life-cycle assessments for our major product offerings. We anticipate that a significant portion of our Scope 3 emissions will be reduced over time as our customers shift to producing more electric vehicles that do not rely on gasoline-powered engines. In terms of our supply chain, we are commencing efforts to communicate both our own carbon goals and our expectation of our suppliers as to sustainable energy usage going forward.
•How We Are Responding to Increased Calls for Product Sustainability
We continue to believe that light vehicle production will remain the single most important factor impacting our financial success in the foreseeable future. As outlined elsewhere in this Report, there are numerous factors impacting light vehicle production. In particular, the automotive industry is under increased focus to develop more sustainable transportation solutions. Our line of products for the automotive industry remain foundational for almost all types of light vehicles currently under consideration for near- and mid-term production whether reliant upon the internal combustion engine or alternative, more sustainable drivetrain technologies. 
Environmental concerns generally, as well as changes to the environment caused by carbon dioxide and other emissions and byproducts specifically, are significantly impacting the transportation industry as governments, non-governmental organizations, investors, product consumers and other stakeholders seek to balance global transportation needs with environmental concerns. Continued focus on climate change and environmental sustainability is increasing the expectations, and in some cases, leading to regulatory requirements, that the automotive industry utilize cleaner, more fuel-efficient solutions. In addition, we believe that for consumers, the advantages of cleaner air, energy efficiency and potentially lower maintenance will make electric vehicles an increasingly popular choice over time. Many of our product offerings are designed to capitalize on these evolving regulatory requirements and consumer preferences, such as on-board battery chargers, battery management systems, and electrical distribution and connection systems designed for high-voltage applications. Additionally, our intelligent and reconfigurable seats and electronic modules enhance connectivity and support the trend of shared mobility.
Our stakeholders' focus on sustainability also means that our continued successful participation in the automotive industry will depend on our ability to continue developing products that are more environmentally sustainable. In this regard, our innovative products range from "green" products, such as SoyFoamTM, a substitute for certain petroleum-based products, to seat coverings made from recycled ocean plastics.
We are also committed to working with our suppliers and customers to source raw materials, including the leather that is used in the seats that we produce, in a sustainable manner. This includes protecting forests by eliminating purchases of cattle or hides produced by unsustainable cattle ranching methods that lead to deforestation and forest degradation. Our No Deforestation Policy aligns with industry standards and requires of our suppliers:
–Supply chain transparency, so that all materials supplied to us are from legal sources;
–Land is not clear-cut or burned for production or development; and
–Compliance with governmental laws, regulations and guidelines regarding deforestation.
With respect to the Amazon rainforest, 100% of our direct Brazilian leather suppliers use georeferencing technology to confirm that the farms from which they directly buy cattle or hides are not involved in deforestation, invasion of indigenous and protected areas, or human rights violations. To monitor our suppliers' compliance with these requirements, we may conduct audits and/or require third-party verification.
Other ESG-Related Initiatives
We are especially proud of our employee efforts to support our global communities, such as our employee volunteer-driven educational campaign, "Focus on the Drive," to increase awareness and decrease the incidence of distracted driving. Through our Operation GIVE campaign at our Southfield, Michigan headquarters, more than $1 million in employee contributions benefited local programs focused on economic well-being, education and the environment in 2021.
Our commitment to human rights is set forth in our Human Rights Policy that clearly defines how we approach, govern and defend the dignity of people throughout our operations, our global supply chain and the communities in which we operate. In addition, our Together We Belong campaign helps fund initiatives that address racial inequality and discrimination through a combination of grants to external organizations, as well as internal investments to educate and engage our employees.
Our governance activities help ensure that our business and operations are conducted in compliance with all applicable laws, as well as Lear's policies and procedures, particularly our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which addresses conflicts of 
interest, bribery and corruption, political contributions and information technology security, among other things. Our Board of Directors, and its Audit and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees, oversee our compliance and governance activities. Our expectations related to conducting business in a sustainable and ethical manner extend to our supply base. Suppliers must meet the requirements of our Supplier Sustainability Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct. We monitor and assess their compliance both internally and through the use of a third party.
Human Capital Management
We believe that the best way to deliver the highest quality products and services is to maintain a work environment that prioritizes safety and fosters collaboration, inclusion, tolerance and respect for our 160,100 employees around the world.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our employment levels worldwide were approximately as follows:

Region | 2021 | 2020 
United States and Canada | 10,200 | 10,600 
Mexico | 47,500 | 55,200 
Central and South America | 19,700 | 20,900 
Europe and Africa | 55,100 | 56,500 
Asia | 27,600 | 31,400 
Total | 160,100 | 174,600

Our compensation and benefits strategy is designed to be competitive in the countries in which we operate to motivate our employees to perform to the best of their abilities, to achieve our objectives and to align the interests of our employees with the interests of our stakeholders. Our compensation package includes salary and both performance-based and long-term incentive programs, as appropriate for each role. We also provide a multitude of market-competitive benefits, which may include medical, life and disability insurance, contributory retirement savings plan, paid time off, paid parental leave and tuition reimbursement.
A substantial number of our employees are members of industrial trade unions or national trade organizations. We have collective bargaining agreements with several North American unions, including the United Auto Workers, Unifor, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and Workers United. In the United States and Canada, each of our unionized facilities has a separate collective bargaining agreement with the union that represents the workers at such facility, with each such agreement having an expiration date that is independent of the other agreements. The majority of our employees in Mexico and Europe are members of industrial trade union organizations or confederations within their respective countries. Many of these organizations and confederations operate under national contracts, which are not specific to any one employer. We have occasionally experienced labor disputes at our plants. We have been able to resolve all such labor disputes and believe that our relations with our employees are generally good.
See Item 1A, "Risk Factors — A significant labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could adversely affect our financial performance," and Part II — Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Forward-Looking Statements."
Ethics and Compliance
We are committed to conducting our business with integrity and in compliance with all applicable laws of the cities, states and countries in which we operate, and we have established a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to assist employees in this regard. We encourage employees to report concerns through a variety of channels, including a toll-free compliance and ethics line, an online form and a mobile app, each of which allows for anonymous reporting. Our ethics and compliance team reviews every report and, when appropriate, conducts an investigation. We also maintain an anti-retaliation policy such that any employee who reports a concern in good faith is protected from harassment, retaliation or adverse employment consequences.
Health and Safety
Our health and safety programs are designed around global standards with appropriate variations to address the multiple jurisdictions and unique working environments of our manufacturing operations. Our health and safety management system is compliant with the ISO 45001 standard, and we are currently implementing a more comprehensive program which combines ISO 14002 and 45001 requirements to improve efficiency and performance. Each of our locations performs regular safety audits to ensure that proper safety policies are in place and appropriate safety training is provided. In addition, we engage an independent third-party conformity assessment and certification vendor to audit selected operations for adherence to our global health and safety standards. 
In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we created a Safe Work Playbook, which provides a standardized approach for each of our facilities to create a consistent and safe work environment and offers insights into navigating operational challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The playbook is available to the public and includes health and safety information related to plant operating protocols; employee education, training and feedback; facility assessments; and phased reopening of engineering and administrative centers. To date, more than 35,000 copies of the Safe Work Playbook have been downloaded. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI")
We strive to build a culture of diversity and inclusion not only through our human resource policies and practices but also by actively working to eliminate discrimination and harassment in all of its forms. Since 2020, our employees have participated in over 125,000 hours of DEI and anti-harassment training. In addition, our global executives and U.S. managers at our Southfield, Michigan headquarters have completed our Connecting with Others DEI training, which helps our employees identify barriers to inclusion and learn behaviors that both promote inclusion and establish stronger connections. Our Together We Belong campaign continues to help our employees learn to navigate difficult conversations and support diverse colleagues. In 2021, we introduced Together We Grow, a merit-based program designed to help future diverse leaders grow at Lear. We are accomplishing this by investing in meaningful development and proactive career management for this group of high-potential diverse talent and being intentional in advancing and promoting this talent to "next-level" roles and leadership positions. The program provides significant training, an executive sponsor, career mapping and access to the senior leadership team. By focusing on engagement, this program will allow our next generation of leaders to maximize their full potential. We are also proud of our six Employee Resource Groups, representing 15 countries. These employee-led volunteer groups are open to all employees with a goal of fostering a culture where our diverse and global workforce feels engaged, accepted and valued.
Training and Talent Development
We are committed to the continued development of our employees. Since 2019, we have delivered more than 6 million hours of safety, development, leadership, quality, continuous improvement, lean manufacturing, and ISO and IATF certification training. Our Emerging Leaders Development Program is a twelve-month leadership and business course designed to develop high-potential managers and directors. Our CEO Academy is our premier leadership development opportunity. Twice per year, a select group of leaders representing diverse functions and backgrounds are invited to participate in a week-long leadership immersion event, during which each participant presents a bold business idea to help drive Lear's success. In addition, formal talent reviews and succession planning occur annually – globally and across all business areas. Senior leadership provides annual updates on succession and talent development to the Board of Directors.
Employee Engagement and Culture
Launched in 2017, Together We Win is Lear's global employee engagement program focused on driving cultural change in our operations. Plants advance through four segments — leadership, work environment, employee involvement and team empowerment. Together We Win unites hourly employees across the globe in achieving excellence based on key operations and employee engagement metrics, such as quality, absenteeism, health and safety performance, and operational efficiency. To help our plants along the journey, our proprietary playbook provides a roadmap of best practices, and engagement surveys give hourly employees a voice in measuring progress at each plant. 
Champions of Lear celebrates our global operations and our hourly and salaried employees who represent the best-of-the-best in our company. Individuals, teams or plants submit an application which is reviewed by a diverse panel of judges including Lear leadership. Award categories honor achievements in culture, customer appreciation, innovation, supply chain, quality, safety, operational excellence, continuous improvement, sustainability, best launch and best plant collaboration, as well as the prestigious CEO Special Appreciation Award. In 2021, an additional award category was added to recognize initiatives that support DEI in the workplace.
Industry and Strategy
We supply all vehicle segments of the automotive light vehicle original equipment market in every major automotive producing region in the world. Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the automotive manufacturers, which is ultimately dependent on the availability of raw materials and components and consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle. In 2020, unprecedented industry disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the first half of the year, impacted our operations in every region of the world. Although industry production increased 3% in 2021 over 2020, production remains well below recent historic levels and consumer demand. Production in the second half of 2021 decreased 16% relative to the second half of 2020. This was largely due to the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, particularly through supply shortages. The most significant supply shortage relates to semiconductor chips, which impacted global vehicle production and resulted in reductions and cancellations of planned production. In addition, we 
experienced increased costs related to labor shortages and inefficiencies and ongoing costs related to personal protective equipment, all of which are likely to continue for a period of time. Increases in certain commodity costs, as well as transportation and logistics costs, are also impacting, and will continue to impact, our operating results for the foreseeable future. Further, a resurgence of the COVID-19 virus or its variants, including corresponding "stay at home" or similar government orders impacting industry production, could impact our financial results.

The automotive industry, and our business, continue to be shaped by the broad trends of electrification, connectivity, autonomy and shared mobility. We also consider demand and regulatory developments for improved energy efficiency, sustainability, enhanced safety and communications (e.g., government mandates related to fuel economy, carbon emissions and safety equipment) to be significant drivers of these trends, each of which is likely to be at the forefront of our industry for the foreseeable future. 
•Electrification – Demand for more energy efficient vehicles is increasing, both from automotive manufacturers to meet governmental requirements and/or their own internal targets and from a growing segment of end consumers who wish to reduce the carbon impact of automobiles. This requires further use of electronically controlled and assisted powertrains and related components to improve fuel efficiency; the adoption of alternative energy powertrains, such as 48-volt mild hybrid, full hybrid, plug-in hybrid and pure battery electric, that facilitate electrification of the vehicle; and the use of lighter weight materials throughout the vehicle.
•Connectivity – Customer and consumer demands for continuous communication and information exchange with the vehicle are increasing. What began with consumer demand to extend and integrate mobile connectivity into the vehicle by connecting mobile devices with vehicle infotainment systems is evolving such that the vehicle has an 
embedded, direct line of wireless communication connecting it with various networks (e.g., cellular, infrastructure, satellite, etc.) and other vehicles. We expect these trends to continue, making the vehicle a constantly connected device, receiving and transmitting data through a variety of signals which communicate directly with on-board vehicle systems and facilitating delivery of content and services for consumers and automotive manufacturers.
•Autonomy - Customer and consumer demands are evolving from safety features and systems that protect vehicle occupants when a crash occurs to advanced driver assistance systems that help prevent crashes by assisting in the vehicle's operation under certain conditions. The development of automated intervention uses many of the same core technologies that will enable vehicles to drive autonomously under an increasing variety of driving conditions.
•Shared Mobility – As vehicle utilization increases and ride-sharing becomes more relevant, customer and consumer demands for more services, enhanced personalization, reconfigurability of the automotive interior and an improved mobility experience are also increasing.
The demand for electric vehicles is accelerating, driven by numerous product offerings from both traditional and non-traditional automotive manufacturers, government incentives and end consumers' desire to reduce the carbon impact of automobiles. Key attributes of seat design are evolving as the market pivots toward electric vehicles. This movement provides us with an opportunity to offer value added solutions to our customers through our Seating and E-Systems products and to use our leading market position to capture additional market share. These products include seat heating and cooling through INTUTM Thermal Comfort, the latest addition to our Intelligent Seating (INTUTM Seating) offerings, and seat reconfigurabily through Configurable Seating Architecture (ConfigurE+TM), as well as wire harness assemblies, including connection systems, and integrated power modules.
Through our products, technology and strategic initiatives, we are well positioned to capture business growth opportunities with respect to these trends and key drivers. We see a close link among these trends and expect the convergence of them to benefit both our Seating and E-Systems businesses. For example, we believe that autonomous vehicles will have seat designs and requirements that are far more flexible and demanding in both autonomous and piloted driving states. Further, more active monitoring of the driver's position and physical state will be required to manage the transitions between autonomous and piloted driving conditions.
A demand for mobility services and on-demand transportation from providers such as Uber, Lyft and Didi (in China) is helping to drive interest and growth in these trends, particularly fully autonomous vehicles. The increasing prevalence of mobility services will potentially create a new segment of autonomous vehicle fleet customers with unique vehicle technology and design needs, including more flexible, durable and connected seating solutions for a wide range of passengers. Not only will autonomous vehicles need to be fully connected and networked to maximize their safety and efficiency, their power consumption will be significantly higher to support the array of sensors and processing power required to operate such vehicles. This will allow us to take further advantage of our ability to design and offer efficient power management solutions. In our Seating business, our INTUTM Seating and ConfigurE+TM offerings, in addition to our light weight and more environmentally friendly products, are well-aligned with the trends toward electrification, connectivity, autonomy and shared mobility. In our E-Systems business, our broad capabilities in electrical distribution and connection systems and electronic systems also support these trends across a full range of electrified powertrains and will allow us to grow as content per vehicle increases with higher circuit counts supporting the movement of data through high speed wires.
Our business is also influenced by vehicle segment trends which continue to experience a shift in consumer preference towards crossover and sport utility vehicles. This trend positively impacts our business as content per vehicle on such vehicles, especially within our Seating business, can be significantly higher. Crossover and sport utility vehicle production has grown to approximately 42% of total vehicle production in 2021, up from 30% five years ago.

In addition, Volkswagen, Daimler and Stellantis accounted for 12%, 11% and 11% of our 2021 net sales, respectively. We supply and have expertise in all vehicle segments of the automotive market. Our sales content tends to be higher on those vehicle platforms and segments which offer more features and functionality. The popularity of particular vehicle platforms and segments varies over time and by regional market. We expect to continue to win new business and grow sales at a greater rate than overall automotive industry production. For further information related to our customers and domestic and foreign sales and operations, see Note 15, "Segment Reporting," to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
Our customers award business to their suppliers in a number of ways, including the award of complete systems, which allows suppliers either to manufacture components internally or to purchase components from other suppliers at their discretion. Certain of our customers also elect to award certain components directly to component suppliers and independent of the award of the complete system. We have been selectively expanding our component capabilities and investing in manufacturing capacity in low-cost regions in order to enhance our cost competitive structure and maximize our participation in such direct component sourcing by our customers.
Our customers typically award contracts several years before actual production is scheduled to begin. Each year, the automotive manufacturers introduce new models, update existing models and discontinue certain models and, periodically, even complete brands. In this process, we may be selected as the supplier on a new model, we may continue as the supplier on an updated model or we may lose the business on a new or updated model to a competitor. Our sales backlog reflects our estimated net sales over the next three years from formally awarded new programs, less lost and discontinued programs. This measure excludes the sales backlog at our non-consolidated joint ventures. As of January 2022, our 2022 to 2024 sales backlog is $3.3 billion, an increase of 18% as compared to our sales backlog as of January 2021. Our current sales backlog reflects $1.3 billion related to 2022 and 70% and 30% related to our Seating and E-Systems segments, respectively. In addition, our 2022 to 2024 sales backlog at our non-consolidated joint ventures is approximately $570 million. Our current sales backlog assumes volumes based on the independent industry projections of IHS Markit as of December 2021 and internal estimates, a Euro exchange rate of $1.13/Euro and a Chinese RMB exchange rate of 6.50/$. This sales backlog is generally subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including vehicle production volumes on new and replacement programs and foreign exchange rates, as well as the timing of production launches and changes in customer development plans. For additional information regarding risks that may affect our sales backlog, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Part II — Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Forward-Looking Statements."
We receive purchase orders from our customers that generally provide for the supply of a customer's annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant, or in some cases, for the supply of a customer's requirements for the life of a particular vehicle model, rather than for the purchase of a specified quantity of products. Although most purchase orders may be terminated by our customers at any time, such terminations have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operating results. We are subject to risks that an automotive manufacturer will produce fewer units of a vehicle model than anticipated or that an automotive manufacturer will not award us a replacement program following the life of a vehicle model. To reduce our reliance on any one vehicle model, we produce automotive systems and components for a broad cross-section of both new and established models. However, larger cars and light trucks, as well as vehicle platforms that offer more features and functionality, such as luxury, sport utility and crossover vehicles, typically have more content and, therefore, tend to have a more significant impact on our operating performance. Our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, consisted of 29% passenger cars, 54% crossover and sport utility vehicles and 18% trucks and vans.
Our agreements with our major customers generally provide for an annual productivity price reduction. Historically, cost reductions through product design changes, increased manufacturing productivity and similar programs with our suppliers have generally offset these customer-imposed price reduction requirements. However, raw material, energy and commodity costs can be volatile. Although we have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material, energy and commodity costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers, typically offset only a portion of the adverse impact. Certain of these strategies also may limit our opportunities in a declining commodity environment. In addition, we are exposed to increasing market risk associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange as a result of our low-cost footprint and vertical integration strategies. We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. For additional information regarding our foreign exchange and commodity price risk, see Part II — Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Financial Condition — Foreign Exchange" and "— Commodity Prices."
Seasonality
Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for holidays and/or model year changeovers, in December when many customer plants close for the holidays and during periods of high vehicle inventory. 
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used in our seat systems, electrical distribution and connection systems and electronic systems are generally available and obtained from multiple suppliers under various types of supply agreements. Components such as fabric, foam, leather, seat mechanisms, connection systems and certain other components are either manufactured by us internally or purchased from multiple suppliers under various types of supply agreements. The majority of the steel used in our products is comprised of fabricated components that are integrated into a seat system, such as seat frames, recliner mechanisms, seat tracks and other mechanical components. Therefore, our exposure to changes in steel prices is primarily indirect, through these purchased components. With the exception of certain connection systems, the materials that we use to manufacture wire harness assemblies are substantially purchased from suppliers, including extruded and insulated wire and cable. The majority of our copper purchases are comprised of extruded wire and cable that we integrate into electrical wire harnesses. In general, our copper purchases, as well as a significant portion of our leather purchases, are subject to price index agreements with our customers and suppliers. We utilize a combination of short-term and long-term supply contracts to purchase key components. We generally retain the right to terminate these agreements if our supplier does not remain competitive in terms of cost, quality, delivery, technology or customer support.
Intellectual Property
Worldwide, we have approximately 2,600 patents and patent applications pending. While we believe that our patent portfolio is a valuable asset, no individual patent or group of patents is critical to the success of our business. We also license selected technologies to automotive manufacturers and to other automotive suppliers. We continually strive to identify and implement new technologies for use in the design and development of our products.
Advanced technology development is conducted worldwide at our seven advanced technology centers and at our product engineering centers. At these centers, we engineer our products to comply with applicable safety standards, meet quality and durability standards, respond to environmental conditions and conform to customer and consumer requirements. Our global innovation and technology center located in Southfield, Michigan, develops and integrates new concepts and is our central location for consumer research, benchmarking, craftsmanship and industrial design activity.
