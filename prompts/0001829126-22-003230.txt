ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Adorbs Inc. (“Adorbs”, or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 18, 2017. Adorbs is a developmental stage corporation formed to provide organic children’s clothing designed to be cute, comfortable, and trendy. The vision of Adorbs is bright, basic & comfortable organic clothes, if the price of organic material makes financial sense, including wearable and comfortable cute clothes, leggings, t-shirt, sweatshirts, skirts, dresses, and onesies (the “Clothing Line”). The clothing has and will have basic bold colors, such as black, red, orange, yellow, green, grey, blue, purple, and fuchsia. It includes and will include, a variety of ideas with patch work, appliqué, food, emojis, animals, letters, words. This way, a child could tell a story about their clothing.
 
Former management was comprised of two people, Rebecca Jill Lazar, President; and Michael Lazar, Chief Financial Officer. Due to the development stage of the Company, Ms. Lazar spent part of her time toward the everyday operations and forward movement of the corporation. Ms. Lazar’s responsibilities included acting as the Company’s creative designer as well as determining the overall design direction of the company and its marketing strategy. Ms. Lazar cultivated relationships with children’s clothing stores and manufacturers and spent the time necessary to oversee the product development, manufacturing, sales, and marketing campaigns, website design, and direct the primary operations of the business.
 
On January 19, 2018, the Company filed a Form S-1 for registration of securities under the Securities Act of 1933. The S-1 was declared effective on March 14, 2018, and at that time the Company became a fully reporting public company. The Company filed its first Form 10-Q on May 10, 2018, for the period ended March 31, 2018, and subsequently filed all required reports until through the period ended March 31, 2019. On July 1, 2019, the Company filed a Form 15 to terminate its registration. Despite her best efforts, Ms. Lazar determined during the three months ended June 30, 2020, that the Company’s business plan was no longer viable. Subsequently, during July 2020, Ms. Lazar and her husband Michael Lazar resigned their positions executive positions with the Company and gifted their majority shareholdings for no consideration to Activist Investing LLC, an entity controlled by Michael Lazar’s brother, David Lazar. These shares were gifted in return for David Lazar’s commitment to provide funding to the Company going forward and for his expertise in managing and directing distressed companies.
 
Activist Investing LLC received 11,000,000 shares from Ms. Lazar, and 10,000,000 shares from Michael Lazar for a total of 21,000,000 shares. Based upon 23,889,500 shares outstanding, this effectively gave David Lazar 87.9% ownership of the Company. Concurrently with the change of control, David Lazar was appointed as CEO and Director and is currently the only employee, officer, and director of the Company. As a result of these transactions, the Company become a “blank check” company.
 
On June 22, 2020, the Company dismissed Michael Gillespie & Associates, PLLC “Gillespie”) as its independent registered public accounting firm who had performed the audit of the Company’s 2018 financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gillespie’s report on the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, did not contain any adverse opinions or disclaimers of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, except that such reports included explanatory paragraphs with respect to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. During the year ended December 31, 2018, and through June 21, 2020, there were no (a) disagreements (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) with Gillespie on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to satisfaction, would have caused Gillespie to make reference to the subject matter thereof in connection with its reports for the period ended 2018 or (b) reportable events, as described under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
 
On June 22, 2020 the Company appointed AJSH & Co. LLP, a PCOAB registered firm as its independent registered accounting firm who performed the Company’s audit for the period ended December 31, 2019 and has reviewed its financial statements for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2020.
