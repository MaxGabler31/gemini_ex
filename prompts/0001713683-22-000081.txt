Item 1. Business
Overview
We anticipate, secure, and simplify the experience of doing business, transforming today and tomorrow. We were incorporated in 2007, during the early stages of cloud adoption and mobility, based on a vision that the internet would become the new corporate network as the cloud becomes the new data center. We predicted that with rapid cloud adoption and increasing workforce mobility, traditional perimeter security approaches would provide inadequate protection for users and data and an increasingly poor user experience. We pioneered a cloud platform, the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, that represents a fundamental shift in the architectural design and approach to networking and security. 
Enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud to achieve greater IT agility, a faster pace of innovation and lower costs. Organizations are increasingly relying on internet destinations for a range of business activities, adopting new external SaaS applications for critical business functions and moving their internally managed applications to the public cloud, Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS, or PaaS. Users now expect to be able to seamlessly access applications and data, wherever they are hosted, from any device, anywhere in the world. We believe these trends are indicative of the broader digital transformation agenda, as businesses increasingly succeed or fail based on their IT outcomes. 
We believe that securing the on-premises corporate network to protect users and data is becoming increasingly irrelevant in a cloud and mobile-first world where organizations depend on the internet, a network they do not control and cannot secure, to access critical applications that power their businesses. We pioneered a unique approach that securely connects users, devices, and applications using business policies, regardless of the network. Our Zero Trust Exchange eliminates the need for traditional on-premises security appliances that are difficult to maintain and require compromises between security, cost and user experience. Our purpose-built, multi-tenant, distributed cloud platform incorporates the security functionality needed to enable users, applications, and devices to safely and efficiently utilize authorized applications and services based on an organization’s business policies. 
Our cloud-native platform, the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, enables customers to secure and connect users, workloads and IoT/OT devices across three core products:
•Zscaler for Users — leverages our comprehensive cloud platform to provide users secure, fast and reliable access to the internet including SaaS applications, via Zscaler Internet Access, or ZIA, and provides Zero Trust Network Access to internally hosted applications via Zscaler Private Access, or ZPA, in each case, regardless of device, location or network. We do this all while optimizing end-to-end user experience with Zscaler Digital Experience, or ZDX, which allows an organization to identify and isolate issues negatively impacting its users.
•Zscaler for Workloads – leverages Zscaler’s Zero Trust Exchange to secure workloads, whether in a public cloud or in private data centers, using our cloud-native zero trust access service to provide fast and secure app-to-internet (via ZIA) and app-to-app (via ZPA) connectivity across multi- and hybrid cloud environments, and our Posture Control solutions automatically identify and remediate cloud service, application, and identity misconfigurations for assets deployed in public cloud infrastructure. The core elements of Zscaler for Workloads address the key security and operations challenges that must be overcome in order to secure deployment of public cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
•Zscaler for IoT/OT – leverages the complete suite of Zscaler solutions to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and data loss as well as to improve user and facility safety by providing zero trust security for connected IoT and OT devices. We provide secure internet communications for IoT and OT devices, privileged access to IoT and OT devices (e.g. for maintenance), secure access to production applications (e.g. on a factory floor) and deception to provide active defense.
Before our Zero Trust Exchange, the corporate data center served as the central hub of IT security, with a physical network perimeter used to separate corporate users, devices and applications from the internet. Today, this network perimeter approach consists of appliances that have become fundamentally less effective as applications, data, users and devices rapidly move off the corporate network, making the notion of a corporate perimeter obsolete. In a world where more companies are shifting their most critical IT assets to the cloud, a zero trust architecture is required. Our architecture is vastly different from the traditional “hub-and-spoke” corporate network, where traffic from branch offices is routed to centralized data centers for security scanning and policy enforcement before reaching its destination. In contrast, our Zero Trust Exchange acts as an intelligent switchboard that uses business policies to securely connect users, devices, and applications over any network and protect against cyberthreats and data loss. We provide all of these solutions at scale, processing well over 250 billion internet requests per day. Our Zero Trust Exchange eliminates the requirement for organizations to buy and manage a variety of high cost appliances that need to be maintained by a large number of highly skilled security personnel, who are expensive and in increasingly short supply. 
Our cloud native, multitenant architecture is distributed across more than 150 data centers globally which brings security and business policy close to users and devices in 185 countries and provides fast, secure, and reliable access. Each day, we block over 150 million threats and perform over 200,000 unique security updates. Our customers benefit from the cloud security effect of our ever-expanding ecosystem because once a new threat is detected, it can be blocked across our entire customer base within minutes. 
Many of the largest enterprises and government agencies in the world rely on our solutions to help them accelerate their move to the cloud. We have over 6,700 customers across all major geographies, with an emphasis on larger organizations, and we currently count over 600 of the Forbes Global 2000 as customers. Our customers span every major industry, including financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, airlines and transportation, conglomerates, consumer goods and retail, media and communications, public sector and education, technology and telecommunications services. 
We have experienced significant growth, with revenue increasing from $431.3 million in fiscal 2020 to $673.1 million in fiscal 2021 to $1,090.9 million in fiscal 2022, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 56% and 62%, respectively. We experienced net losses of $390.3 million, $262.0 million and $115.1 million in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. We expect we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.
Our Zero Trust Exchange Platform 
Our Zero Trust Exchange cloud security platform delivers our core products; Zscaler for Users, Zscaler for Workloads and Zscaler for IoT/OT, through the deployment of our comprehensive and integrated solutions, each built natively in the cloud to power digital transformation.
Secure Internet and SaaS Access - Zscaler Internet Access 
Zscaler Internet Access, or ZIA, provides users, workloads, IoT, and OT devices secure access to externally managed applications, including SaaS applications and internet destinations regardless of device, location or network. ZIA provides inline content inspection and firewall access controls across all ports and protocols to protect organizations and users from external threats, secure data while at rest and prevent data from leaking out to unauthorized sites. Policies follow the user to provide identical protection on any device, regardless of location; any policy changes are enforced for users worldwide. Our 
cloud security platform provides full inline content inspection to assess and correlate the risk of the content to protect against sophisticated attacks, including ransomware and phishing. The cloud platform applies machine learning across our well over 250 billion daily transactions to quickly identify and block unknown threats. 
ZIA enables the following primary use cases: 
Cyberthreat Protection – Our threat prevention functionality enables protection against threats using a range of approaches and techniques. Our threat prevention capabilities provide multiple layers of protection to prevent sophisticated ransomware, phishing, and zero-day cyberattacks. We provide functionality that traditionally has been offered by disparate, stand-alone products. Our core cloud platform threat prevention services include: 
•Advanced Threat Protection: Our advanced threat protection functionality delivers real-time protection from malicious internet content like browser exploits, scripts, zero-pixel iFrames, malware and botnet callbacks. Over 200,000 unique security updates are performed every day to the Zscaler cloud to keep users protected. Once we detect a new threat to a user, we block it for all users. We call this the “cloud security effect.” 
•Sandbox: Our cloud sandbox enables enterprises to block zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats, or APTs, by analyzing unknown files for malicious behavior, and it can scale to every user regardless of location. Our cloud sandbox was designed and built to be multi-tenant and allows customers to determine which traffic should be sent for detonation. As an integrated cloud security platform, customers can set policies by users and destinations to prevent patient-zero scenarios by holding, detonating and analyzing suspicious files in the cloud sandbox before they are sent to the user. 
•Browser Isolation: Our cloud browser isolation functionality creates an isolated browsing session that enables users to access any webpage on the internet without downloading any of the web content served by the webpage onto a local device or the corporate network. With cloud browser isolation, users are not directly accessing active web content; instead, only a safe rendering of pixels is delivered to the user. Malicious code that may be hidden in the web content is kept at bay. 
Data Protection- Our data protection functionality enables enterprises to prevent unauthorized sharing or exfiltration of confidential information for users, devices, and servers, reducing our customers’ business and compliance risk. Core cloud platform data protection services include:
•Data Loss Prevention: Our data loss prevention, or DLP, functionality enables enterprises to use predefined or custom dictionaries using efficient pattern-matching algorithms to easily scale to all users and traffic, including encrypted traffic, to prevent, monitor or block unauthorized or sensitive data exfiltration. Our exact data match, or EDM, Index Document Match, or IDM, and Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, functionalities augment the accuracy and efficacy of our data loss prevention solution by enabling our customers to populate a custom database scaling to billions of unique fields, as well as unstructured documents. Our DLP policies can be enforced for inline data in motion and out-of-band for data at rest. 
•Cloud Access Security Brokerage: Our Cloud Access Security Broker, or CASB, functionality and cloud application controls enable enterprises to discover and granularly control user access to known and unknown cloud applications. By doing Transport Layer Security, or TLS, inspection at scale, we provide malware protection, data loss prevention and CASB functions that can be performed both inline and out-of-band, for specific sanctioned and unsanctioned applications. Business policies can be defined with granular access control for specified cloud applications, such as the ability to upload or download files or post comments on videos based on different user or group identity. 
•File Type Controls: Our file type control functionality allows policies to be defined that control which file types are allowed to be downloaded and uploaded based on application, user, location and destination. 
•Browser Isolation: With cloud browser isolation, users are not directly accessing active web content; instead, only a safe rendering of pixels is delivered to the user. This approach prevents sensitive data from being downloaded to unauthorized devices in bring-your-own-device environments or on shared public computers.
Secure Local Internet Breakouts – Our local internet breakout capability means traffic destined for the cloud no longer needs to be routed over a private Multiprotocol Label Switching, or MPLS, network to the data center. Traffic is now routed locally over the internet and directly to the cloud, providing for a faster experience and a significant reduction in MPLS network costs. Our core cloud platform services for local internet breakouts include: 
•Firewall: Our cloud firewall was designed to protect users by inspecting internet traffic on all ports and protocols, and it offers user level policies, application identification with deep packet inspection and intrusion prevention. 
•Bandwidth Control: Our bandwidth control and traffic shaping capabilities ensure that business critical applications are prioritized over non-business critical applications, improving productivity and user experience. By enforcing quality of service in the cloud, our platform enables the optimization of “last-mile” utilization of a customer’s network.
•DNS: Our Domain Name System, or DNS, filtering solution provides a local DNS resolver and enforces acceptable use policies. 
Secure Private Application Access - Zscaler Private Access
Zscaler Private Access, or ZPA, provides Zero Trust Network Access, or ZTNA, to secure access to internally managed applications, either hosted internally in data centers or hosted in private or public clouds. ZPA is designed around four key tenets that fundamentally change the way users access internal applications: 
•connect users to applications without bringing users on the network; 
•never expose applications to the internet; 
•segment access to applications without relying on the traditional approach of network segmentation; and 
•provide remote access over the internet without virtual private networks, or VPNs.
ZPA enforces a global policy engine that manages access to internally managed applications regardless of location. If access is granted to a user, our ZPA solution connects the user’s device only to the authorized application without exposing the identity or location of the application. Hence applications are not exposed to the internet, further limiting the external attack surface. This results in reduced cost and complexity, while offering better security and an improved user experience. 
Our ZPA solution includes broad functionality, which we categorize by the following areas: 
•Secure Application Access: Our ZPA solution delivers seamless connectivity to internally managed applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, enterprise data center, or both. Administrators can set global policies from a single console, enabling policy-driven access that is agnostic to the network the users are on. By creating seamless access to applications regardless of a user’s network, our ZPA solution eliminates the need for traditional remote access VPNs, reverse proxies and other similar products. 
•Application Discovery: Similar to CASB application discovery reports for internet applications, our ZPA solution provides granular discovery of internally managed applications to aid in the creation of segmentation policies. 
Because our ZPA solution sits on the application layer and is name-based or domain-based, organizations can quickly and seamlessly identify their internally-managed applications and then easily provision appropriate policies. 
•Application Segmentation: Our architecture provides capabilities that enable user and application level segmentation, a vast improvement over traditional network segmentation. As each user-to-application connection is segmented with microtunnels, each of which is a temporary session between a specific user and a specific application, lateral movement across the network is prevented, significantly reducing security risk. Since users are granted access only to applications for which they have permission and are not granted full access to the network, microtunnels eliminate the need for an internal firewall. 
•Application Protection: Our ZPA solution initiates and connects outbound-only links between authenticated users and internally managed applications using microtunnels. Access is provided to users without bringing them onto the corporate network and without exposing applications to the internet. Internally managed applications are not discoverable or identifiable. With no inbound connections and no public IP addresses, there is no inbound attack surface and therefore no threat of distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks. With our innovative approach, we eliminate the need for a next-generation firewall. Similarly, by completely removing the need for an exposed IP address or DNS to the internet, we eliminate the need for DDoS mitigation systems. 
•Browser Isolation: Our cloud browser isolation is used with ZPA to provide isolated sessions to internal web applications without allowing data to transfer down to unmanaged devices or active content to be uploaded into sensitive internal applications.
•Deception: Our deception solution augments our customers' ability to detect the presence of an adversary in their network by deploying decoys and lures. These decoys can be leveraged to disrupt the adversary by detecting their presence in the network and initiating mitigation using automatic orchestration via the Zscaler platform and other third party solutions. Customers can quickly deploy these capabilities by leveraging a diverse library of built-in decoys including various types of applications, network components and IoT services. The high-fidelity low-volume alerts allow customers to implement meaningful automation workflows to prevent lateral spread. 
The primary use cases for our ZPA solution include: 
•remote workforce access to private applications without legacy VPN, providing zero trust from office to data center; 
•providing non-employees with secure access to internal applications; 
•securely connecting business-to-business, or B2B, customers, service providers and supplier access to applications typically deployed as business to business portals in an extranet; 
•direct-to-cloud access to internally managed applications hosted in public cloud environments, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and Google Cloud Platform, or GCP; and 
•access to applications following a merger or acquisition by providing named users with access to named applications, without the need to merge networks. 
Experience Management - Zscaler Digital Experience
Zscaler Digital Experience, or ZDX, is designed to measure end-to-end user experience across key business applications, providing an easy to understand digital experience score for each user, application and location within an enterprise. As users have become mobile and applications have moved to the cloud, traditional network performance monitoring tools have become increasingly irrelevant. Enterprises can no longer collect performance metrics or indicators along the traditional network path as they could when they owned the network and the applications ran in their own data 
centers. When a user's experience is suffering or an event is negatively impacting user experience, ZDX allows an organization to isolate where in the network path an issue is occurring and whether it is caused by a user’s device, the WiFi connection, the local internet connection, a service provider in the path or the destination application itself. With ZDX, enterprises can quickly determine if an issue is associated with a single user, application or location or indicates a broader issue potentially impacting other users, applications or locations all via a simple visual workflow without a need for additional hardware or software.
Cloud Applications and Workload Security - Posture Control
Our Posture Control solution automatically identifies and remediates cloud service, application, and identity misconfigurations for assets deployed in public cloud infrastructure. The platform leverages a unified, graph-based database, correlating signals across several cloud security engines to identify and prioritize cloud risks and security incidents. Comprehensive integrations with other Zscaler products provide unprecedented breadth in capabilities for protecting cloud assets from buildtime to runtime. Our Posture Control solution is comprised of the following functionalities: 

•Cloud Security Posture Management, or CSPM, automatically identifies and remediates application misconfigurations in SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS to reduce risk and ensure compliance with industry and organizational benchmarks. 
•Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management, or CIEM detects and remediates excessive or unused cloud permissions and enforces least privileged access without disrupting productivity. 
•Infrastructure as Code, or IaC, scanning analyzes a broad range of IaC templates to identify misconfigurations and other security issues prior to deployment to cloud infrastructure.
•Vulnerability Scanning leverages agentless technology to scan container and virtual machine assets for unpatched software vulnerabilities in both running cloud assets and in images stored in cloud registries.
•Data Loss Prevention, or DLP, leverages the same DLP technology offered with ZIA to identify and protect sensitive or exposed data in public cloud storage services, such as AWS S3. 
Preventing Lateral Threat Movement in Public Clouds — Workload Segmentation
Our Workload Segmentation solution secures application-to-application communications inside public clouds and data centers to stop lateral threat movement, preventing application compromise and reducing the risk of data breaches. Workload Segmentation utilizes an innovative approach that makes it significantly simpler to deploy and operate than traditional segmentation solutions. Workload Segmentation improves the security of east-west communication by verifying the identity of the communicating application software, services and processes to achieve a zero trust environment. This reduces the attack surface, resulting in lower risk of application compromise and data breaches. 
Our Technology and Architecture
We are driven by technology and innovation. We developed a highly scalable, multi-tenant, globally distributed cloud capable of providing inline inspection of internet and SasS traffic, securing access to private applications, protecting cloud applications, managing digital experience and scanning for exposures and misconfigurations. We designed a purpose-built three-tier architecture starting with our core operating system and adding layers of security and networking innovations over time. Our cloud platform is protected by more than 340 issued and pending patents in the United States and other countries. Our cloud is distributed across more than 150 data centers on five continents and processes over 240 billion requests per day from users across 185 countries. 
Our platform is designed to be resilient, redundant and high-performing. It is built as software modules that run on standard x86 platforms without any dependency on custom hardware. The platform modules are split into the control plane (Zscaler Central Authority), the enforcement plane (Zscaler Enforcement Nodes) and the logging and statistics plane (Zscaler Log Servers) as described below:
•Zscaler Central Authority: The Zscaler Central Authority monitors our entire security cloud and provides a central location for software and database updates, policy and configuration settings and threat intelligence. The collection of Zscaler Central Authority instances together act like the brain of the cloud, and they are geographically distributed for redundancy and performance. 
•Zscaler Enforcement Nodes: Customer traffic is directed to the nearest Zscaler Enforcement Node, where security, management and compliance policies served by the Zscaler Central Authority are enforced. The Zscaler Enforcement Node also incorporates our differentiated authentication and policy distribution mechanism that enables any user to connect to any Zscaler Enforcement Node at any time to ensure full policy enforcement. The Zscaler Enforcement Node utilizes a full proxy architecture and is built to ensure data is not written to disk to maintain the highest level of data security. Data is scanned in RAM only and then erased. Logs are continuously created in memory and forwarded to our logging module. 
•Zscaler Log Servers: Our technology is built into the Zscaler Enforcement Node to perform lossless compression of logs, enabling our platform to collect over 130 terabytes of unique raw log data every day. We do not collect customer data other than logs, and those logs are encrypted and transmitted to our log server at a destination of choice without ever writing to disk at the enforcement nodes. Logs are transmitted to our logging servers over secure connections and multicast to multiple servers for redundancy. Our dashboards provide our customers visibility into their traffic to enable troubleshooting, policy changes and other administrative actions. Our analytics capabilities allow customers to interactively mine billions of transaction logs to generate reports that provide insight on network utilization and traffic. We do not rely on batch reporting; we continuously update our dashboards and reporting and can stream logs to a third-party Security Information and Event Management, or SIEM, service as they arrive. Regardless of where users are located, customers can choose to have logs stored in the United States or the European Union/Switzerland. Customer data is isolated as part of our multi-tenant architecture. 
Our platform is a critical integration point positioned in the data path providing secure access to the internet, cloud and internal applications. We complement and interoperate with key technology and cloud vendors across major market segments, including software-defined wide area network, or SD-WAN, identity and access management, or IAM, device and endpoint management, as well as SIEM for reporting and analytics. Many of these vendors, like us, were developed in the cloud and together provide a foundation for a modern access and security architecture. 
Growth Strategies 
The growing use of the internet and the increasing adoption of the cloud and mobility are driving network and application transformation. As a provider of a fully integrated, multi-tenant cloud security solution, we enable our customers to accelerate this secure transformation to the cloud and believe we are uniquely positioned to maximize value as they undertake these transitions. Key elements of our growth strategy include: 
•Continue to win new customers. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand our customer base, both in the United States and internationally. We have invested significantly in our sales and marketing organization to execute against this opportunity. 
•Expand in existing customers. We leverage a land-and-expand approach with our existing customers to sell subscriptions for additional users, additional solutions and premium solution bundles that contain more functionality.
•Leverage channel partners to participate in cloud transformation initiatives. We have invested in establishing long-standing relationships with global telecommunications service providers and are expanding our network of global system integrators and regional telecommunications service providers and cloud-centric value-added resellers and public cloud marketplaces.
•Expansion and innovation of services. We continue to invest in research and development and acquire new technologies and products in order to add new and differentiated solutions to our existing product portfolio and to improve the overall functionality, reliability, availability and scalability of our cloud security platform. 
•Expansion into additional market segments. We are primarily targeting the expansion of our immediate addressable market, emphasizing U.S. federal government agencies in the near- to medium-term as well as additional international markets in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions.
We sell to enterprises of all sizes. As of July 31, 2022, we had over 6,700 customers, including over 600 of the Forbes Global 2000. Many of our customers include major global enterprises that send virtually all of their internet traffic through our cloud security platform. Our customers operate in a variety of industries, including airlines and transportation, conglomerates, consumer goods and retail, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media and communications, public sector and education, technology and telecommunications services. Approximately 51% of our revenue was from customers outside the United States for all periods presented. No end customer contributed more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020.
Sales and Marketing
Although we have a channel sales model, we use a joint sales approach in which our sales force develops relationships directly with our customers, and together with our channel account teams, works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. Our customer care and success teams maintain high-touch relationships with our customers to deploy and manage our cloud platform, identify, analyze and resolve performance issues and respond to security threats. We believe customer service touchpoints are opportunities to further develop our relationship with our customers and potentially generate incremental revenue through the addition of new users and services. 
Our channel partners consist of global telecommunications service providers, system integrators, value-added reseller partners and public cloud marketplaces, and we leverage their relationships to expand our reach, improve procurement and accelerate customer fulfillment. 
We enter into agreements with our channel partners in the ordinary course of business. The contracts typically have a one-year term and renew automatically, subject to cancellation by either party upon 90 days’ notice. These agreements contain standard commercial terms and conditions, including payment terms, billing frequency, warranties and indemnification. Our channel partners generally place purchase orders with us after receiving orders from customers. We generally maintain privity of contract with customers through end user subscription agreements. 
We expect to continue investing in our channel partners as we provide them with education, training and programs, including supporting their independent sales of our solutions. We believe that such investment, and investments in our sales force, will lead to significant expansion in our customer base, which will materially impact our business and results of operations. 
Our marketing strategy is focused on platform and brand awareness, which drives our opportunity pipeline and customer demand. This strategy is account-based, enabling us to pursue targeted marketing activities across both digital and non-digital channels. We anticipate increasing our marketing team headcount and are investing in programs designed to 
elevate our brand in the market and engage new enterprise accounts. We also participate in a number of cloud and security industry events. In addition, we have a deeply integrated ecosystem of channel partners, with whom we engage in joint marketing activities.
Data Center Operations 
We operate our services across more than 150 data centers around the world, which are built to be highly resilient, have multiple levels of redundancy and provide failover to other data centers in our network. Our data centers are co-located within top-tier internet interconnection hubs that have direct connectivity, known as peering, to major telecommunication service providers, SaaS providers, public cloud providers, internet content providers and popular internet destinations. A number of our data centers are also located with our service provider partners. 
Our platform has received ISO 27001 certification since 2014. In addition, since 2017 we received and currently maintain ISO 27701, 27018 and 27017 certifications. We are also SOC2, SOC 3 and CSA-STAR compliant. In 2022, we received our HIPAA compliance and NIST 800-63C.
 We also built a leading U.S. and international government compliance portfolio. We are authorized at the FedRAMP High level for ZPA and Impact Level 5 with the DOD. In addition, we are authorized at both the FedRAMP Moderate and high levels for ZIA. We also hold ITAR, DFARS, FIPS, CJIS and VPAT 508 in our government portfolio. We also became the first cloud-based SaaS security company to achieve StateRamp for state and local governments, and have received TXRamp in Texas. Internationally, we are IRAP Protected and OAPRA in Australia, Cyber Essentials and G-Cloud in the UK, C5 in Germany and “in process” for ITSG-33 Prob B in Canada and ISMAP in Japan. 
Research and Development 
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, architecture, operation and quality of our cloud platform. In addition to improving on our features and functionality, this organization works closely with our cloud operations team to ensure that our platform is reliable, available and scalable. ThreatLabZ, our internal team of security experts, researchers and network engineers, analyzes the global threat landscape, works to eliminate threats across our cloud platform and reports on emerging security issues. 
Research and development expense was $289.1 million, $174.7 million and $97.9 million for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Our research and development leadership team is based in San Jose, California, and we also maintain research and development centers in India, Canada, Israel and Spain. 
Competition 
The market for security solutions is defined by changing technologies, an evolving threat landscape and complex enterprise needs. Our competitors and potential competitors include legacy on-premises appliance vendors across a number of categories: 
•independent IT security vendors, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., Fortinet, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc. and Broadcom, which offer a broad mix of network and endpoint security products; 
•large networking vendors, such as Cisco Systems, Inc. and Juniper Networks, Inc., which offer security appliances and incorporate security capabilities in their networking products; 
•companies such as SkyHigh Security (previously McAfee Enterprise), Trellix (a combination of McAfee Enterprise and FireEye, Inc.), Forcepoint Inc. (previously, Websense, Inc.), Netskope, Inc. and Pulse Secure, LLC with point 
solutions that compete with some of the features of our cloud platform, such as proxy, firewall, CASB, sandboxing and advanced threat protection, data loss prevention, encryption, load balancing and VPN; and 
•other providers of IT security services that offer, or may leverage related technologies to introduce, products that compete with or are alternatives to our cloud platform. 
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include: 
•delivering security from the cloud regardless of location of the user; 
•platform features, effectiveness and extensibility; 
•platform reliability, availability and scalability; 
•rapid development and delivery of new capabilities and services; 
•ability to integrate with other participants in the security and networking ecosystem; 
•price, total cost of ownership and network cost savings; 
•brand awareness, reputation and trust in the provider’s services; 
•strength of sales, marketing and channel partner relationships; and 
•quality of customer support. 
We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. Our cloud platform integrates many of the point products offered by our competitors and potential competitors, which is a key differentiator. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks, more diverse product and services offerings and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our services, including through selling at zero or negative margins, offering concessions, product bundling or maintaining closed technology platforms. Further, many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their appliance-based network security architecture and may not be willing or ready to abandon those historical investments. As our market grows and rapidly changes, we expect it will continue to attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new products and services. In addition, we may expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets. 
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights. As of July 31, 2022, we had 340 issued patents and pending patent applications, including 155 issued patents, in the United States and other countries. Our issued patents expire between 2028 and 2041 and cover various aspects of our cloud platform. In addition, we have registered “Zscaler” as a trademark in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we have registered other trademarks and filed other trademark applications in the United States. We are also the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “Zscaler” and similar variations. In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment or similar agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights through provisions in our subscription and license agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and 
technology. In addition to our internally developed technology, we also license software, including open source software, from third parties that we integrate into or bundle with our cloud platform. 
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors will try to develop products and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third-parties may also claim that our platform infringes their intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies and non-practicing entities, have in the past and may in the future, assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers or channel partners, with whom our license or other agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third-party could prevent us from offering certain services or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected subscriptions or services, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly higher profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights. See “Risk Factors-Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights, or other lawsuits asserted against us, could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects” for additional information. 
Government Regulation
Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, data privacy and employment and labor and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods.

Human Capital 
As of July 31, 2022, we had a total of 4,975 employees, including 2,737 employees located outside the United States, with the majority of non-US based employees located in India. None of our U.S. based employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be positive and collaborative.
Zscaler's vision is to create a world in which the exchange of information is always secure and seamless. Ensuring that our people and culture are aligned with this vision is critical to our success. In order to continue to innovate and to execute our business strategy, we must attract, develop, and retain skilled employees, particularly in the areas of product development, engineering, sales and customer success. Our position as a market leader enables us to be a destination for cybersecurity talent looking to innovate and contribute to enabling digital transformation, and while hiring and retaining employees with expertise in cybersecurity has become more difficult due to increased competition for talent, we have added 1,822 new employees over the past 12 months in response to growing customer interest in and demand for our products.
We understand the importance of human capital so investing in our culture, talent development, compensation and benefits, and diversity and inclusion continues to be a priority.
Our Culture
Our culture is about creating an environment where a global and diverse workforce can contribute their best work to help our customers and our business succeed. We believe that our journey to be the best starts by creating a workplace where the most talented people share our values and seek the opportunity to make a difference by providing better cybersecurity to individuals and organizations around the world. Zscaler's cultural values are:
•Teamwork - We respect people for their diverse perspectives and backgrounds and are able to disagree while remaining respectful. We are open minded and work towards the best solution. This mindset leads us to put the team’s needs before personal needs; we win when the team wins.
•Open Communication - We are approachable and transparent and have integrity in everything we do. We say what we mean and mean what we say. We confront and resolve issues; at Zscaler we find the courage to have the hard conversations.
•Passion - We are ambitious and driven to be the best while staying humble and grounded. We find our purpose and continue to master our craft. We strive to show conviction and be resilient and persistent for the right reasons.
•Innovation - We are creative and solve complicated problems by inventing something new. We think beyond the conventional and predictable because we believe no outcome is impossible. We are willing to take risks and fail fast to learn.
•Customer Obsession - We go above and beyond what is expected and delight our customers. We seek to connect and understand our customers’ challenges to better solve them. We build lasting relationships with our customers because our interactions are strategic rather than transactional.
We receive feedback on our culture from our employees through multiple surveys throughout the year, including our annual Employee Engagement Survey. In fiscal 2022, 86% of our employees participated in the survey. We found that 87% of responding employees are highly engaged and 94% of responding employees are aligned with our strategic direction. We also monitor feedback through external sources, such as Glassdoor, where we were named one of Glassdoor’s 2022 “Best Places to Work” for the second year in a row. We ultimately view and measure the success of our culture by our ability to sustain great business results.
Talent Development
We invest in our employees through a suite of programs to develop their talent and skills as our business grows. Over the past year, this intentional approach to talent development has led to us being able to promote 22% of our global workforce. We operate a program called “Leading at Z” that establishes clear expectations, enables measurement and feedback, and ensures that our people managers have access to the development programming which helps them to live by our leadership principles. In addition, new employees in our customer care and success teams are enrolled in structured sales training to complete internal certifications. Our technical teams have access to live and online training resources and participate in frequent company tech talks where training on best practices and latest developments are shared. In 2021, we launched “Zscaler Elevate,” our internal mentorship program to support employee career and personal growth; we now have more than 450 employees engaged as mentors, mentees or both.
To supplement our internal resources, we partner with leading development organizations and tools. In 2022, we invested in partnerships with leading executive coaching organizations to offer even more focused development for key leaders. We offer tuition reimbursement for eligible employees to further enhance their career growth through higher education.
Compensation and Benefits
 We provide competitive compensation and benefits packages to attract and retain our talent. In addition to base pay, employees may be eligible for annual bonuses that are tied to our financial performance and long-term equity incentives that vest subject to continued service. Certain employees may also need to achieve defined performance metrics for their long-term incentives to vest. We offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows employees to contribute a percentage of their wages to purchase our stock at a discount. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer our employees a robust portfolio of benefits, such as health, wellbeing and retirement programs, to meet their individual and family needs. In fiscal 2022, we extended our global parental leave benefits to 18 weeks of fully paid maternity leave and 8 weeks of paternity leave so that new parents and caregivers have more time to spend with their families and loved ones. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 We believe that a diversity of backgrounds, experiences and thinking contributes to creating a culture that enables innovation, execution and performance. At the end of fiscal 2022, women represented 23% of our global workforce in 26 countries and underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities represented 8% of our U.S. based employees.
We have taken steps to address the diversity challenges that we face in the cybersecurity industry. We initiated a hiring practice where our recruiters strive to build a talent pipeline that is diverse at the top of the hiring funnel, connecting with candidates from under-represented groups.
Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Committee is comprised of leaders across the organization that acknowledge, value, encourage and support a diverse and inclusive workforce for all our employees. Our company supports the following employee resource groups: Women in Zscaler Engage, Asian American Pacific Islander Employees at Zscaler, Black Employees at Zscaler, Latinx and Hispanic at Zscaler, Pride at Zscaler and Veterans at Zscaler. In addition to running company-wide events and programs to share perspectives, these groups provide safe places for employees to connect with colleagues facing similar professional and personal challenges.
To further support our efforts, we offer courses for diversity awareness and training on topics such as managing bias. In 2022, we invested in a cohort-based executive leadership program that builds the capabilities of the next generation of women leaders at Zscaler. Our foundational leadership programs emphasize the role of diversity in building high performing teams. We have also hosted external diversity events, for example, bringing together accomplished women technology leaders to share their experiences with the broader community.
Health, Safety and Wellbeing
The health and safety of our employees is our top priority. We recognize the need to create a flexible working environment that balances collaboration, innovation, and connectivity with personal preferences for employees to do their best work. We have taken steps to look after the holistic wellness experience for our employees with “Wellbeing at Z” our wellness program that supports employees across four pillars:
•Physical: We offer preventative health programs and benefits focused on physical activity, nutrition, and self-care.
•Emotional: We provide an enhanced employee-assistance program dedicated to encouraging employees and family members to approach their mental health proactively along with resources to manage stress and anxiety in the workplace and beyond.
•Social: We help employees build relationships and cultivate a sense of belonging through our community programs, six employee resource groups, and mentoring opportunities.
•Financial: We provide education, tools, and benefits that help our people understand and plan for their financial future.
Wellbeing at Z has been designed to meet the health needs of our employees through connection and support with flexibility for local and specific-group needs. We will continue to review and invest in programs to provide for the health, safety and well-being of our employees.
