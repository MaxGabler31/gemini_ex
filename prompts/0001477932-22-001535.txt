Item 1: Description of Business

Allure Worldwide, Inc. (“Allure” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Florida on September 26, 2018, to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company has had no operations to date. Other than issuing shares to its original shareholders, the Company never commenced any operational activities. Effective as of November 18, 2019, the Company redomiciled to Nevada.

The Company was formed with the intention of seeking to acquire the assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business which generates revenues, in exchange for its securities. As such, the Company is defined as a “shell” company, whose sole purpose at this time is to locate and consummate a merger or acquisition with a private entity.

The proposed business activities described above classify the Company as a “blank check” company. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their prospective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in the Company’s securities until such time as the Company has successfully implemented its business plan described herein. 

On January 11, 2021, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Genvor Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Genvor”) to acquire (the “Acquisition”) Genvor in consideration of (i) the payment of $150,000 by Genvor to Allure; (ii) Allure’s founding shareholders transferring 19,000,000 shares of common stock to Genvor’s shareholders, constituting 95% of Allure’s 20,000,000 total outstanding shares; and (iii) Allure’s founding shareholders retaining 1,000,000 shares of Allure’s common stock. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, after closing of the Acquisition and for a period of two years following commencement of trading of Allure’s common stock, the parties agreed that Allure will make additional issuances of Allure’s common stock to the founding shareholders to ensure that in the aggregate they maintain their 5% ownership of Allure’s outstanding common stock. On March 2, 2022, the Company and Genvor entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) to consummate the Acquisition, and pursuant to which a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Genvor Acquisition, Corp., a Delaware corporation, will merge (the “Merger”) with and into Genvor, with each share of Genvor common stock issued immediately prior to the time of the merger automatically converted into the right to receive one share of common stock of the Company. The Company anticipates filing a certificate of merger to effect the Acquisition and Merger as soon as audited financial statements of Genvor as of and for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, are complete (and any interim financial statements for subsequent fiscal quarters have been completed).
