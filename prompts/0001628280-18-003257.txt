Item 1. Business.
General
Systemax Inc., through its operating subsidiaries, is primarily a direct marketer of brand name and private label products. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1995. Certain predecessor businesses which now constitute part of the Company have been in business since 1949. Our headquarters office is located at 11 Harbor Park Drive, Port Washington, New York.
Recent developments
The Company currently operates and is internally managed in two reportable segments - Industrial Products Group ("IPG") and Europe Technology Products ("ETG"), the Company's France operations. Smaller business operations and corporate functions are aggregated and reported as the additional segment - Corporate and Other ("Corporate"). In 2016, the Company sold certain assets of its Misco Germany business, which had been reported as part of its ETG segment, and its rebate processing business, which had been reported as part of its Corporate segment, and sold certain assets and liabilities of its NATG business in December 2015. The Company's continuing operations consist of its IPG and ETG segments.
As disclosed in our Form 8-K dated March 31, 2017, on March 24, 2017, certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company executed a definitive securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with certain special purpose companies formed by Hilco Capital Limited (“Hilco” and together with its management team partners, “Purchaser”).  Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Purchaser acquired all of the Company’s interests in Systemax Europe SARL, which includes its subsidiaries, Systemax Business Services K.F.T., Misco UK Limited, Systemax Italy S.R.L., Misco Iberia Computer Supplies S.L., Misco AB, Global Directmail B.V. and Misco Solutions B.V. (collectively, the “SARL Businesses”). The SARL Businesses were reported within the Company's European Technology Products Group ("ETG") segment. The transaction closed immediately upon execution of the Purchase Agreement.
The Company retained its France technology value added reseller business, which is conducted through its subsidiary, Inmac Wstore S.A.S., which was not part of the sale transaction.
The SARL Businesses were sold on a cash-free, debt-free basis; proceeds were nominal.   As part of the transaction, the Company retained a 5% residual equity position in the Purchaser’s acquiring entity, HUK 77 Limited, which is being accounted for on the cost method, to which no value was ascribed, a $3.3 million note receivable ($2.2 million balance at December 31, 2017 which was paid in full in January 2018) and provided limited transition services to Purchaser through December 19, 2017 under a transition services agreement. The note receivable is included in accounts receivable, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017. In October 2017, Misco UK Ltd. ("Misco UK"), one of the companies included in the sold SARL Businesses, was entered into administration insolvency proceedings in the UK. The Company's rights under the Purchase Agreement and the note receivable relate to the Purchaser and other affiliated entities which are not subject to such proceedings. The Company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on the Company due to the insolvency of Misco UK. 
The sale of the SARL business met the “strategic shift with major impact” criteria as defined under Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which requires disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. Under ASU 2014-08 in order for a disposal to qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements, the disposal must be a "strategic shift" with a major impact for the reporting entity. If an entity meets this threshold, and other requirements, only the components that were in operation at the time of disposal are presented as discontinued operations. Therefore, the current year and prior year results of the SARL Businesses are included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Current Operations
Industrial Products
IPG sells a wide array of maintenance, repair and operational (“MRO”) products, as well as other industrial and general business supplies, which are marketed in North America.  Many of these products are manufactured by other companies. Some products are manufactured for us to our own design and marketed under the trademarks: Global™, GlobalIndustrial.com™, Nexel™ Relius™, Relius Solutions™,Paramount™ and Interion™. Industrial products accounted for 63%, 61% and 56% of our net sales from continuing operations in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Europe Technology Products Group
ETG sells information and communications technology ("ICT") products. These products are marketed primarily in France and to a much lesser extent Belgium. Substantially all of these products are manufactured by other companies. ETG accounted for approximately 37%, 37% and 32% (excluding sales of the sold Germany operations for 2016 and 2015) of our net sales from continuing operations in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Technology Products – NATG
NATG sold ICT and CE products.  These products were marketed in North America.  Substantially all of these products were manufactured by other companies; however, the Company did offer a selection of products that were manufactured for our own design and marketed on a private label basis.  NATG accounted for 0% of our net sales from continuing operations in 2017 and 2016 and 8% in 2015.
See Note 2 and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for additional financial information about our business as well as information about our geographic operations.
Discontinued Operations
As discussed above, the SARL Businesses were sold in March 2017 and the NATG B2B and Ecommerce business and the three remaining retail stores in operation at the time of the sale in 2015 are presented in discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. Total net sales for the discontinued operations were $117.0 million, $521.6 million and $1.7 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Operating History and Restructuring of NATG Operations
In March 2015, the Company announced a restructuring of its NATG business. The NATG segment sold products categorized as Information and Communications Technology (“ICT”) and Consumer Electronics (“CE”) products.  These products included computers, computer supplies and consumer electronics which were marketed in North America. The Company followed the guidance under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. The sale of the NATG business in December 2015 had a major impact on the Company and therefore met the strategic shift criteria. The NATG components in operation at the time of the sale were the B2B and Ecommerce businesses and three remaining retail stores. Accordingly, these components and the results of operations have been adjusted in the accompanying financial statements to reflect their presentation in discontinued operations. 
Products
We offer over a million brand name and private label products. We endeavor to expand and keep current the breadth of our product offerings in order to fulfill the increasingly wide range of product needs of our customers.
MRO and other industrial related products offered by our IPG segment include storage and shelving, material handling, janitorial and maintenance, furniture and office, HVAC/R and fans, workbench and shop desks, safety and security, outdoor and grounds maintenance, tools and instruments, office and school supplies, plumbing and pumps, packaging and supplies, electrical and lighting, food service and appliances, raw materials and building supplies, motors and power transmission, pneumatics and hydraulics, medical and laboratory equipment, metalworking and cutting tools, vehicle maintenance, and fasteners and hardware. 
ICT products offered by our ETG segment include: servers-storage and backup, desktop computers, laptops, tablets, monitors, mobile devices; computer parts and memory; computer components and accessories; networking and security; software; electronics and commercial and home networking.  CE products include TV and video; audio; cameras and surveillance; GPS; cell phones; video games; home and electronics accessories.
Sales and Marketing
We market our products primarily to B2B customers, which include for-profit businesses, educational organizations and government entities. We have developed numerous proprietary customer and prospect databases. We have established a multi-faceted direct marketing system to business customers, consisting primarily of our relationship marketers, catalog mailings and proprietary internet websites, the combination of which is intended to maximize sales.

Relationship Marketers
Our relationship marketers focus their efforts on our business customers by establishing a personal relationship between such customers and a Systemax account manager. The goal of the relationship marketing sales force is to increase the purchasing productivity of current customers and to actively solicit newly targeted prospects to become customers. With access to the records we maintain, our relationship marketers are prompted with product suggestions to expand customer order values. In certain countries, we also have the ability to provide such customers with electronic data interchange (“EDI”) ordering and customized billing services, customer savings reports and stocking of specialty items specifically requested by these customers. Our relationship marketers’ efforts are supported by e-mail campaigns and periodic catalog mailings, both of which are designed to generate inbound telephone sales, and visits to our interactive websites, which allow customers to purchase products directly over the Internet. We believe that the integration of our multiple marketing methods enables us to more thoroughly penetrate our business, educational and government customer base. We believe increased internet exposure leads to more internet-related sales and also generates more inbound telephone sales; just as we believe email campaigns, and to a lesser extent catalog mailings which feature our websites results in greater internet-related sales.
E-commerce
We currently operate multiple e-commerce sites, including:


North America | Europe 
www.globalindustrial.com | www.inmac-wstore.com
www.globalindustrial.ca | www.misco.fr 
www.nexelwire.com | 
www.chdistgov.com | 
www.industrialsupplies.com | 


We are continually upgrading the capabilities and performance of these websites in our significant markets. Our internet sites feature over a million MRO and ICT products.  Our customers have around-the-clock, online access to purchase products and we have the ability to create targeted promotions for our customers’ interests.
In addition to our own e-commerce websites, we have partnering agreements with several of the largest internet shopping and search engine providers who feature our products on their websites or provide “click-throughs” from their sites directly to ours.  These arrangements allow us to expand our customer base at an economical cost.
Catalogs
As IPG and France have increased their focus on online and e-commerce advertising, marketing and sales activities, they have decreased their use of hard copy catalogs over the last several years, and currently distribute fewer regular and specialty catalogs than in prior periods.
Customer Service, Order Fulfillment and Support
We generally receive orders through the Internet, by telephone, by EDI, through online chat, and to a small extent via fax.  We generally provide toll-free telephone number access for our customers in countries where it is customary.  Certain domestic call centers are linked to provide telephone backup in the event of a disruption in phone service.
Certain of our products are carried in stock, and orders for such products are fulfilled on a timely basis directly from our North American and France distribution centers, typically within one day of the order. Orders are generally shipped by third-party delivery services.  We maintain relationships with thousands of distributors and product vendors in North America and Europe that also deliver products directly to our customers.
We maintain a database of commonly asked questions for our technical support representatives, enabling them to respond quickly to similar questions.  We conduct regular on-site training seminars for our sales representatives to help ensure that they are well trained and informed regarding our latest product offerings.
Suppliers
7

We purchase substantially all of our products and components directly from both large and small manufacturers as well as large wholesale distributors. Two vendors accounted for 10% or more of our purchases in continuing operations in 2017: one vendor accounted for 16.0% and another vendor accounted for 12.0%.  In 2016, two vendors accounted for 10% or more of our purchases: each vendor accounted for 13.6% of our purchases and in 2015, one vendor accounted for 11.2% and another vendor accounted for 11.1% of our purchases. The loss of these vendors, or any other key vendors, could have a material adverse effect on us. Most private label products are manufactured by third parties to our specifications.
Competition and Other Market Factors
Industrial Products
The market for the sale of industrial products in North America is highly fragmented and is characterized by multiple distribution channels such as small dealerships, direct mail distribution, internet-based resellers, large warehouse stores and retail outlets. We face competition from large diversified MRO distributors such as Grainger Inc., MSC Industrial Direct Inc., Fastenal Inc., and other large retailers, including Amazon.  We also face competition from manufacturers’ own sales representatives, who sell industrial equipment directly to customers, and from regional or local distributors.  Many purchasers begin sourcing products via search engine or mobile application on desktops, laptops, or mobile devices. In the industrial products market, customer purchasing decisions are primarily based on price, product selection, product availability, level of service and convenience.  We believe that direct marketing via sales representatives, the internet and catalogs are effective and convenient distribution methods to reach mid-sized facilities that place many small orders and require a wide selection of products.  In addition, because the industrial products market is highly fragmented and generally less brand oriented, we believe it is well suited to private label products.
Technology Products
The market for selling technology product is highly competitive, with many U.S., European and Asian companies vying for market share. We face competition from large value added resellers such as Econocom, Computacenter, Insight and other large retailers. There are few barriers to entry, with these products being sold through multiple channels of distribution, including direct marketers, computer resellers, mass merchants, over the internet, local and national retail computer stores, and by computer and office supply superstores.
Timely introduction of new products or product features and services are critical elements to remaining competitive. Other competitive factors include product performance, quality and reliability, technical support and customer service, marketing and distribution and price. Some of our competitors have stronger brand-recognition, broader product lines and greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and technological resources than us.
Conditions in the ETG market for technology products remain highly competitive and subject to large bid and tender awards, resulting in our frequent discounting of product sales price as well as offering free or highly discounted freight.  These actions have and may continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits.  Additionally, we rely in part upon the introduction of new technologies and products by other manufacturers in order to sustain long-term sales growth and profitability.  There is no assurance that the rapid rate of such technological advances and product development will continue.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed a total of approximately 1,900 employees, of whom 1,400 were in North America and 500 were in Europe and Asia.
Seasonality
Seasonality does have some effect on the Company’s continuing IPG and ETG businesses. Within IPG, certain product lines are highly seasonal in nature, including HVAC and outdoor furniture. As these are two material lines of business within IPG, sales and margin in the second and third quarters tend to be higher than those in the first and fourth quarters. Within ETG, customers, vendors, and employees tend to take extended holidays in late summer. As such, buying behaviors and accompanying margin rates tend to be lower in the third quarter.
Environmental Matters
8

Under various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations in North America, Europe and Asia, a current or previous owner or operator (including the lessee) of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at such real property. Such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault.  We lease most of our facilities.  In connection with such leases, we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remedial actions with respect to hazardous substances.  Although we have not been notified of, and are not otherwise aware of, any material real property environmental liability, claim or non-compliance, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur remediation or other costs in connection with real property environmental matters in the future.
Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations
We currently sell substantially all of our products through established sales channels to our customers in North America (primarily the United States and Canada) and France.   Approximately 40.0%, 40.8%, and 45.6% of our net sales from continuing operations during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively were made by subsidiaries located outside of the United States.
