Our Strategy
Growth
As an organization, we are committed to “Total Growth”, meaning we strive towards delivering value through organic initiatives, innovations and acquisitions, as well as financial performance. With an emphasis on increasing recurring revenues and expanding our margins, we believe our Total Growth strategy will ultimately drive overall cash flow generation, thus helping to fuel our disciplined capital allocation approach and further our ability to deepen our account coverage and identify and execute strategic acquisitions. With strategic acquisitions, we are well positioned to expand our product portfolio and improve our ability to innovate and grow organically, which helps us to meet our long-term growth targets. We believe our Total Growth strategy is a durable model, that we believe will create both near and long-term shareholder value through organic and acquired growth, capital efficiency and profitability.
We are committed to continuous innovation. Our investments in R&D push product innovation, increasing the value of our offerings to our installed customer base, which includes Global 10,000 companies (G10K), SMB and consumers. The G10K are the world's largest companies, ranked by estimated total revenues, as well as the world's largest governments and organizations. More valuable products, coupled with our established global partner program, lead to greater distribution and cross-selling opportunities which further help us to achieve organic growth. Over the last three fiscal years, we have invested a cumulative total of $1.2 billion in R&D or 12.3% of cumulative revenue for that three-year period. On an annual basis, we target to spend 12% to 14% of revenues for R&D expense.
As a global leader in Information Management, we know customers need an integrated set of cloud products, solutions and services as a foundation for efficiency and growth. The cloud is a strategic business imperative that drives customers’ investment in product innovation, business agility, operational efficiency and cost management. OpenText expects the cloud to be our largest driver of growth. We are committed to continuing our investment in the OpenText Cloud to best suit the evolving needs of our customers. Supported by a global, scalable and secure infrastructure, OpenText Cloud Editions includes a foundational platform of technology services, and packaged business applications for industry and business processes. OpenText Cloud Editions enables organizations to protect and manage information in public, private or hybrid deployments at scale.
We remain a value oriented and disciplined acquirer, having efficiently deployed $6.5 billion on acquisitions over the last 10 fiscal years. Mergers and acquisitions are one of our leading growth drivers. We look for companies that are situated within our total addressable markets.
We have developed a philosophy, the OpenText Business System, that is designed to create value by leveraging a clear set of operational mandates for integrating newly acquired companies and assets. We see our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and assets into our business as a strength and pursuing strategic acquisitions is an important aspect to our Total Growth strategy. We expect to continue to acquire strategically, to integrate and innovate, and to deepen and strengthen our intelligent information platform for customers.
We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities and at any time may be at various stages of discussion with respect to such opportunities. For additional details on our acquisitions, please see “Acquisitions During the Last Five Fiscal Years”, elsewhere in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In March 2020, COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has significantly impacted the global economy and has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our operational and financial performance. The extent of the adverse impact of the pandemic on the global economy and markets will continue to depend, in part, on the length and severity of the measures taken to limit the spread of the virus, the availability, effectiveness and use of treatments and vaccines and on actual and potential resurgences. We are closely monitoring the potential effects and impact on our operations, businesses and financial performance, including liquidity and capital usage, though the extent is difficult to fully predict due to the evolution of this uncertain situation. 
We continue to conduct business with modifications to employee travel and work locations and also virtualization of certain events, along with modified interactions with customers and suppliers, among other modifications. In addition, as many local governments and officials have started lifting pandemic restrictions in accordance with the guidance of public health experts, in July 2022, we implemented a Flex-Office program in which a majority of our employees work a portion of their time in the office and a portion remotely. See “We have implemented a Flex-Office program, which will subject us to certain operational challenges and risks” in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including customer purchasing decisions, and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including our Flex-Office program, as may be required by governments, or that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders. It is uncertain and difficult to predict what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business including the effects on our customers and prospects, or our financial results and our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives. 
The ongoing and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control. For more information, please see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
OpenText Revenues
Our business consists of four revenue streams: cloud services and subscriptions, customer support, license and professional service and other. For information regarding our revenues by significant geographic area for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, please see Note 20 “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cloud Services and Subscriptions
Cloud services and subscriptions revenues consist of (i) SaaS offerings, (ii) APIs and data services, (iii) hosted services and (iv) managed service arrangements. These offerings allow customers to transmit a variety of content between various mediums and to securely manage enterprise information without the commitment of investing in related hardware infrastructure.
We offer B2B integration solutions such as messaging and managed services. Messaging services allow for the automated and reliable exchange of electronic transaction information, such as purchase orders, invoices, shipment notices and other business documents, amongst businesses worldwide. Managed services provide an end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solution to our customers, including program implementation, operational management and customer support. Our cloud-based Business Network enables customers to effectively manage the flow of electronic transaction information with their trading partners and reduces the complexity of disparate standards and communication protocols.
Customer Support
The first year of our customer support offering is usually purchased by customers together with the license of our Information Management software products. Customer support is typically renewed on an annual basis and historically customer support revenues have been a significant portion of our total revenue. Through our OpenText customer support programs, customers receive access to software and security upgrades, a knowledge base, discussion boards, product information and an online mechanism to post and review “trouble tickets.” Additionally, our customer support teams handle questions on the use, configuration and functionality of OpenText products and help identify software issues, develop solutions and document enhancement requests for consideration in future product releases.
License
License revenues consist of fees earned from the licensing of software products to our customers. Our license revenues are impacted by the strength of general economic and industry conditions, the competitive strength of our software products and our acquisitions. The decision by a customer to license our software products often involves a comprehensive implementation process across the customer’s network or networks and the licensing and implementation of our software products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers.
Professional Service and Other
We provide consulting and learning services to customers. Generally, these services relate to the implementation, training and integration of our licensed product offerings into the customer's systems.
Our consulting services help customers build solutions that enable them to leverage their investments in our technology and in existing enterprise systems. The implementation of these services can range from simple modifications to meet specific departmental needs to enterprise applications that integrate with multiple existing systems.
Our learning services consultants analyze our customers' education and training needs, focusing on key learning outcomes and timelines, with a view to creating an appropriate education plan for the employees of our customers who work with our products. Education plans are designed to be flexible and can be applied to any phase of implementation: pilot, roll-out, upgrade or refresher. OpenText learning services employ a blended approach by combining mentoring, instructor-led courses, webinars, eLearning and focused workshops.
Marketing and Sales
Customers
Our customer base consists of G10K organizations, enterprise companies, public sector agencies, mid-market companies, SMB and direct consumers. 
Partners and Alliances 
We are committed to establishing relationships with the best resellers and technology and service providers to ensure customer success. Together as partners, we fulfill key market objectives to drive new business, establish a competitive advantage and create demonstrable business value.
We have a number of strategic partnerships that contribute to our success. These include the most prominent organizations in enterprise software, hardware and public cloud, with whom we work to enhance the value of customer investments. They include:
•SAP SE (SAP): We are SAP’s partner for content services. The OpenText Suite for SAP solutions provides key business content within the context of SAP business processes providing enhanced efficiencies, reduced risk and better experiences for customers, employees and partners - accessible anywhere and anytime and available on and off-cloud.
•Google Cloud: We work together with Google Cloud to deploy our Information Management solutions on the Google Cloud Platform. This includes a containerized application architecture for flexible cloud or hybrid deployment models. Deploying our solutions on the Google Cloud Platform allows our customers to scale their deployments as their businesses demand. We offer our solutions as a managed service and selected products as a SaaS offering. 
•Amazon Web Services (AWS): Our collaboration offers businesses the opportunity to consume our Information Management solutions as fully managed services on AWS for cost savings, increased performance, scalability and security.
•Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft): Together with Microsoft, we enable customers to connect all aspects of their content infrastructure, integrating these into business processes and enable collaboration, management and governance on the most valuable asset - information. With the acquisition of Zix Corporation (Zix) in 2021, we extended our partnership with Microsoft by becoming one of their nine authorized Cloud Solutions Providers in the North American market.
•Oracle Corporation (Oracle): We develop innovative solutions for Oracle applications that enhance the experience and productivity of users working with these tools.
•Salesforce.com Corporation (Salesforce): The company-to-company partnership between OpenText and Salesforce is focused on growing a full portfolio of Information Management solutions to complement the Salesforce ecosystem by uniting the structured and unstructured information experience.
Our Global Partner Program offers five distinct programs: Referral, Reseller, Services, Technology and Support. This creates an extended organization to develop technologies, repeatable service offerings and solutions that enhance the way our customers maximize their investment in our products and services. Through the Global Partner Program, we are extending market coverage, building stronger relationships and providing customers with a more complete local ecosystem of partners to meet their needs. Each distinct program is focused to provide valuable business benefits to the joint relationship.
Global Systems Integrators (GSIs) provide customers with digital transformational services around OpenText technologies. They are trained and certified on OpenText solutions and enhance the value of our offerings by providing technical credibility and complementary services to customers. Our GSIs include Accenture plc, ATOS International S.A.S., Capgemini Technology Services SAS, Cognizant Technology Solutions U.S. Corp., Deloitte Consulting LLP and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).
Our partner program also enables MSPs, resellers, distributors and network and security vendors to grow through cloud-based cybersecurity, threat intelligence and backup and recovery solutions aimed at the SMB and consumer markets. We provide the industry-specific tools, services, training, integrations, certifications and platforms our partners need to ensure trust and reliability with their customer base.
We currently have over 22,000 MSPs in our network and it is expected to grow. This is a key go-to-market channel for us as MSPs act as an intermediary between the solutions vendors like OpenText and the SMB market. An MSP specializes in their local market and provides managed services to their clients.
International Markets
We provide our product offerings worldwide. Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a geographically diverse workforce, providing greater stability to our operations and revenue streams by diversifying our portfolio to better mitigate against the risks of a single geographically focused business.
There are inherent risks to conducting operations internationally. For more information about these risks, see “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
The market for our products and services is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change and shifting customer needs and economic pressures. We compete with multiple companies, some that have single or narrow solutions and some that have a range of information management solutions, like us. Our primary competitor is International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), with numerous other software vendors competing with us in the Information Management sector, such as Hyland Software Inc., Datto Holding Corp., Quadient SA, Veeva Systems Inc., SPS Commerce Inc., Box Inc., CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. and Adobe Inc. In certain markets, OpenText competes with Oracle and Microsoft, who are also our partners. In addition, we also face competition from systems integrators that configure hardware and software into customized systems. Additionally, new competitors or alliances among existing competitors may emerge and could rapidly acquire additional market share. We expect that competition will increase because of ongoing software industry consolidation.
We believe that certain competitive factors affect the market for our software products and services, which may include: (i) vendor and product reputation; (ii) product quality, performance and price; (iii) the availability of software products on multiple platforms; (iv) product scalability; (v) product integration with other enterprise applications; (vi) software functionality and features; (vii) software ease of use; (viii) the quality of professional services, customer support services and training; and (ix) the ability to address specific customer business problems. We believe the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer.
Research and Development
The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and competitive new products and features. As a result, our success, in part, depends on our ability to continually enhance our existing products in a timely and efficient manner and to develop and introduce new products that meet customer needs while reducing total cost of ownership. 
To achieve these objectives, we have made and expect to continue to make investments in research and development, through internal and third-party development activities, third-party licensing agreements and potentially 
through technology acquisitions. We expect a significant amount of our future R&D investment will be in cloud-based technologies.
Our R&D expenses were $440.4 million for Fiscal 2022, $421.4 million for Fiscal 2021 and $370.4 million for Fiscal 2020. We believe our spending on research and development is an appropriate balance between managing our organic growth and results of operations. We expect to continue to invest in R&D to maintain and improve our products and services offerings.
Acquisitions During the Last Five Fiscal Years
We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within the Information Management market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities.
Below is a summary of certain significant acquisitions we have made over the last five fiscal years.
•On December 23, 2021, we acquired Zix, a leader in SaaS based email encryption, threat protection and compliance cloud solutions for SMBs, for $894.5 million. 
•On November 24, 2021, we acquired all of the equity interest in Bricata Inc. (Bricata) for $17.8 million.
•On March 9, 2020, we acquired XMedius, a provider of secure information exchange and unified communication solutions, for $73.5 million.
•On December 24, 2019, we acquired Carbonite Inc. (Carbonite), a leading provider of cloud-based subscription backup, disaster recovery and endpoint security to SMB, consumers and a wide variety of partners, for $1.4 billion.
•On December 2, 2019, we acquired certain assets and certain liabilities of Dynamic Solutions Group (The Fax Guys) for $5.1 million.

•On July 26, 2017, we acquired Covisint, a leading cloud platform for building Identity Access Management, Automotive and IoT applications, for $102.8 million.
We believe our acquisitions support our long-term strategy for growth, strengthen our competitive position, expand our customer base and provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our earnings and provide superior shareholder value. We expect to continue to strategically acquire companies, products, services and technologies to augment our existing business.
Intellectual Property Rights
Our success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to develop, protect and maintain our intellectual property and proprietary technology and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our software products are generally licensed to our customers on a non-exclusive basis for internal use in a customer's organization. We also grant rights to our intellectual property to third parties that allow them to market certain of our products on a non-exclusive or limited-scope exclusive basis for a particular application of the product(s) or to a particular geographic area.
We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights. We have obtained or applied for trademark registration for corporate and strategic product names in selected major markets. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications, including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions, which relate to various aspects of our products and technology. The duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and is typically 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent. From time to time, we may enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation in line with our strategic and business objectives. While we believe our intellectual property is valuable and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.
For more information on the risks related to our intellectual property rights, see “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Looking Towards the Future 
In Fiscal 2023 we intend to continue to implement strategies that are designed to: 
Broaden Our Information Management Reach into the G10K. As technologies and customers become more sophisticated, we intend to be a leader in expanding the definition of traditional market sectors. We continue to expand our direct sales coverage of the G10K as we focus on connecting this marquee customer base to our information platform.
Invest in the Cloud. Today, the destination for innovation is indisputably the cloud. Businesses of all sizes rely on a combination of APIs, public and private clouds, managed services and off-cloud solutions. As a result, we are committed to continue to modernize our technology infrastructure and leverage existing investments in the OpenText Cloud. The combination of OpenText cloud-native applications and managed services, together with the scalability and performance of our partner public cloud providers, offer more secure, reliable and compliant solutions to customers wanting to deploy cloud-based Information Management applications. OpenText Cloud Editions is designed to build additional flexibility and scalability for our customers: becoming cloud-native, connecting anything and extending capabilities quickly with multi-tenant SaaS applications and services.
Deepen Existing Customer Footprint. We believe one of our greatest opportunities is to sell newly developed or acquired technologies to our existing customer base, and cross-sell historical OpenText products to newly acquired customers. We have significant expertise in a number of industry sectors and aim to increase our customer penetration based on our strong credentials. We are particularly focused on circumstances where the customer is looking to consolidate multiple vendors with solutions from a single source while addressing a broader spectrum of business problems or equally new or existing customers looking to take a more holistic approach to digital transformation.
Invest in Technology Leadership. We believe we are well-positioned to develop additional innovative solutions to address the evolving market. We plan to continue investing in technology innovation by funding internal development, acquiring complementary technologies and collaborating with third-parties.
Deepen Strategic Partnerships. OpenText is committed culturally, programmatically and strategically to be a partner-embracing company. Our partnerships with companies such as SAP SE, Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce.com Corporation and others serve as examples of how we are working together with our partners to create next-generation Information Management solutions and deliver them to market. We will continue to look for ways to create more customer value from our strategic partnerships.
Broaden Global Presence. As customers become increasingly multi-national and as international markets continue to adopt Information Management solutions, we plan to further grow our brand, presence and partner networks in these new markets. We are focused on using our direct sales for targeting existing G10K customers and plan to address new geographies and SMB customers, jointly with our partners.
Deliver Organic Growth. We are focused on investing and delivering on future organic growth. The Information Management market is large and is expected to continue to grow and we expect cloud to be our leading growth driver. We have multiple initiatives that are designed to deliver organic growth. We are guiding our customers along their cloud journey, investing in our mid-market channel and deepening our relationships with our partners and hyperscalers. As customers move more into the cloud, it will facilitate cross-sell and upsell opportunities across the product portfolio and geographies.
Selectively Pursue Acquisitions. We expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to strengthen our service offerings in the Information Management market. Considering the continually evolving marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within the Information Management market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities. We plan to continue to pursue acquisitions that complement our existing business, represent a strong strategic fit and are consistent with our overall growth strategy and disciplined financial management. We may also target future acquisitions to expand or add functionality and capabilities to our existing portfolio of solutions, as well as add new solutions to our portfolio.
Human Capital
Our Global Footprint
Our ability to attract, retain and engage a diverse workforce committed to innovation, operational excellence and the OpenText mission and values across our global footprint is a cornerstone to our success.
As of June 30, 2022, we employed a total of approximately 14,800 individuals, of which 7,150 or 49% are in the Americas, 2,720 or 18% are in EMEA and 4,930 or 33% are in Asia Pacific. Currently, we have employees in 35 countries enabling strong access to multiple talent pools while ensuring reach and proximity to our customers. Please see “Results of Operations” included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our definitions of geographic regions.
The approximate composition of our employee base is as follows: (i) 2,700 employees in sales and marketing, (ii) 4,300 employees in product development, (iii) 3,300 employees in cloud services, (iv) 1,500 employees in professional services, (v) 1,000 employees in customer support and (vi) 2,000 employees in general and administrative roles. 
We believe that relations with our employees are strong. None of our employees are represented by a labour union, nor do we have collective bargaining arrangements with any of our employees. However, in certain European jurisdictions in which we operate, a “Workers' Council” represents our employees.
Employee Safety / COVID-19 Response
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented Project Shield as a business continuity plan to address employee, customer, facility and technology-related challenges associated with the pandemic. Project Shield maintains the overarching principle of providing safe environments for our employees, customers, partners, as well as the communities where we work.
Project Shield takes a strong human capital focus, including enabling well-researched global awareness, post-pandemic support for our employees and managing a safe return to our workplace. We focus on analyzing key COVID-19 related data and public health protocols to support executive decisions, ensuring regular executive and employee communications and making strong connections with leaders around the world to respond swiftly to local changes.
Over the course of the pandemic, we have ensured our benefit programs support employees, and we established the OpenText Employee Relief Fund to provide financial assistance for employees requiring additional support for medical costs related to contracting COVID-19.
Project Shield extended our work from home approach at the beginning of Fiscal 2022 providing employees with continued flexibility and safety globally. In July 2022, we implemented our Flex-Office program in which a majority of our employees work a portion of their time in the office and a portion remotely.
We continue to invest in software and hardware along with office redesign to support a flexible workforce where teams can collaborate and be productive. Using our offices in a purposeful way drives innovation, creativity and teamwork. Our past experiences continue to inform our future workplace standards and practices.
We remain committed to maintaining a healthy workplace where all employees and office visitors feel safe and respected by implementing new health and safety protocols aligned with regional guidelines.
Employee Engagement
We regularly conduct employee research to understand perceptions in the areas of engagement, company strategy, personal impact, manager effectiveness, recognition, career development and equity, diversity and inclusion. Participation level and engagement have remained high. Throughout the phases of the pandemic, employee communication and listening strategies increased, including supplemental surveys ranging from topics of well-being, feedback from new hires on the quality of their onboarding and office re-opening plans.
Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance
The OpenText Zero-In Initiative is our commitment to our global impact goals and initiatives related to ESG. We believe the future of growth is sustainable and inclusive, and we commit to zero footprint, zero barriers and achieving our commitments with zero compromise through our purposeful goals to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040, zero waste from operations by 2030 and to be majority ethnically diverse among employees by 2030 with equal gender representation in key roles and 40% women in leadership positions at all management levels.
Our charitable giving program supports activities at the local and global level, focused on education, innovation, disaster relief and the health and welfare of children and families. We also provide employees three paid days off to volunteer and make an impact to the causes that matter most to them. In addition, the OpenText Navigator Fund identifies and addresses key needs in our communities. We launched the Navigator Internship Program to create pathways to digital jobs for Indigenous and under-represented minority students.
Recognizing that many millions of families are still recovering from the economic impact of the pandemic, we dedicated the holiday season to supporting food banks globally.
To operate long-term, we need to ensure that our local communities and the natural environment are thriving. We are committed to mitigating any adverse environmental impacts of our business activities, which at a minimum means abiding by all environmental laws, regulations and standards that apply to us. Our Environmental Policy articulates our commitment to measuring and managing our environmental impact. We integrate the consideration of environmental concerns and impacts into our everyday decision making and business activities. Externally, we promote sustainable consumption by developing and promoting environmentally sound technologies to support our customers’ digital transformations, including transitioning to the cloud environment. Internally, we continue to develop, implement and manage company-wide environmental initiatives.
Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (ED&I)
We are passionate about creating an inclusive environment where skilled and diverse employees thrive, deliver compelling innovations to our customers and provide shareholder value. We are committed to increasing equity in opportunity for all employees regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion or other differences. 
At OpenText, we have established a global Equity, Diversity and Inclusion steering committee to guide ED&I programs. We bring our ambition to life through impact teams made of employees who come together to recommend policies, programs and initiatives across a range of topics.
Our impact teams are leading global initiatives with local impact which include: 
•Awareness and Training: For employees and managers on matters such as inclusive leadership practices and diversity awareness;
•Recruiting: Platforms that are inclusive, diverse slates for key leadership roles and an increased focus on virtual work opportunities to widen recruiting talent and diversity;
•Advancement: Internal career building opportunities, mentoring and networks;
•Advocacy: Employee affinity groups, including “Black Employee Empowerment” and “Women in Technology”, fostering sponsorship, community and career conversations; and
•Civic Action: Focusing an ED&I lens on community outreach and engagement.
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation philosophy is based on a set of principles that align with business strategy, reflect business and individual performance levels, consider market conditions to ensure competitiveness, demonstrate internal pay equity for similar roles and reflect the impact that economic conditions have on pay programs.
Our compensation and benefit programs are regularly reviewed through an executive-sponsored governance process. Across the Company, we offer a wide variety of retirement and group benefits including medical, life and disability, which are designed to protect employees and their dependents against financial hardship due to illness or injury. Programs are designed to recognize the diversity of our work force and a range of well-being needs. We also have regional Employee Assistance Programs in many countries that provide 24/7 confidential counselling, support and access to resources for employees and their families. The OpenText Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is a global benefit program that allows all eligible employees to purchase OpenText shares at a 15% discount and provides the opportunity for employees to strengthen their ownership in the Company while enjoying the benefits of potential share price appreciation. 
Internal equity is a cornerstone of our goals. Our pay programs are carefully designed and governed, from hiring practices to consistency in progression rates for common roles. In designing variable pay for performance awards, we focus only on measurable outcomes rather than subjective measures. This ensures true equity in opportunity and awards tied to business results.
Employee Education, Training and Compliance
We know that employees join OpenText for continuous learning, experience and credentials to shape their careers. Our strategies focus on ensuring strong technical credentials, building capabilities, new skills sets and a high duty of care in ensuring ethical, secure and compliant practices. All employees have internal access to certification on OpenText and partner products.
Leaders and managers play a key role in the engagement of employees. From a focus on high quality interviewing and onboarding of new hires to the importance of career development planning, we foster a culture and value proposition of career development. Internal applications to job postings are highly encouraged. Our annual Career Week event focuses on career development planning and honing manager skills in developing teams. 
We offer an annual education reimbursement program to all employees globally. This program aligns with our commitment to support internal development, equal opportunity and mobility across all of our geographies, regardless of an employee’s role, function or location. We have designed the education reimbursement program to meet the needs of all personalized development goals through programs that range from technical to business skills. 
As part of our commitment to the highest standards of conduct, all employees and contractors participate in an annual formal Compliance and Data Security Training, including Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Responsible Business Practices, Data Protection, Global Data Privacy Practices, Protecting Information and Preventing Sexual Harassment Training. These compliance programs ensure that we operate our business with integrity, following standard business ethics across the globe.
