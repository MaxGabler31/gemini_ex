ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Overview
Lumentum Holdings Inc. (“we”, “our”, “Lumentum” or the “Company”) is an industry-leading provider of optical and photonic products defined by revenue and market share addressing a range of end market applications including Optical Communications and Commercial Lasers for manufacturing, inspection and life-science applications. We seek to use our core optical and photonic technology and our volume manufacturing capability to expand into attractive emerging markets that benefit from advantages that optical or photonics-based solutions provide, including 3D sensing for consumer electronics and diode light sources for a variety of consumer and industrial applications. The majority of our customers tend to be original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that incorporate our products into their products which then address end-market applications. For example, we sell fiber optic components that our network equipment manufacturer (“NEM”) customers assemble into communications networking systems, which they sell to network service providers or enterprises with their own networks. Similarly, many of our customers for our Lasers products incorporate our products into tools they produce, which are used for manufacturing processes by their customers. For 3D sensing, we sell diode lasers to manufacturers of consumer electronics products for mobile, personal computing, and gaming who then integrate our devices within their products, for eventual resale to consumers and also into other industrial applications.
We operate in two reportable segments: Optical Communications (“OpComms”) and Commercial Lasers (“Lasers”).
We have a global marketing and sales footprint that enables us to address global market opportunities for our products. We have manufacturing capabilities and facilities in North America, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, with employees engaged in R&D, administration, manufacturing, support and sales and marketing activities. Our headquarters are located in Milpitas, California, and we employed approximately 2,930 full-time employees around the world as of June 30, 2018.
Lumentum was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of JDS Uniphase Corporation (“JDSU”) on February 10, 2015, and is comprised of the former communications and commercial optical products (“CCOP”) segment and WaveReady product lines of JDSU. In August 2015, we became an independent publicly-traded company through the distribution by JDSU to its stockholders of 80.1% of our outstanding common stock (the “Separation”). Each JDSU stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 27, 2015, received one share of Lumentum common stock for every five shares of JDSU common stock held on such date. JDSU was renamed Viavi Solutions Inc. (“Viavi”) and at the time of distribution, retained ownership of 19.9% of Lumentum’s outstanding shares. Since the Separation, Viavi has sold a significant portion of its shares and is no longer a significant shareholder of Lumentum.
Our business traces its origins to Uniphase Corporation, which was formed in 1979, and became publicly traded in 1992. Uniphase was originally a supplier of commercial lasers, and later, a leading supplier of optical transmission products. In 1999, JDS Fitel Inc., a pioneer in products for fiber optic networking which was formed in 1981, merged with Uniphase to become JDSU, a global leader in optical networking. Subsequent acquisitions by JDSU broadened the depth and breadth of the OpComms and Lasers businesses, as well as the intellectual property, technology and product offerings, of what is now Lumentum. Notable amongst these acquisitions in the OpComms business were Agility Communications, Inc. in 2005 and Picolight, Inc. in 2007 which respectively brought widely tunable, long wavelength laser technology for metro and long haul networking applications and short wavelength vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (“VCSELs”) for enterprise, datacenter networking, and 3D sensing applications. The fundamental laser component technologies which we acquired through these acquisitions, form the basis of virtually all optical networks today and we believe will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. These technologies will enable us to develop highly integrated products to satisfy our communications customers’ ever increasing needs for smaller, lower power and lower cost optical products. Notable acquisitions in the Lasers business were Lightwave Electronics Corporation in 2005 and Time-Bandwidth Products Inc. (“Time-Bandwidth”) in 2014. Both of these Lasers acquisitions brought high power pulsed solid-state laser products and technology to our business, which address the micro laser machining market and expanded our addressable market.
Industry Trends and Business Risks
Our business is driven by end-market applications which benefit from the performance advantages that optical solutions enable.
3

The OpComms markets we serve are experiencing continually increasing needs for higher data transmission speeds, fiber optic network capacity and network agility. This is driven by rapid growth in both the number of higher bandwidth broadband connections, notably those associated with mobile devices, such as high-definition video, online gaming, cloud computing and the number and scale of datacenters that require fiber optic links to enable the higher speeds and increased scale necessary to deliver high bandwidth video and other services. Our technology, which was originally developed for communications applications is also finding use in other emerging market opportunities including 3D sensing applications that employ our laser technology in mobile devices, computers, augmented and virtual reality and other consumer electronics devices. Additionally, our products are used in emerging automotive, industrial, security, safety and surveillance applications.
In the Lasers markets, customer demand is driven by the need to enable faster, higher precision volume manufacturing techniques with lower power consumption, reduced manufacturing footprint and increased productivity. These capabilities are critical as industries develop products that are smaller and lighter, increasing productivity and yield and lowering their energy consumption. 
Our optical and laser solutions, developed in close collaboration with OEM partners, are well positioned to meet demand resulting from these trends. We do, however, expect to continue to encounter a number of industry and market risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may limit our visibility, and consequently, our ability to predict future revenue, profitability and general financial performance, and could create quarter over quarter variability in our financial measures. For example, the demand environment in China has fluctuated significantly in recent years, and has created volatility and uncertainty in our future demand. We cannot predict when or to what extent these uncertainties will be resolved. Our revenues, profitability and general financial performance may also be affected by: (i) pricing pressures, particularly within our OpComms markets, due to, among other things, a highly concentrated customer base, increasing competition, particularly from Asia-Pacific-based competitors, and a general commoditization trend for certain products; (ii) high product mix variability which affects revenue and gross margin; (iii) fluctuations in customer buying patterns, which cause volatility in demand, revenue and profitability; and (iv) the current trend of communication industry consolidation, which is expected to continue, that directly affects our customer bases and adds additional risk and uncertainty to our financial and business projections.
Reportable Segments
We are an industry leading provider of optical and photonic products defined by revenue and market share addressing a range of end-market applications including optical communications and commercial lasers. We have two operating segments: OpComms and Lasers. The two operating segments were primarily determined based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and to assess their performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and manufacturing, are considered in determining the formation of these operating segments. We do not track all of our property, plant, and equipment by operating segments. For the geographic identification of these assets, refer to “Note 19. Operating Segments and Geographic Information”.

Trends 
To remain competitive, network operators worldwide must offer broader suites of digital services. To do this, they are migrating to Internet-protocol (“IP”) networks and expanding long-haul, metro regional and metro access networks, which effectively deliver broadband services while lowering capital and operating costs of dense-wavelength-division multiplexing networks. 
The growing demand for capacity encourages the adoption of OpComms products across the Datacom and Telecom markets. Demand for capacity in the Datacom market is driven by the growing needs of LANs and WANs. Growth in Datacom is also driven by web and cloud services companies that are expanding data center infrastructure, increasing the need for network capacity within and between these data centers. 
Demand in the Telecom market is driven by new bandwidth-intensive applications that can result in sudden and severe changes in demand almost anywhere on the network. Increasing agility in optical networks by employing ROADMs, wavelength selective switches, wavelength tunable transmission products and other agile optical products provides an effective way to respond to unpredictable bandwidth demands and to manage expenses. With more agile optical networks, a network operator can add capacity by using remote management applications rather than dispatching technicians to perform manual operations in the field. 
In addition, the high-end routers, switches and cross-connect equipment that must handle legacy and internet-protocol traffic are becoming increasingly complex in order to meet higher bandwidth, scalability, speed and reliability needs. Products must provide higher levels of functionality and performance in compact designs that must also meet requirements for quality, reliability, and cost. 
5

Deployment of fiber closer to the end user increases the availability of high-bandwidth services and we expect it will result in increased demand on the metro regional and long-haul networks into which these services feed. The dynamically reconfigurable nature of today’s agile networks enables lower operating costs and other competitive advantages, allowing service providers to use and scale network capacity more flexibly, streamline service provisioning, accelerate rerouting around points of failure and modify network topology through simple point-and-click network management systems. 
Our optical products are well positioned to meet these demands. Our innovation has resulted in products that have more functionality, are less than half the size, require less power and are more cost-effective than our historical products, particularly in the area of photonic integrated circuits. Higher levels of integration have also led to development of our Super Transport Blade, which delivers all transport functions (wavelength switching, pre-amplification, post-amplification, optical supervisory channel and monitoring) in a single, integrated platform, essentially replacing three blades with one. 
Strategy 
In our OpComms segment, we are focused on technology leadership through collaborative innovation with our customers, cost leadership and functional integration. We endeavor to align the latest technologies with industry leading, scalable manufacturing and operations to drive the next phase of optical communications technologies and products for Telecom and Datacom applications that are faster, more agile and more reliable, making us a valuable business and technology partner for NEMs, consumer electronic companies, cloud service providers and data center operators.
Competition 
We compete against various public and private companies in the markets we serve. Publicly traded companies providing optical communications components include II-VI, Acacia Communications, Accelink, ams AG, Applied Optoelectronic, Finisar, Foxconn Interconnect Technology, Furukawa Electric, Neophotonics, Oclaro, and Sumitomo Electric Industries. Private companies and subsidiaries of public companies providing optical communications components include Fujitsu Optical Components - a subsidiary of Fujitsu, Innolight Technology, Nistica - a subsidiary of Fujikura, and O-Net. 
Offerings
In addition to a full selection of active and passive components, we offer increasing levels of functionality and integration in modules, circuit packs and subsystems for transmission, amplification, wavelength management and more. 
In the Telecom market, we provide transmission and transport solutions for optical networks that make up the backbone of the wireline Telecom infrastructure, thereby enabling the internet. Transmission products, such as our tunable transponder, transceiver and transmitter modules, transmit and receive high-speed data signals at the ingress/egress points of the network. These products use dense wavelength division multiplexing technology to enable high capacity (from 20 to 40Tb/s in the C-Band) links driven by increasing internet demand. We also offer components including tunable lasers, receivers and modulators to address the higher end of these same network applications. 
Our transport products, such as ROADMs, amplifiers and optical channel monitors provide switching, routing and conditioning of signals. We also make components for transport, including 980nm, multi-mode and Raman pumps for optical amplifiers, and passive components. Passive components include switches, attenuators, photodetectors, gain flattening filters, isolators, wavelength-division multiplexing (“WDM”) filters, arrayed waveguide gratings (“AWGs”), multiplex/de-multiplexers and integrated passive modules. 
Our innovation led to the Super Transport Blade, which integrates all major optical transport functions into a single-slot blade. This all-in-one solution reduces the size, cost and power requirements of optical components, incorporates nano wavelength selective switch technology and enables greater chassis density and a smaller footprint. 
In the Datacom market, which relies on storing, moving and manipulating vast amounts of data, we offer transmission products, such as our optical transceivers for Fiber Channel and Ethernet applications. Our transceivers are also used to connect servers, switches, routers and other information technology infrastructure critical for today’s email, enterprise resource planning and other cloud services such as streaming of high definition and 4k video. 
Our integrated fiber optic transceivers provide cost effective and scalable connectivity and are used in the hardware that runs many of the applications people use daily such as email, social networking, cloud storage, online gaming and streaming video. They are available in several hot-pluggable form factors and allow for very compact, high-density hardware designs. 
For the high 100G data rate, we offer several technologies to balance technical and commercial requirements. For high volume, short distance applications we developed our VCSELs. VCSELs are ideal for short reaches because they are low power consumption, low cost and highly scalable. For high-performance, longer distance applications we have our distributed feedback laser (“DFB”) 
6

and electro-absorption modulated laser (“EML”). Our individual lasers and compact laser arrays offer an innovative solution for the LANs, SANs, broadband Internet and metro-area network as well as hyperscale datacenter applications. 
Our 3D sensing technology enables real time depth information to any photo or video image. This represents a fundamental transition for image capture akin to the transition from monochrome to color and gives devices the ability to see the world around them in three dimensions. The immediate applications include full body imaging for gaming, 3D scanning for space mapping and facial recognition for security. Emerging applications for this technology include various mobile device applications, autonomous vehicles, self-navigating robotics and drones in industrial applications and 3D capture of objects coupled with 3D printing. 3D sensing can be applied to any device with a camera. The technologies to achieve accurate and stable 3D sensing are converging to laser based solutions. We are a leading supplier of the critical laser illumination sources for 3D sensing systems being used in applications for gaming, computing, mobile devices, and home entertainment. 
Lasers
Markets
Our Lasers products serve our customers in markets and applications such as sheet metal processing, general manufacturing, biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, and precision machining such as drilling in printed circuit boards, wafer singulation, glass cutting and solar cell scribing.
Our Lasers products are used in a variety of OEM applications including diode-pumped solid-state, fiber, diode, direct-diode and gas lasers such as argon-ion and helium-neon lasers. Fiber lasers provide kW-class output powers combined with excellent beam quality and are used in sheet metal processing and metal welding applications. Diode-pumped solid-state lasers provide excellent beam quality, low noise and exceptional reliability and are used in biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, materials processing and precision machining applications. Diode and direct-diode lasers address a wide variety of applications, including laser pumping, thermal exposure, illumination, ophthalmology, image recording, printing, plastic welding and selective soldering. Gas lasers such as argon-ion and helium-neon lasers provide a stable, low-cost and reliable solution over a wide range of operating conditions, making them well suited for complex, high-resolution OEM applications such as flow cytometry, DNA sequencing, graphics and imaging and semiconductor inspection.
We also provide high-powered and ultrafast lasers for the industrial and scientific markets. Manufacturers use high-power, ultrafast lasers to create micro parts for consumer electronics and to process semiconductor, LED, and other types of chips. Use of ultrafast lasers for micromachining applications is being driven primarily by the increasing use of consumer electronics and connected devices globally.
Our portfolio of Lasers products includes components and subsystems used in a variety of OEM applications that range in output power from milliwatts to kilowatts and include ultraviolet, visible and infrared wavelengths. We support customer applications in the biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, materials processing and other precision machining areas. 
Customers 
Our Lasers customers include Amada, ASML Holding, Beckman Coulter, Becton, Dickinson and Company, DISCO, Electro Scientific Industries, EO Technics, Han’s Laser Technology, and KLA-Tencor. During fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, we did not have any single customer attributable to our Lasers segment that generated net revenue of 10% or more of our total net revenue for the applicable fiscal year.
Trends 
As technology advances, industries such as consumer electronics manufacturing increasingly turn to lasers when they need more precision, higher productivity and energy efficient, or “green,” alternatives for problems that cannot be solved by mechanical, electronic or other means. For example, these industries are using lasers to develop products that are smaller and lighter to increase productivity and yield and to lower their energy consumption. Lasers have been used for years to help achieve the scale and precision needed in semiconductor processing. In biotech applications, lasers have been instrumental for advances (and new standard procedures) in cytology, hematology, genome sequencing and crime scene investigations, among others. We believe the long-term trends in these industries will likely lead to increased demand for lasers. 
Sheet metal processing and metal welding applications are increasingly using kW-class fiber lasers instead of kW-class CO2 lasers. Fiber lasers generate higher productivity at lower cost in such applications because they exhibit lower power consumption, better quality and generally lower user maintenance costs.
In addition, demand continues for electronic products, as well as products and components in other industries, with greater functionality while becoming smaller, lighter and less expensive. Innovative / Next generation product designs require precise 
7

micromachining and materials processing, such as micro bending, soldering and welding. At the scale and processing speed needed, lasers are replacing mature mechanical tools such as drills for minute holes, or “vias,” in printed circuit boards and saws and scribes for singulating silicon wafers, resulting in greater precision and productivity. As these trends continue, we believe that manufacturers and other industries will increase their reliance on lasers in order to maintain or increase their competitiveness. 
We believe we are well-positioned with key OEM providers of laser solutions to these industries. We continue to develop our laser portfolio to offer smaller and more cost-effective products designed specifically for the performance, integration, reliability and support needs of our OEM customers. 
Strategy 
In our Lasers segment, we leverage our long-term relationships with OEM customers to drive commercial laser innovation. Using established manufacturing, engineering, lasers and photonics expertise, we deliver products that meet cost-of-ownership and reliability needs while delivering on volume production demands.

We believe we have strengthened our business model by expanding our addressable markets, customer base and expertise, diversifying our product portfolio and fortifying our core businesses from acquisitions as well as through organic initiatives. 
On March 11, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Oclaro, Inc. (“Oclaro”), Prota Merger Sub, Inc., and Prota Merger, LLC, pursuant to which we will acquire Oclaro and Oclaro will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lumentum. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, each issued and outstanding share of Oclaro common stock will be exchanged for $5.60 in cash and 0.0636 of a share of Lumentum common stock, subject to the conditions and restrictions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The total transaction consideration was approximately $1.8 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement. Oclaro stockholders will own approximately 16% of the combined company following the closing. Oclaro’s stockholders approved the Merger Agreement on July 10, 2018 and we have received approval for the transaction under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act in the United States. We are in the process of obtaining antitrust approval in China. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Lumentum and Oclaro. The Merger Agreement further provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances relating to failure to obtain regulatory approvals, Lumentum may be required to pay Oclaro a termination fee of $80 million.

Restructuring Programs
We continue to engage in targeted restructuring plans primarily intended to reduce costs, consolidate our operations, rationalize the manufacturing of our products and align our business in response to market needs. We have focused on improving efficiencies and reducing costs by consolidating operations where appropriate, while taking into consideration our current investment strategy, product offerings, core competencies, opportunities to enhance cost efficiency and the availability of alternative manufacturers, as appropriate. 
Please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 14. Restructuring and Related Charges” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on restructuring charges. 
Research and Development
During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred R&D expenses of $156.8 million, $148.3 million and $141.1 million, respectively. The number of employees engaged in R&D was approximately 587 as of June 30, 2018, 598 as of July 1, 2017 and 570 as of July 2, 2016.
We devote substantial resources to R&D for the development of new and enhanced products to serve our markets. Once the design of a product is complete, our engineering efforts shift to enhancing both product performance and our ability to manufacture it in greater volume and at lower cost.
In our OpComms segment, we are maintaining our capability to provide products throughout the network, while focusing on several important sub-segments. We are increasing our emphasis on Datacom products, such as 100G and 400G transceivers while we continue to maintain strong investments in Telecom components and modules such as ROADMs and tunable devices needed for long-haul and metro markets. We are also responding to our customers’ requests for higher levels of integration, including the integration of optics, electronics and software in our modules, subsystems and circuit packs. We are providing optical technology for 3D sensing systems that simplify the way that people interact with technology. These solutions are initially being used in computing, mobile, and industrial applications, including automotive applications.
In our Lasers segment, we continue to develop new product offerings in both solid-state and fiber lasers that take advantage of technologies and components we develop. These products are targeted at serving customers engaging in biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, and materials processing and precision micromachining markets.
Manufacturing
Our significant manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, Thailand, and Switzerland. In March 2017, we completed the purchase of a property in Thailand for additional manufacturing capacity for our future growth. 
On March 30, 2018, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”) with one of our contract manufacturers to wind down the production of our products at their facility in China and to facilitate an orderly transition of manufacturing to our manufacturing facility in Thailand, including the purchase of the manufacturing equipment. Under the terms of the TSA, we are required to pay $5.3 million in cash upon completion of certain milestones related to the purchase of equipment. We are also required to share cost of retention and severance, and to reimburse for certain other direct and indirect costs incurred by our contract manufacturer for transition services provided. As of June 30, 2018, we have not acquired any assets under this TSA. Please refer to “Note 6. Asset Acquisition” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Our significant contract manufacturing partners are located primarily in Thailand, Taiwan and China. Contract manufacturers can save a significant amount of dollars on labor, material and other related production expenses. We rely on the capabilities of our contract manufactures to procure the components and manage the inventory in these locations.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We use various suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply parts and components for the manufacture and support of multiple product lines. Although our intention is to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. We may not be able to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices and quality within a reasonable time, or at all; therefore, the risk of loss or interruption of such arrangements could impact our ability to deliver certain products on a timely basis.
9

Intellectual Property
Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets and trademarks. We do not intend to broadly license our intellectual property rights unless we can obtain adequate consideration or enter into acceptable patent cross-license agreements. As of June 30, 2018, we owned 636 U.S. patents and 255 foreign patents with expiration dates ranging from July 2018 through June 2037, and had 193 patent applications pending throughout the world.
Seasonality
Our revenue may be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by customer demand patterns and new product introductions. Some of our products may be incorporated into consumer electronic products, which are subject to seasonality and fluctuations in demand.
Backlog
Backlog consists of purchase orders for products for which we have assigned shipment dates. 
As of June 30, 2018, our backlog was $370.6 million, as compared to $218.4 million as of July 1, 2017. Due to possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders, and because our sales often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter in which they are received, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period.
Employees
As of June 30, 2018, we employed approximately 2,930 full-time employees including approximately 1,900 employees in manufacturing, 587 employees in R&D and 443 employees in SG&A. 
Outside of the United States, our business is subject to labor laws that differ from those in the United States. We follow the statutory requirements of those countries where we operate. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
Environmental
Our R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future.
In connection with the Separation, we agreed to indemnify Viavi for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred to us from Viavi, to the extent the resulting issues primarily related to our business. We have not been presented with any claims to date.
International Operations
During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, net revenue from customers outside the United States based on the geographic region and country where our product is initially shipped, represented 90.8%, 85.2% and 82.0% of net revenue, respectively. In certain circumstances customers may request shipment of our products to a contract manufacturer in one country, which may differ from the location of their end customers. During fiscal 2018, our net revenue from Hong Kong, Mexico, South Korea, and Japan represented 14.7%, 11.7%, 11.7%, and 15.6% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively.
