     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  Our Company 
         HD Supply is one of the largest industrial distributors in North America. We believe we have leading positions in the two distinct market sectors in which we specialize: Maintenance, Repair & Operations ("MRO") and Specialty Construction. These market sectors are large and fragmented, and we believe they present opportunities for significant growth. We aspire to be the "First Choice" of customers, associates, suppliers and the communities in which we operate. This aspiration drives our relentless focus and is reflected in the customer and market centricity, speed and precision, intense teamwork, process excellence and trusted relationships that define our culture. We believe this aspiration distinguishes us from other distributors and has created value for our shareholders, driven above-market growth and delivered attractive returns on invested capital. 
         Through approximately 270 branches and 44 distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada, we serve our markets with an integrated go-to-market strategy. We have approximately 11,500 associates delivering localized, customer-tailored products, services and expertise. We serve approximately 500,000 customers, which include contractors, maintenance professionals, home builders, industrial businesses, and government entities. Our broad range of end-to-end product lines and services include approximately 650,000 stock-keeping units ("SKUs") of quality, name-brand and proprietary-brand products as well as value-add services supporting the entire life-cycle of a project from construction to maintenance, repair and operations. 
         For fiscal 2018, we:
 

 generated $6 billion in Net sales, representing 18.1% growth over fiscal 2017; 
 generated Net income of $394 million in fiscal 2018, as compared to a Net income of $970 million in fiscal 2017, which included a
$732 million gain on sale, net of tax, on the sale of a discontinued business; 
 generated $871 million of Adjusted EBITDA, representing 19.2% growth over fiscal 2017; and 
 generated $619 million of Adjusted net income in fiscal 2018, as compared to $447 million in fiscal 2017. 

         For a reconciliation of Net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income, see "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsKey Business MetricsAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss)." 
         We believe our long-standing customer relationships and competitive advantage stem from our knowledgeable associates, extensive product and service offerings, national footprint, integrated best-in-class technology, broad purchasing scale and strategic supplier relationships. We believe that our comprehensive supply chain solutions improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our customers' businesses. Our value-add services include customer training and certification, material and product fabrication, kitting, jobsite delivery and installation and will-call pickup options. Furthermore, we believe our product application knowledge, comprehensive product assortment, and sourcing expertise allow our customers to perform reliably and give them the tools to enhance profitability. 
         We reach our customers through a variety of sales channels, including professional outside and inside sales forces, call centers and direct marketing programs utilizing market-specific product catalogs, and business unit websites and digital tools. Our distribution network allows us to provide rapid, reliable, on-time delivery and customer pickup throughout the United States and Canada. Additionally, we believe our highly integrated, best-in-class technology provides leading e-commerce and integrated 
 7

   workflow capabilities for our customers, while providing us unparalleled pricing, budgeting, reporting and analytical capabilities across our Company. We believe customers view us as an integral part of the value chain due to our extensive product knowledge, expansive product availability and the ability to directly integrate with their systems and workflows. 
   Our Strategy 
         Since 2007 we have undertaken significant operating and growth initiatives at all levels. We developed and are implementing a multi-year strategy to optimize our business mix. This strategy includes entering new markets and product lines, streamlining and upgrading our process and technology capabilities, acquiring new capabilities and identifying and acquiring acquisition targets that complement our existing businesses. At the same time, we attracted what we believe to be "best of the best" talent, capitalizing on relevant experience, teamwork and change navigation. 
         Both of our businesses invest in high-growth initiatives that align with our five growth plays: 
 

1.Sell
More to Existing Customers (i.e., Share of Wallet)
2.Introduce
New Products and Services
3.Expand
the Channels to Reach Our Customers (e.g., Internet, Catalog, and Mobility)
4.Acquire
New Customers
5.Enter
New Geographies (i.e., Open New Locations) 

         Through investments in these growth plays, we believe we are well-positioned to grow in excess of the markets in which we operate. Specific initiatives focus on increasing penetration within our existing customer base, including the addition of new sales talent across the Company; and the addition of new products and services, including proprietary brands, primarily in our Facilities Maintenance business. We also continue to invest in mobile technologies and e-commerce. We focus primarily on sales talent acquisition, entering new geographies and business combination opportunities to acquire new customers. 
         HD Supply is managed primarily on a product-line basis and reports results of operations in two reportable segments. The reportable segments are Facilities Maintenance and Construction & Industrial. In addition, the consolidated financial statements include "Corporate and Eliminations," which comprises enterprise-wide functional departments that operate in a centralized structure. 
         Facilities Maintenance.    Facilities Maintenance distributes MRO products, provides value-add services and fabricates custom products. Our Facilities Maintenance business unit serves the owners of multifamily, hospitality, healthcare and institutional facilities. Products include electrical and lighting items, plumbing, HVAC products, appliances, janitorial supplies, hardware, kitchen and bath cabinets, window coverings, textiles and guest amenities, healthcare maintenance and water and wastewater treatment products. Facilities Maintenance operates a distribution center-based model that sells its products primarily through a professional sales force, e-commerce and print catalogs. 
         Construction & Industrial.    Construction & Industrial distributes specialized hardware, tools, engineered materials and safety products to non-residential and residential contractors. Service offerings range from pre-bid assistance and product submittals to engineering and tool repair. Construction & Industrial reaches customers through a nationwide network of regionally organized branches as well as print catalogs and e-commerce. Products include tilt-up brace systems, forming and shoring systems, concrete chemicals, hand and power tools, cutting tools, rebar, ladders, safety and fall arrest equipment, specialty screws and fasteners, sealants and adhesives, drainage pipe, geo-synthetics, erosion and sediment control equipment and other engineered materials used broadly across all types of non-residential and residential construction. Construction & Industrial also includes Home 
 8

   Improvement Solutions, which offers light remodeling and construction supplies, kitchen and bath cabinets, windows, plumbing materials, electrical equipment and other products, primarily to small remodeling contractors and trade professionals through local retail outlets. 
         Corporate and Eliminations.    In addition to the reportable segments, our consolidated financial results include "Corporate and Eliminations" which incurs costs related to our centralized support functions, which are comprised of finance, information technology, human resources, legal, supply chain and other support services, and removes inter-segment transactions. All Corporate operating overhead costs are allocated to the reportable segments. Interest expense, interest income, other non-operating income and expenses, and provision for income taxes are not allocated to the reportable segments. The Company does not allocate Corporate assets to its reportable segments. 
   Our Market Sectors 
         We offer a diverse range of products and services to the Maintenance, Repair & Operations and Specialty Construction market sectors in the United States and Canada. The markets in which we operate have a high degree of customer and supplier fragmentation, with customers that typically demand a high level of service and availability of a broad set of complex products from a large number of suppliers. These market dynamics make the distributor a critical element within the value chain. Net sales for HD Supply outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, were $157 million, $146 million, and $124 million in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016, respectively. 
 Maintenance, Repair & Operations 
         In the MRO market sector, our Facilities Maintenance business serves customers across multiple industries by primarily delivering supplies and services needed to maintain and upgrade multifamily, hospitality, healthcare and institutional facilities. Facilities Maintenance is a distribution center-based model. We estimate that this market sector currently represents an addressable market in excess of $55 billion annually with demand driven primarily by ongoing maintenance requirements and property improvement projects of a broad range of living environments and traditional repair and remodeling construction activity across multiple industries. We believe Facilities Maintenance customers value speed and product availability over price. We believe our maintenance, repair and operations business focused on living spaces, including apartment units, hotel or motel rooms and senior care living facilities, provides stable demand, particularly in challenging economic environments, when new construction tends to decrease. 
 Specialty Construction 
         In the Specialty Construction market sector, our Construction & Industrial and Home Improvement Solutions businesses serve professional contractors and trades by meeting their distinct and customized supply needs in non-residential, residential and industrial applications. We estimate that this market sector currently represents an addressable market of approximately $30 billion annually with demand driven primarily by non-residential construction, residential construction, industrial and repair and remodeling construction spending. Construction & Industrial serves this sector through the broad national presence of its regionally organized branch distribution network, as well as branches in six Canadian provinces, while Home Improvement Solutions operates through retail outlets in California primarily serving cash and carry customers. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the continued expansion of non-residential and residential construction end-markets. 
 Our History 
         On July 2, 2013, Holdings completed an initial public offering of 61,170,212 shares of its common stock at a price of $18.00 per share, for an aggregate offering price of $1,039 million, net of 
 9

   underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately $16 million. Upon completion of Holdings' secondary public offerings in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, The Home Depot, Inc. and three private equity firms, collectively our former parent, sold all of their remaining original investment in Holdings. 
         During fiscal 2014, we completed the disposal of Litemor through liquidation. In January 2015, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Hardware Solutions business. In October 2015, we sold our Power Solutions business. In May 2016, we sold our Interior Solutions business. In August 2017, we sold our Waterworks business. For additional information on the discontinued operations, see Note 3, Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within "Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
         In March 2018, we completed the acquisition of A.H. Harris Construction Supplies ("A.H. Harris"), a leading specialty construction distributor serving the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, expanding Construction & Industrial's market presence in the northeastern U.S. For additional information on the acquisition of A.H. Harris, see Note 2, Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within "Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
   Customers and Suppliers 
         We maintain a customer base of approximately 500,000 customers, many of whom represent long-term relationships. We are subject to very low customer concentration with our ten largest customers generating approximately 12.2% of our Net sales in fiscal 2018, reducing our exposure to any single customer. 
         We have developed relationships with approximately 7,000 strategic suppliers, many of which are long-standing. These supplier relationships provide us with reliable access to inventory, volume purchasing benefits and the ability to deliver a diverse product offering on a cost-effective basis. We maintain multiple suppliers for a substantial number of our products, thereby limiting the risk of product shortage for customers. 
   Competition 
         We operate in a highly fragmented industry and hold leading positions in both market sectors. The majority of our competition comes from mid-size regional distributors and small, local distributors; however, we also face competition from a number of national competitors, including Fastenal, Grainger, MSC Industrial, Watsco, Interline Brands (a division of The Home Depot, Inc.), Maintenance Supply Headquarters (a division of Lowe's Companies, Inc.) and Ferguson. 
         We believe the principal competitive factors for our market sectors include local selling capabilities, availability, breadth and cost of materials and supplies, technical knowledge and expertise, value-add service capabilities, customer and supplier relationships, reliability and accuracy of service, effective use of technology, delivery capabilities and timeliness, pricing of products, and the provision of credit. We believe that our competitive strengths and strategy allow us to compete effectively in our market sectors. 
   Seasonality 
         In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, sales of our products have been higher in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions during these periods. Seasonal variations in operating results may also be significantly impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay construction projects and customer deliveries.

   Intellectual property 
         Our trademarks and those of our subsidiaries are registered or otherwise legally protected in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere. We, together with our subsidiaries, own approximately 145 trademarks registered worldwide. We also rely upon trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws, in addition to confidentiality agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information. Generally, registered trademarks have a perpetual life, provided that they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We intend to maintain our material trademark registrations so long as they remain valuable to our business. Other than the trademarks HD Supply ®, USABluebook ®, Seasons ®, Brigade ®, Maintenance Warehouse ® and White Cap ®, we do not believe our business is dependent to a material degree on trademarks, patents, copyrights or trade secrets. Other than commercially available software licenses, we do not believe that any of our licenses for third-party intellectual property are material to our business, taken as a whole. See "Part 1. Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, or we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our ability to compete could be negatively impacted." 
   Employees 
         In domestic and international operations, we had approximately 11,500 employees as of February 3, 2019, consisting of approximately 7,500 hourly personnel and approximately 4,000 salaried employees. 
         As of February 3, 2019, less than 1% of our workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
   Regulation 
         Our operations are affected by various statutes, regulations and laws in the markets in which we operate, which historically have not had a material effect on our business. While we are not engaged in a regulated industry, we are subject to various laws applicable to businesses generally, including laws affecting land usage, zoning, the environment, health and safety, transportation, labor and employment practices, competition, immigration and other matters. Additionally, building codes may affect the 
 11

   products our customers are allowed to use, and consequently, changes in building codes may affect the salability of our products. The transportation and disposal of many of our products are also subject to federal regulations. The DOT regulates our operations in domestic interstate commerce. We are subject to safety requirements governing interstate operations prescribed by the DOT. Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service also remain subject to both federal and state regulation. See "Part 1. Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in U.S. federal, state or local regulations." 
   Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
         We are subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those pertaining to air emissions, water discharges, the handling, disposal and transport of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, the investigation and remediation of contamination and otherwise relating to health and safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources. As our operations, and those of many of the companies we have acquired, to a limited extent involve and have involved the handling, transport and distribution of materials that are, or could be classified as, toxic or hazardous, there is some risk of contamination and environmental damage inherent in our operations and the products we handle, transport and distribute. Our environmental, health and safety liabilities and obligations may result in significant capital expenditures and other costs, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be fined or penalized by regulators for failing to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or we may be held responsible for such failures by companies we have acquired. In addition, contamination resulting from our current or past operations, and those of many of the companies we have acquired, may trigger investigation or remediation obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
