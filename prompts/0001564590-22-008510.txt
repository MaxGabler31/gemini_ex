ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 
 Description of Business and Industry 
 Superior Industries International, Inc.’s (referred to herein as the “Company”, “Superior”, or “we” and “our”) principal business is the design and manufacture of aluminum wheels for sale to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in North America and Europe and to the aftermarket in Europe. We employ approximately 7,800 full-time employees, operating in eight manufacturing facilities in North America and Europe. We are one of the largest aluminum wheel suppliers to global OEMs and we believe we are the #1 European aluminum wheel aftermarket manufacturer and supplier. Our OEM aluminum wheels accounted for approximately 91 percent of our sales in 2021 and are primarily sold for factory installation on vehicle models manufactured by BMW (including Mini), Daimler (Mercedes-Benz, AMG, Smart), Ford, GM, Honda, Jaguar-Land Rover, Lucid Motors, Mazda, Nissan, PSA, Renault, Stellantis, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota, VW Group (Volkswagen, Audi, SEAT, Skoda, Porsche, Bentley) and Volvo. We sell aluminum wheels to the European aftermarket under the brands ATS, RIAL, ALUTEC and ANZIO. North America and Europe represent the principal markets for our products, but we have a diversified global customer base consisting of North American, European and Asian OEMs.  
 Demand for our products is mainly driven by light-vehicle production levels in North America and Europe and customer take rates on specific vehicle platforms that we serve and wheel SKUs that we produce. North American light-vehicle production in 2021 was 13.0 million vehicles, as compared to 13.0 million and 16.3 million vehicles in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In Western and Central Europe, light-vehicle production in 2021 was 12.7 million vehicles, as compared to 13.6 million and 17.8 million vehicles in 2020 and 2019, respectively. While industry production volumes in 2020 were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 2021 volumes were constrained by the semiconductor chip shortage which emerged in the first two quarters of 2021 and worsened in the last half of the year. 
 The majority of our customers’ wheel programs are awarded two to four years before actual production is scheduled to begin. Our purchase orders with OEMs are typically specific to a particular vehicle model. Each year, the automotive manufacturers introduce new models, update existing models and discontinue certain models. In this process, we may be selected as the supplier on a new model, we may continue as the supplier on an updated model or we may lose the supply contract for a new or updated model to a competitor.
 Customer Dependence 
 We have proven our ability to be a consistent producer of high-quality aluminum wheels with the capability to meet our customers’ requirements regarding delivery, overall customer service, price, quality, and technology. We continually strive to enhance our relationships with our customers through continuous improvement programs, not only through our manufacturing operations but in the engineering, design, development and quality areas as well. 
 GM, VW Group and Ford were our only customers individually accounting for 10 percent or more of our consolidated sales in 2021 and 2020. Our sales to these customers in 2021 and 2020 were as follows: 
 
 
 | 2021 | 2020 | 
----------------------+------------------+---------+------
(Dollars in millions) | Percent of Sales | Dollars | | Percent of Sales | | Dollars | 
GM | 26% | $ | 362.3 | | 24% | | $ | 274.2
VW Group | 14% | $ | 194.0 | | 16% | | $ | 175.8
Ford | 13% | $ | 179.0 | | 11% | | $ | 125.0

 
The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to these customers would have a significant adverse effect on our financial results. Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report.
 Raw Materials 
 Aluminum accounted for the vast majority of our total raw material requirements during 2021. Our aluminum requirements are met through purchase orders with major global producers. During 2021, we successfully secured aluminum commitments from our primary suppliers sufficient to meet our production requirements, and we anticipate being able to source aluminum requirements to meet our expected level of production in 2022. 
 We establish price adjustment clauses with our OEM customers to minimize the aluminum price risk. In the aftermarket business, we use derivatives to hedge price variability on our aluminum purchases.

When market conditions warrant, we may also enter into purchase commitments to secure the supply of certain other commodities used in the manufacture of our products, such as natural gas, electricity and other raw materials. 
 Foreign Operations 
 We manufacture all of our North American products in Mexico for sale in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The overall cost for us to manufacture wheels in Mexico is currently lower than in the United States, due to lower labor costs as a result of lower prevailing wage rates. Similarly, we manufacture the majority of our products for the European market in Poland, for sale throughout Europe. Similar to our Mexican operations, the overall cost to manufacture wheels in Poland is substantially lower than in both the United States and Germany at the present time due principally to lower labor costs.
 We may enter into forward contracts, option contracts, swaps, collars or other derivative instruments to hedge the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on expected future cash flows and on certain existing assets and liabilities. In such cases, subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar or the Euro, may hedge a portion of their forecasted foreign currency costs denominated in the Mexican Peso and Polish Zloty, respectively, in order to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our margins. 
 Competition 
 Competition in the market for aluminum wheels is based primarily on delivery, overall customer service, price, quality and technology. We currently supply 17.8 percent and 13.0 percent of the aluminum wheels installed on passenger cars and light-duty trucks in North America and Europe, respectively. 
 Competition is global in nature with a significant volume of exports from Asia into Europe and North America. Some of the key competitors in North America include Central Motor Wheel of America, CITIC Dicastal Co., Ltd., Prime Wheel Corporation, Enkei, Hands Corporation, and Ronal. Key European competitors include Ronal, Borbet, Maxion and CMS. We believe we are the leading manufacturer of alloy wheels in the European aftermarket, where the competition is highly fragmented. Key competitors include Alcar, Brock, Borbet, ATU and Mak.
 Research and Development 
 Our policy is to continuously review, improve and develop our engineering capabilities to satisfy our customer requirements in the most efficient and cost-effective manner available. We strive to achieve this objective by attracting and retaining top engineering talent and by maintaining the latest state-of-the-art computer technology to support engineering development. Our engineering centers located in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Ludensheid, Germany, support our research and development in North America and Europe for our global OEM customers. We also have a technical sales function at our corporate headquarters in Southfield, Michigan that maintains a complement of engineering staff located near some of our largest customers’ headquarters and engineering and purchasing offices. Research and development of our European aftermarket wheels is performed in Bad Durkheim, Germany.
Government Regulation 
 Safety standards in the manufacture of vehicles and automotive equipment have been established under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, as amended. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal standards currently applicable to OEM suppliers and to automotive manufacturers. 
Environmental Compliance 
 Our manufacturing facilities, like most other manufacturing companies, are subject to solid waste, water and air pollution control standards mandated by federal, state and local laws. Violators of these laws are subject to fines and, in extreme cases, plant closure. We believe our facilities are in material compliance with all presently applicable standards. The cost of environmental compliance was approximately $3.0 million in 2021 and $1.3 million in 2020. We expect that future environmental compliance expenditures will approximate these levels and will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of “greenhouse gases” could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the vehicles that use our products. Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors - We are subject to various environmental laws” of this Annual Report.

Sustainability
Superior conducted an assessment in 2021 to identify the sustainability interests of our stakeholders and inform our sustainability strategy. Superior is committed to reducing natural gas, electricity, and water consumption, solid waste and air emissions at all of our facilities globally. All Superior manufacturing plants have implemented Environmental Management Systems that are ISO14001 certified and are subject to annual audits by an independent third party. 
 In 2021, we assessed the carbon footprint for each of our operations globally in connection with our Communication on Progress report to the UN Global Compact published in June 2021. These assessments are helping us identify potential opportunities to:
  
• | reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | offer low or zero carbon wheels to our customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 Superior has established a goal to be carbon neutral by 2039 and we anticipate that by 2025 we will have reduced our emissions 40% from the level generated in 2020.    
 Superior also reported through Carbon Disclosure Project’s (“CDP”) climate change and water security sections in 2021. Furthermore, our research and development team is developing automotive light weighting solutions, such as our patented Alulite™ technology, and aerodynamic solutions that will assist in reducing our customers’ carbon footprint. We continue to collaborate with our customers and suppliers regarding sustainability practices throughout their supply chains. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 7,800 full-time employees, with 4,500 employees in North America and 3,300 employees in Europe.
Segment Information 
 We have aligned our executive management structure, organization and operations to focus on our performance in our North American and European regions. Financial information about our reporting segments is contained in Note 5, “Business Segments” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. 
History 
 We were initially incorporated in Delaware in 1969. Our entry into the OEM aluminum wheel business in 1973 resulted from our successful development of manufacturing technology, quality control and quality assurance techniques that enabled us to satisfy the quality and volume requirements of the OEM market for aluminum wheels. The first aluminum wheel for a domestic OEM customer was a Mustang wheel for Ford. On May 30, 2017, we acquired a majority interest in UNIWHEELS, AG, which was a European supplier of OEM and aftermarket aluminum wheels. UNIWHEELS, AG was renamed in 2018 to Superior Industries Europe AG. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “SUP.”
