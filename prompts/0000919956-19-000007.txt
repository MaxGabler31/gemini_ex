ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introductory Summary.
Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. provides post-acute care services to skilled nursing facilities, referred to as "skilled nursing centers," "nursing centers," or "centers," patients and residents in ten states, primarily in the Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest United States. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references herein to “Diversicare,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” include Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. and all of our consolidated subsidiaries. Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1994.
The post-acute care profession encompasses a broad range of non-institutional and institutional services. For those among the aging, infirmed, or disabled requiring temporary or limited special services, a variety of home care options exist. As the need for assistance in activities of daily living develop, assisted living centers become the most viable and cost effective option. For those amongst the aging, disabled, or infirmed requiring more extensive assistance and intensive care, skilled nursing center care may become the only viable option. We have chosen to focus our business primarily on the skilled nursing centers sector and to specialize in this aspect of the post-acute care continuum.
Principal Address and Website.
Our principal executive offices are located at 1621 Galleria Boulevard, Brentwood, Tennessee 37027. Our telephone number at that address is 615.771.7575, and our facsimile number is 615.771.7409. Our website is located at www.dvcr.com. The information on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Operating and Growth Strategy.
Our operating objective is to optimize market position in the delivery of health care and related services to the patients and residents in need of post-acute care in the communities in which we operate. Our strategic operations development plan focuses on (i) providing a broad range of high quality, cost-effective post-acute care services; (ii) improving skilled mix in our nursing centers via enhanced capabilities for rehabilitation and transitional care; (iii) building clinical competencies and programs consistent with marketplace needs; and (iv) clustering our operations on a regional basis. Interwoven into our objectives and operating strategy is our mission:
• Improve Every Life We Touch 
• Provide Exceptional Healthcare 
• Exceed Expectations
• Increase Shareholder Value
Strategic operating initiatives. Our key strategic operating initiatives include improving skilled mix in our nursing centers by enhancing our staffing complement to address the increased medical complexity of certain patients, increasing clinical competencies, and adding clinical programs. Our investments in nursing and clinical care have been implemented in concert with additional investments in nursing center-based sales representatives to cultivate referral and Managed Care relationships. These investments have positioned us and are expected to continue to position us to be a destination for patients covered by Medicare and Managed Care as well as certain private pay individuals. These enhancements and investments have positioned us to admit higher acuity patients. 
To achieve our objectives, we:
Provide a broad range of quality cost-effective services. Our objective is to provide a variety of services to meet the needs of the increasing post-acute care population requiring skilled nursing and rehabilitation care. Our service offerings currently include skilled nursing, comprehensive rehabilitation services, programming for Life Steps and Memory Care units (described below) and other specialty programming. By addressing varying levels of acuity, we work to meet the needs of the population we serve. We seek to establish a reputation as the provider of choice in each of our markets. Furthermore, we believe we are able to deliver quality services cost-effectively, compared to other healthcare providers along the spectrum of care, thereby expanding the population base that can benefit from our services.
Improve skilled mix in our nursing centers. By enhancing our registered nurse coverage and adding specialized clinical care, we believe we can admit patients with more medically complex conditions, thereby improving skilled mix and reimbursement. The investments in nursing and clinical care are being conducted in concert with additional investments in nursing center-based sales representatives to develop referral and Managed Care relationships. These investments will better attract quality payor sources for patients covered by Medicare, Managed Care and Medicare replacement payors as well as certain private 
1

pay individuals. We will also continue our program for the renovation and improvement of our nursing centers to attract and retain patients and residents. 
Cluster operations on a regional basis. We have developed regional concentrations of operations in order to achieve operating efficiencies, generate economies of scale and capitalize on marketing opportunities created by having multiple operations in a regional market area.
Key elements of our strategy are to: 
Increase revenues and profitability at existing nursing centers. Our strategy includes increasing center revenues and profitability through improving payor mix, providing an increasing level of higher acuity care, obtaining appropriate reimbursement for the care we provide, and providing high quality patient care. Ongoing investments are being made in expanded nursing and clinical care. We continue to enhance center-based marketing initiatives to promote higher occupancy levels and improved skilled mix at our nursing centers. 
Development of additional specialty services. Our strategy includes the development of additional specialty units and programming in nursing centers that could benefit from these services. The specialty programming will vary depending on the needs of the specific market, and may include complex medical and rehabilitation services, as well as memory care units and other specialty programming. These services allow our centers to meet market needs while improving census and payor mix. A center specific assessment of the market and the current programming being offered is conducted related to specialty programming to determine if unmet needs exist as a predictor of the success of particular niche offerings and services.
Strategic management of our portfolio of centers. We continue to pursue and investigate opportunities to acquire and lease new centers, focusing primarily on opportunities that can leverage our existing infrastructure. We routinely evaluate the performance of our existing centers within the markets in which we operate in order to determine whether continuing operations within certain centers or markets aligns with our strategic objectives.
Nursing Centers and Services.
Diversicare provides a broad range of post-acute care services to patients and residents including skilled nursing, ancillary health care services and assisted living. In addition to the nursing and social services usually provided in long-term care centers, we offer a variety of rehabilitative, nutritional, respiratory, and other specialized ancillary services. As of December 31, 2018, our continuing operations consist of 72 nursing centers with 8,214 licensed skilled nursing beds. Our nursing centers range in size from 48 to 320 licensed nursing beds. The licensed nursing bed count does not include 429 licensed assisted living beds. Our continuing operations include centers in Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas.

____________

(1) | The number of Licensed Nursing Beds is based on the regulatory licenses for the nursing center. The Company reports its occupancy based on licensed nursing beds. The number of Available Nursing Beds represents Licensed Nursing Beds reduced by beds removed from service. Available Nursing Beds is subject to change based upon the needs of the centers, including configuration of patient rooms, common usage areas and offices, status of beds (private, semi-private, ward, etc.) and renovations. The number of Licensed and Available Nursing Beds does not include 429 Licensed Assisted Living/Residential Beds, all of which are also available. These beds are excluded from the bed counts as our operating statistics such as occupancy are calculated using Nursing Beds only. 

Our nursing centers provide skilled nursing health care services, including nutrition services, recreational therapy, social services, housekeeping and laundry services. Skilled nursing care is provided for post-acute patients and residents with comorbidities. This care includes assessment using evidence based tools; individualized care plan development based on identified areas of risk and care needs; and skilled interventions such as IV services. We also provide for the delivery of ancillary medical services at the nursing centers we operate. These specialty services include rehabilitation therapy services, such as audiology, speech, occupational and physical therapies, which are provided through licensed therapists and registered nurses, and the provision of medical supplies, nutritional support, infusion therapies and related clinical services. The majority of these services are provided using our internal resources and clinicians.
Within the framework of a nursing center, we may provide other specialty care, including:
Transitional Care Unit. Many of our nursing centers have units designated as transitional care units, our designation for patients requiring transitional care following an acute stay in the hospital. These units specialize in short-term nursing and rehabilitation with the goal of returning the patient to their highest potential level of functionality. These units provide enhanced services with emphasis on upgraded amenities. The design and programming of the units generally appeal to the clinical and hospitality needs of individuals as they progress to the next appropriate level of care. Specialized therapeutic treatment regimens include orthopedic rehabilitation, neurological rehabilitation and complex medical rehabilitation. While these patients generally have a shorter length of stay, the intensive level of nursing and rehabilitation required by these patients typically results in higher levels of reimbursement.
Memory Care Unit. Like our transitional care units, many of our nursing centers have memory care units, our designation for advanced care for dementia-related disorders including Alzheimer's disease. The goal of the units is to provide a safe, homelike and supportive environment for cognitively impaired patients, utilizing an interdisciplinary team approach. Family and community involvement complement structured programming in the secure environment instrumental in fostering as much resident independence and purposeful quality of life as long as possible despite diminished capacity.
Enhanced Therapy Services. We have complemented our traditional therapy services with programs that provide electrotherapy, vital stimulation, ultrasound and shortwave diathermy therapy treatments that promote pain management, wound healing, 
3

muscle strengthening, and/or contractures management, improving outcomes for our patients and residents receiving therapy treatments. 
Other Specialty Programming. We implement other specialty programming based on a center's specific needs. We have developed two adult day care centers on nursing center campuses. We have developed specialty programming for bariatric patients (generally, patients weighing more than 350 pounds) at one of these centers as these individuals have unique psychosocial and equipment needs. 
Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement. We have in place a Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (“QAPI”) program, which is focused on monitoring and improving all aspects of the care provided in a center by identifying outcomes and acting on areas of improvement. The QAPI program in our centers addresses all systems of care and management practices. Key quality indicators are determined and performance goals and benchmarks are established based on industry research standards via a Balanced Scorecard. Gaps and opportunities in performance versus benchmarks are addressed with analysis and performance improvement plans. Outcomes from each center in the areas of quality, employee workplace, customer satisfaction, and stewardship are collected monthly and overseen by regional and company quality committees. 
Utilization of Electronic Medical Records. Electronic Medical Records (“EMR”) improves our ability to accurately record the care provided to our patients and quickly respond to areas of need. We now implement the use of EMR near the time of acquisition for new centers. EMR improves customer and employee satisfaction, nursing center regulatory compliance and provides real-time monitoring and scheduling of care delivery. We believe our EMR system supports our quality initiatives and positions us for higher acuity service offerings. Our EMR system is comprehensive in its functionality, providing key components, such as: 

• | Tracking Activities of Daily Living (“ADLs”). ADLs are the functions that each person must perform on a daily basis including, but not limited to, getting dressed, bathing, and eating. ADL tracking allows us to capture the provision of care provided by our nursing, dietary and housekeeping staff in assisting with ADLs quickly, efficiently and electronically. 


• | Progress Notes. Progress notes are an important component of our medical records. Licensed nursing professionals provide documentation reflecting assessment of each patient's condition and intervention of skilled care provided. The EMR system provides means for a comprehensive chronological record resulting in improved capture, monitoring and review of documentation of condition and care provided. 


• | Medications. Our patients receive a number of daily medications. This module assists with electronic tracking and documenting of required medications and treatments. This provides a more accurate and efficient care system for our nurses and patients. 


• | Wound Module. This allows for an evidence-based risk assessment to drive patient specific interventions to prevent skin breakdown. When skin abnormalities are present, it provides for accurate depiction of anatomical location and description which drives individualized care treatments. 


• | Incident Module. Allows for capturing any event, such as a fall, and provides quality assurance steps for root cause and patient-specific care plans. 

For all modules, the EMR system provides a dashboard that can be reviewed at a number of kiosks throughout the nursing center, allowing our staff to securely access a list of upcoming patient care tasks and providing supervisors a tool to help manage and monitor staff performance. We believe the EMR system provides better support, efficiency, and improves the quality of care for our patients. 
Organization. Our nursing centers are currently organized into eight regions, each of which is supervised by a regional vice president. The regional vice president is generally supported by specialists in several functions, including clinical, human resources, marketing, revenue cycle management and administration, all of whom are employed by us. The day-to-day operations of each of our nursing centers are led by an on-site, licensed administrator. The administrator of each nursing center is supported by other professional personnel, including a medical director, who assists in the medical management of the nursing center, and a director of nursing, who supervises a team of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and nurse aides. Other personnel include those providing therapy, dietary, activities and social service, housekeeping, laundry, maintenance and office services. The majority of personnel at our nursing centers, including the administrators, are our employees.

Marketing.
We believe that skilled nursing care is fundamentally a local business in which both patients and their referral sources are typically based in the immediate geographic area in which the nursing center is located. Our marketing plan and related support activities emphasize the role and contributions of the administrators, admissions coordinators and clinical liaisons of each nursing center, all of whom are responsible for developing relationships with various referral sources such as doctors, hospitals, hospital case managers and discharge planners, and various healthcare and community organizations. Training, sales tools and job aids are provided for the sales and marketing teams for the product knowledge, market knowledge, and selling skills necessary to support their efforts in the field. As part of our business strategy, we have dedicated sales and marketing personnel who develop strong partnerships with physicians and hospital executives as well as Accountable Care Organizations ("ACO"), Bundled Payments for Care Improvement ("BPCI"), and Managed Care organizations. We believe these relationships will be mutually beneficial, providing the community with high quality healthcare while helping customers to navigate choices, manage transitions, and control costs.
At the local level, our sales and marketing efforts are designed to:
•Identify and develop strong healthcare partnerships
•Help facilitate smooth transitions between care settings
•Promote collaboration with ACOs, BPCIs, and healthcare organizations
•Educate referral sources and community on our key differentiators and capabilities 
•Position ourselves as a valuable resource and healthcare partner
•Enhance the customer experience
•Contribute to a strong community presence
•Promote higher occupancy levels
•Foster optimal payor mix
In addition to soliciting admissions from current and potential referral sources, we emphasize involvement in community and healthcare events and opportunities to promote a public awareness of our nursing centers and services. Activities include ongoing family councils and community based “family night” functions, providing the opportunity to educate the public on various topics such as Medicare benefits, powers of attorney, and other topics of interest. We also promote a positive customer experience, best practices, strong surveys, and a high Star Rating; we seek feedback through third-party resident and family surveys. We host tour and “open house” opportunities, where members of the local community are invited to visit the center to see any improvements or to better understand our environment and services. We look for ways to offer increased clinical capabilities and services to better meet the needs of the community and referral sources. In addition, we have regional oversight to support the overall marketing strategies in each local center, in order to promote higher occupancy levels and improved payor and case mixes at our nursing centers. We offer the resources and metrics for strong healthcare partnerships with our referral sources, including ACOs and other Managed Care partners. Our support center marketing personnel support regional and local marketing personnel and efforts.
We have monthly marketing programs and ongoing marketing initiatives, developed internally, that focus on educating and meeting the needs of our customers while growing our business. Resources are also available to assist each nursing center administrator in analysis of local demographics and competition with a view toward complementary service development. We consider the primary referral area in long-term care to generally lie within a five-to-fifteen-mile radius of each nursing center depending on population density; consequently, we focus on local marketing efforts rather than broad-based advertising.
Acquisitions, Divestitures and Significant Transactions. 
Acquisitions
Effective July 1, 2017, the Company acquired a 103-bed skilled nursing center in Selma, Alabama, for an aggregate purchase price of $8.8 million, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement with Park Place Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, LLC, Dunn Nursing Home, Inc., Wood Properties of Selma LLC, and Homewood of Selma, LLC.
Disposals
On October 30, 2018, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with Fulton Nursing and Rehabilitation LLC, Holiday Fulton Propco LLC, Birchwood Nursing and Rehabilitation LLC, Padgett Clinton Propco LLC, Westwood Nursing and Rehabilitation LLC, and Westwood Glasgow Propco (the "Buyers") to sell the assets and transfer the operations of Diversicare of Fulton, LLC, Diversicare of Clinton, LLC and Diversicare of Glasgow, LLC (the "Kentucky Properties"). On December 1, 2018, the Company completed the sale of the Properties with the Buyers for a purchase price of $18.7 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. This transaction did not meet the accounting criteria to be reported as 
5

a discontinued operation. The carrying value of these centers' assets were $13.3 million, and resulted in a gain of $4.8 million. The proceeds were used to relieve debt, as required under the terms of the Company's debt agreements.
Lease Agreements
On October 1, 2018, the Company entered into a New Master Lease Agreement (the "Lease") with Omega Healthcare Investors (the "Lessor") to lease 34 centers currently owned by Omega and operated by Diversicare. The old Master Lease with Omega provided for its operation of 23 skilled nursing centers in Texas, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee, Florida, and Ohio. Additionally, Diversicare operated 11 centers owned by Omega under separate leases in Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio. The Lease entered into by Diversicare and Omega consolidated the leases for all 34 centers under one New Maser Lease. The Lease has an initial term of twelve years with two 10 year extensions, each at our option. The Lease has fixed annual rent escalators of 2.15% beginning on October 1, 2019.
Lease Terminations
On July 8, 2018, the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with ALS Ontario Operating, Inc. to transfer all of the issued and outstanding membership units of Ontario Pointe, a stand-alone 50 bed assisted living facility located in Ontario, Ohio. The transfer of operations and termination of this lease was effective on October 1, 2018. 
Effective September 30, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement with Trend Health and Rehab of Carthage, LLC ("Trend Health") to terminate the lease and the Company's right of possession of the center in Carthage, Mississippi. In consideration of the early termination of the lease, Trend Health provided the Company with a $0.3 million cash termination payment.
Effective May 31, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement with Avon Ohio, LLC to amend the original lease agreement, thus terminating the Company's right of possession of the center located in Avon, Ohio. As a result, the Company incurred lease termination costs of $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2016. Under the amended agreement, the Company is required to pay $0.3 million per year through the term of the original lease agreement, July 31, 2024. 
Under current accounting guidance, these transactions were not reported as discontinued operations, as the disposals did not represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results.
Pharmacy Partnership
Effective October 28, 2016, the Company and its partners entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell the pharmacy joint venture. The sale resulted in a $1.4 million gain in the fourth quarter of 2016. Subsequently, the Company recognized additional gains of $0.3 million and $0.7 million for the years end December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the continuing liquidation of remaining net assets affiliated with the partnership.
Nursing Center Industry.
We believe there are a number of significant trends within the post-acute care industry that will support the continued growth of the nursing center profession. These trends are also likely to impact our business. These factors include:
Demographic trends. The primary market for our post-acute health care services is comprised of persons aged 75 and older. This age group is one of the fastest growing segments of the United States population. As the number of persons aged 75 and over continues to grow, we believe that there will be corresponding increases in the number of persons who need skilled nursing care.
Cost containment pressures. In response to rapidly rising health care costs, governmental and other third-party payors have adopted cost-containment measures to reduce admissions and encourage reduced lengths of stays in hospitals and other acute care settings. As a result, hospitals are discharging patients earlier and referring elderly patients, who may be too sick or frail to manage their lives without assistance, to nursing centers where the cost of providing care is typically lower than hospital care. 
Limited supply of centers. As the nation's population of seniors continues to grow, life expectancy continues to expand, there continue to be limitations on granting Certificates of Need (“CON”) in most states for new skilled nursing centers, we believe that there will be continued demand for skilled nursing beds in the markets in which we operate. CON laws generally require a state agency to determine public need for any construction or expansion of healthcare facilities. We believe that the CON process tends to restrict the supply and availability of licensed skilled nursing center beds. High construction costs, limitations on state and federal government reimbursement for the full costs of construction, and start-up expenses also act to restrict growth in the supply for such centers. 
Reduced reliance on family care. Historically, the family has been the primary provider of care for seniors. We believe that the increase in the percentage of dual income families, the reduction of average family size and the increased mobility in society 
6

will reduce the role of the family as the traditional care-giver for aging parents. We believe that this trend will make it necessary for many seniors to look outside the family for assistance as they age.
Competition.
The post-acute care business is highly competitive. We face direct competition for additional centers, and our centers face competition for employees and patients. Some of our present and potential competitors for acquisitions are significantly larger and have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources. Competing companies may offer new or more modern centers or new or different services that may be more attractive to patients than some of the services we offer.
The nursing centers operated by us compete with other centers in their respective markets, including rehabilitation hospitals and other skilled and personal care residential centers. In the few urban markets in which we operate, some of the long-term care providers with which our centers compete are significantly larger and have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than our centers. Some of these providers are not-for-profit organizations with access to sources of funds not available to our centers. Construction of new long-term care centers near our existing centers could adversely affect our business. We believe that the most important competitive factors in the long-term care business are: a nursing center's local reputation with referral sources, such as acute care hospitals, physicians, religious groups, other community organizations, Managed Care organizations, and a patient's family and friends; physical plant condition; the ability to identify and meet particular care needs in the community; the availability of qualified personnel to provide the requisite care; and the rates charged for services. There is limited, if any, price competition with respect to Medicaid and Medicare patients, since revenues for services to such patients are strictly controlled and are based on fixed rates and cost reimbursement principles. Although the degree of success with which our centers compete varies from location to location, we believe that our centers generally compete effectively with respect to these factors.
Revenue Sources
We classify our revenues earned from patients and residents into four major categories: Medicaid, Medicare, managed care, and private pay and other. Medicaid revenues are those received under the traditional Medicaid program, which provides benefits to those in need of financial assistance in the securing of medical services. Medicare revenues include revenues received under both Part A and Part B. Managed Care revenues are received from insurance entities, including third-party plans that administer Medicare benefits, known as Medicare Advantage plans. The private pay and other revenues are composed primarily of individuals or parties who directly pay for their services. Included in the private pay and other category are patients who are hospice beneficiaries as well as the recipients of Veterans Administration benefits. Veterans Administration payments are made pursuant to renewable contracts negotiated with these payors.
The following table sets forth net patient revenues related to our continuing operations by payor source for the periods presented (dollar amounts in thousands): The amounts as reported for revenue in 2018 differ from the method of accounting in prior years due to the implementation of Accounting Standards Codification 606, the new revenue recognition standard. A comparison of reported revenues to legacy GAAP revenues has been provided below. Refer to Note 3, "Revenue Recognition and Receivables" to the consolidated financial statements.

The following table sets forth average daily skilled nursing census, or average number of patients per day, by payor source for our continuing operations for the periods presented:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | 2017 | | 2016
Medicaid | 4,634 | | 69.2 | % | 4,681 | 69.1 | % | 3,448 | 68.1 | %
Medicare | 709 | | 10.6 | % | 760 | 11.2 | % | 591 | 11.7 | %
Managed Care | 278 | | 4.1 | % | 265 | 3.9 | % | 178 | 3.5 | %
Private Pay and other | 1,076 | | 16.1 | % | 1,072 | 15.8 | % | 844 | 16.7 | %
Total | 6,697 | | 100.0 | % | 6,778 | 100.0 | % | 5,061 | 100.0 | %

Consistent with the nursing center industry in general, changes in the mix of a center's patient population among Medicaid, Medicare, Managed Care, and private pay and other can significantly affect the profitability of the center's operations. However, private payors, including managed care payors, are increasingly demanding that providers accept discounted fees or assume all or a portion of the financial risk for the delivery of health care services. Such measures may include capitated payments, which can result in significant losses to health care providers if patients require expensive treatment not adequately covered by the capitated rate.
Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement
A significant portion of our revenues are derived from government-sponsored health insurance programs, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. We employ third-party specialists in reimbursement and also use these services to monitor regulatory developments to comply with reporting requirements and to ensure that proper payments are made to our operated nursing centers.
Medicare
Medicare is a federally-funded and administered health insurance program for the aged and for certain chronically disabled individuals. Part A of the Medicare program covers certain services furnished by skilled nursing centers and other institutional providers and inpatient hospital services. Part B covers physician services, durable medical equipment, various outpatient services and certain ancillary services. Medicare generally covers skilled nursing center services for beneficiaries who require nursing care or rehabilitation services after a qualifying hospital stay. Medicare pays a per diem rate for each beneficiary, adjusted for patient acuity and additional factors such as geographic differences in wage rates. The payment rates are set forth under a prospective payment system that uses nursing and therapy indexes to assign a payment rate to each beneficiary. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) updates the rates annually. The payment rates cover all services to be provided to a beneficiary, including room and board, skilled nursing care, therapy, and medications.
Skilled nursing facilities. In a final rule issued in July 2018, CMS set forth Medicare payment rates for skilled nursing facilities for federal fiscal year 2018 and updated the skilled nursing facility (“SNF”) market basket percentage to 2.4%, as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. In addition, CMS replaced the existing Resource Utilization Group (“RUG-IV”) case-mix classification system with the Patient-Driven Payment Model (“PDPM”). The PDPM classifies residents in Part A-covered stays into payment groups based on clinically relevant factors using diagnosis codes, rather than by the volume of services. The PDPM case-mix classification system will be effective October 1, 2019. CMS has stated that it does not intend for the new model to change the aggregate amount of Medicare payments to SNFs. Rather, it intends the new model to more accurately reflect resource utilization.
In addition to the adjustments described above, payment rates are reduced pursuant to ongoing sequestration. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (“BCA”) requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, including Medicare spending reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. CMS began imposing a 2% reduction on Medicare claims in April 2013, and these reductions have been extended through 2027.
CMS has increasingly introduced policies intended to shift Medicare to value-based payment methodologies, tying reimbursement to quality of care rather than quantity. For example, CMS has implemented the Quality Reporting Program, under which skilled nursing centers are required to report quality data. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2018, skilled nursing centers that fail to submit required data are subject to a 2% reduction to the annual market basket update. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2019, the Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (“SNF VBP”) Program makes incentive payments available to skilled nursing centers based on their past performance on a specified quality measure related to hospital readmissions. CMS funds the SNF VPB Program incentive payment pool by withholding 2% of skilled nursing center payments and then redistributing the withheld payments. Data from the calendar year 2017 performance period will be used to calculate incentive payments for federal fiscal year 2019. Going forward, data collected from each performance period will affect Medicare payments two years later.
8

CMS publishes rankings based on performance scores on the Nursing Home Compare website, which is intended to assist the public in finding and comparing skilled care providers. The Nursing Home Compare website also publishes for each nursing home a rating between 1 and 5 stars as part of CMS’s Five-Star Quality Rating System. An overall star rating is determined based on three components (information from the last three years of health inspections, staffing information, and quality measures), each of which also has its own five-star rating. The ratings are based, in part, on the quality data nursing centers are required to report. For example, nursing centers must report the percentage of short-stay residents who are successfully discharged into the community and the percentage who had an outpatient emergency department visit. We remain diligent in continuing to provide outstanding patient care to achieve high rankings for our centers, as well as assuring that our rankings are correct and appropriately reflect our quality results.
Therapy Services. Reimbursement for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services covered under Medicare Part B is determined according to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”), which is updated annually. For 2019, CMS updated the conversion factor based on the 0.25% increase required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and a budget neutrality adjustment. If a beneficiary receives multiple therapy treatments in one day, Medicare Part B pays the full rate for the therapy unit of service that has the highest Practice Expense (“PE”) component. A multiple procedure payment reduction is applied to the second and subsequent therapy units, reducing reimbursement to 50% of the applicable PE component.
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 repealed the annual per-beneficiary payment limits on therapy services covered under Medicare Part B for services provided after December 31, 2017. Instead, targeted medical reviews are performed when expenses for a beneficiary exceed a threshold of $3,000 for physical and speech therapy services combined or $3,000 for occupational therapy services alone. Deductible and coinsurance amounts paid by the beneficiary for therapy services count toward the amount applied to the limit. Claims above the threshold may be subject to post-payment review of medical necessity documentation by Supplemental Medical Review Contractors.
CMS has implemented value-based programs that affect Medicare payments for physician and other clinician services. Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) required the establishment of the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”), a payment methodology intended to reward high-quality patient care. Beginning in 2017, physicians and certain other clinicians, including therapists beginning in 2019, are required to participate in one of two QPP tracks. Under both tracks, performance data collected in each performance year will affect Medicare payments two years later. The Advanced Alternative Payment Model (“Advanced APM”) track makes incentive payments available for participation in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS. A provider with sufficient participation in an Advanced APM is exempt from the reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the second track, the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”). Providers electing to participate in MIPS will receive either payment incentives or be subject to payment reductions based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities, and meaningful use of electronic health records. MIPS consolidates components of previously established incentive programs, including the Value-Based Payment Modifier program and the Physician Quality Reporting System.
Medicaid 
Medicaid is a medical assistance program for the indigent that is funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states. Federal law requires states to cover certain nursing center services for Medicaid-eligible individuals when other payment options are unavailable. However, Medicaid eligibility requirements and benefits vary by state, and states may impose limitations on nursing services. States may also establish levels of service or payment methodologies by acuity or specialization of a nursing center.
The Affordable Care Act, as currently structured, requires states to expand Medicaid coverage by adjusting eligibility requirements such as income thresholds. However, the Presidential administration and certain members of Congress continue to attempt to repeal or significantly modify the Affordable Care Act, which may result in changes to Medicaid. Further, states may opt out of the Medicaid expansion. Some states use or have applied to use waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. 
For example, effective February 1, 2015, the Company began participating in Indiana's Upper Payment Limit (“UPL”) supplemental payment program, which provides supplemental Medicaid payments for skilled nursing centers that are licensed to non-state government entities such as county hospital districts. One skilled nursing center previously operated by the Company entered into a transaction with one such hospital district participating in the UPL program, providing for the transfer of the license from the Company to the hospital district. The Company’s operating subsidiary retained the management of the center on behalf of the hospital district. The agreement between the hospital district and the Company is terminable by either party.
We receive the majority of our annual Medicaid rate increases during the third quarter of each year. The rate changes received in 2018 and 2017, along with increased Medicaid acuity in our acuity based states, were the primary contributor to our 1.9% increase in average rate per day for Medicaid patients in 2018 compared to 2017. Based on the rate changes received during the third 
9

quarter of 2018, we expect a favorable impact to our rate per day for Medicaid patients as we move into 2019 due to modest rate increases in many of the states within which we operate.
Several states in which we operate face budget shortfalls, which could result in reductions in Medicaid funding for nursing centers. Pressures on state budgets are expected to continue in the future. Certain of the states in which we operate are actively seeking ways to reduce Medicaid spending for nursing center care by such methods as capitated payments and substantial reductions in reimbursement rates. Some states are promoting alternatives such as community and home-based services. CMS administrators have indicated that they intend to increase state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs. We are unable to predict what, if any, reform proposals or reimbursement limitations will be implemented in the future, or the effect such changes would have on our operations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived 24.8% and 52.5% (as adjusted to Legacy GAAP) of our total patient revenues related to continuing operations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, respectively.  Any health care reforms that significantly limit rates of reimbursement under these programs could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our financial position and profitability. 
Employees.
As of February 8, 2019, we employed approximately 8,500 employees, referred to as "team members," in connection with our continuing operations, approximately 6,000 of which are considered full-time team members. We believe that our team member relations are good. Approximately 740 of our team members are represented by a labor union.
Although we believe we are able to employ sufficient nurses and therapists to provide our services, a shortage of health care professional personnel in any of the geographic areas in which we operate could affect our ability to recruit and retain qualified team members and could increase our operating costs. We compete with other health care providers for both professional and non-professional team members and with non-health care providers for non-professional team members. This competition continues to contribute to a consistent increase in the salaries that we have to pay to hire and retain these team members. As is common in the health care industry, we expect the salary and wage increases for our skilled healthcare providers will continue to be higher than average salary and wage increases nationally.
Supplies and Equipment.
We purchase drugs, solutions and other materials and lease certain equipment required in connection with our business from many suppliers. We have not experienced, and do not anticipate that we will experience, any significant difficulty in purchasing supplies or leasing equipment from current suppliers. In the event that such suppliers are unable or fail to sell us supplies or lease equipment, we believe that other suppliers are available to adequately meet our needs at comparable prices. National purchasing contracts are in place for all major supplies, such as food, linens and medical supplies. These contracts assist in maintaining quality, consistency and efficient pricing. Based on contract pricing for food and other supplies, we expect cost increases in 2019 to be relatively the same or slightly lower than the increases we experienced in 2018. 
Government Regulation.
The health care industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. These laws and regulations include, but are not necessarily limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditation, government health care program participation requirements, reimbursement for patient services, quality of patient care and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Over the last several years, government activity has increased with respect to investigations and allegations concerning possible violations by health care providers of a number of statutes and regulations, including those regulating fraud and abuse, false claims, patient privacy and quality of care issues. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in exclusion from government health care programs together with the imposition of significant fines and penalties, as well as significant repayments for patient services previously billed. Compliance with such laws and regulations is subject to ongoing government review and interpretation, as well as regulatory actions in which government agencies seek to impose fines and penalties. The Company is involved in regulatory actions of this type from time to time.
Licensure and Certification.
All our nursing centers must be licensed by the state in which they are located in order to accept patients, regardless of payor source. In most states, nursing centers are subject to CON laws, which require us to obtain government approval for the construction of new nursing centers or the addition of new licensed beds to existing centers. Our nursing centers must comply with detailed statutory and regulatory requirements on an ongoing basis in order to qualify for licensure, as well as for certification as a provider eligible to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Generally, the requirements for licensure and Medicare/Medicaid certification are similar and relate to quality and adequacy of personnel, quality of medical care, record keeping, dietary services, patient rights, and the physical condition of the nursing center and the adequacy of the equipment used therein. Failure 
10

to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
In 2016, CMS published a comprehensive update to the health and safety standards applicable to long-term care facilities participating in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. These revisions are aimed at improving quality of life, care and services in long-term care facilities, optimizing resident safety, and reflecting current professional standards. For example, CMS added requirements related to infection prevention and control, compliance and ethics programs, staff training, and QAPI programs. To allow facilities time to achieve compliance, CMS is implementing the requirements in three phases, over a three year period. We are in substantial compliance with the Phase 1 and Phase 2 requirements, and expect to be in substantial compliance with the Phase 3 requirements by the November 28, 2019 deadline. The total costs associated with implementing the requirements is not known at this time. 
Each center is subject to periodic inspections, known as “surveys” by health care regulators, to determine compliance with all applicable licensure and certification standards. Such requirements are both subjective and subject to change. If the survey concludes that there are deficiencies in compliance, the center is subject to various sanctions, including but not limited to monetary fines and penalties, suspension of new admissions, non-payment for new admissions and loss of licensure or certification. Generally, however, once a center receives written notice of any compliance deficiencies, it may submit a written plan of correction and is given a reasonable opportunity to correct the deficiencies. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to maintain such licenses and certifications for our centers or that we will not be required to expend significant sums in order to comply with regulatory requirements.
Health care and health insurance reform.
In recent years, the U.S. Congress and some state legislatures have considered and enacted significant legislation concerning health care and health insurance. The most prominent of these efforts, The Affordable Care Act, affects how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed. As currently structured, the Affordable Care Act expands coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector reforms, provides for reduced growth in Medicare program spending, and promotes initiatives that tie reimbursement to quality and care coordination. Some of the provisions, such as the requirement that large employers provide health insurance benefits to full-time employees, have increased our operating expenses. The Affordable Care Act expands the role of home-based and community services, which may place downward pressure on our sustaining population of Medicaid patients. Reforms that we believe may have a material impact on the long-term care industry and on our business include, among others, possible modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment, bundling of payments to cover both acute and post-acute care and the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers. However, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act. The Presidential administration and certain members of Congress have made significant changes to the law, its implementation or its interpretation. For example, effective January 1,2019, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate. In addition, final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Because the penalty associated with the individual mandate was eliminated, a federal judge in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the entire law was unconstitutional. However, the law remains in place pending appeal. 
Skilled nursing centers are required to bill Medicare on a consolidated basis for certain items and services that they furnish to patients, regardless of the cost to deliver these services. This consolidated billing requirement essentially makes the skilled nursing center responsible for billing Medicare for all care services delivered to the patient during the length of stay. CMS has instituted a number of test programs designed to extend the reimbursement and financial responsibilities under consolidated billing beyond the traditional discharge date to include a broader set of bundled services. Such examples may include, but are not exclusive to, home health, durable medical equipment, home and community based services, and the cost of re-hospitalizations during a specified bundled period. Currently, these test programs for bundled reimbursement are confined to a small set of clinical conditions, but CMS has indicated that it is developing additional bundled payment models. This bundled form of reimbursement could be extended to a broader range of diagnosis related conditions in the future. The potential impact on skilled nursing center utilization and reimbursement is currently unknown. The process for defining bundled services has not been fully determined by CMS and therefore is subject to change during the rule making process.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) has mandated an extensive set of regulations to standardize electronic patient health, administrative and financial data transactions and to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information (“protected health information”). We have a HIPAA compliance committee and designated privacy and security officers.
11

The HIPAA transaction standards are intended to simplify the electronic claims process and other healthcare transactions by encouraging electronic transmission rather than paper submission. These regulations provide for uniform standards for data reporting, formatting and coding that we must use in certain transactions with health plans. The HIPAA security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. Some of the security regulations are technical in nature, while others are addressed through policies and procedures.
The HIPAA privacy regulations establish comprehensive federal standards relating to the use and disclosure of protected health information. The privacy regulations establish limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information, provide for patients' rights, including rights to access, to request amendment of, and to receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information, and require certain safeguards for protected health information. In addition, each covered entity must contractually bind individuals and entities that furnish services to the covered entity or perform a function on its behalf, and to which the covered entity discloses protected health information, to restrictions on the use and disclosure of that protected health information. Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 calendar days from the discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made to the Department of Health and Human Services and, in certain cases involving large breaches, to the media. In general, the HIPAA regulations do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or grant greater privacy rights to individuals. Thus, we must reconcile the HIPAA regulations and other state privacy laws.
Although we believe that we are in material compliance with these HIPAA regulations, inadvertent violations of these regulations may occur in the course of our business. For this and other reasons, the HIPAA regulations are expected to continue to impact us operationally and financially and may pose increased regulatory risk.
Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation.
The health care industry is subject to state and federal laws that regulate the relationships of providers of health care services, physicians and other clinicians. These self-referral laws impose restrictions on physician referrals to any entity with which they have a financial relationship, which is a broadly defined term. We believe our relationships with physicians are in compliance with the self-referral laws. Failure to comply with self-referral laws could subject us to a range of sanctions, including civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from government reimbursement programs. There are also federal and state laws making it illegal to offer anyone anything of value in return for referral of patients. These laws, generally known as “anti-kickback” laws, are broad and subject to interpretations that are highly fact dependent. Given the lack of clarity of these laws, there can be no absolute assurance that any health care provider, including us, will not be found in violation of the anti-kickback laws in any given factual situation. Strict sanctions, including fines and penalties, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties, may be imposed for violation of the anti-kickback laws.
Secondary Coverage Reporting Obligations
As required by the Medicare Secondary Reporting Act and related laws and regulations, we report to CMS specific information regarding all claimants and claim settlements involving Medicare participants so CMS can recover Medicare funds expended to provide healthcare treatment to the claimant. The requirements are to ensure that CMS is notified so that it may recoup the amounts paid for services from the settlement proceeds. The requirements do not result in us making additional payments to CMS for these services provided and does not result in an incremental cost to us. Strict sanctions, including fines and penalties, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties, may be imposed for non-compliance with these reporting obligations.
