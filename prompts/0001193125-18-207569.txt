 Item 1. Business
About Korn Ferry 
 Korn/Ferry International (referred to herein as the Company, Korn Ferry, or in the first person notations we, our, and us) is a global organizational consulting firm. We opened our first office in Los Angeles in 1969 and currently operate in 106 offices in 52 countries. We deliver our solutions on a global basis, wherever our clients do business. As of April 30, 2018, we had 7,643 full-time employees, including 1,392 consultants (541 Executive Search, 577 Hay Group (formerly known as Leadership & Talent Consulting (Legacy LTC) which was combined with HG (Luxembourg) S.à.r.l (Legacy Hay) in December 2015), and 274 Futurestep) who are primarily responsible for client services. Our clients include many of the worlds largest and most prestigious public and private companies, middle market and emerging growth companies, as well as government and nonprofit organizations. We have built strong client loyalty with 88% of our assignments performed during fiscal 2018 on behalf of clients for whom we had conducted assignments in the previous three fiscal years. We have made significant investments in our business that have strengthened our intellectual property, enhanced our geographical presence, added complementary offerings to deepen client relationships and broadened our capabilities around talent strategy, assessment, development and rewards. We were originally formed as a California corporation in November 1969 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in fiscal 2000. 
 On June 12, 2018, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan (the Plan) to go to market under a single, master brand architecture and to simplify the Companys organizational structure by eliminating and/or consolidating certain legal entities and implementing a rebranding of the Company to offer the Companys current products and services using the Korn Ferry name, branding and trademarks. In connection with the Plan, the Company intends to sunset all sub-brands, including Futurestep, Hay Group and Lominger, among others. The Company is harmonizing under one brand to help accelerate the firms positioning as the preeminent organizational consultancy and bring more client awareness to its broad range of talent management solutions. While the rebranding will not impact the Companys segment financial reporting, starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company will rename its Hay Group segment as Korn Ferry Advisory and its Futurestep segment as Korn Ferry RPO and Professional Search. The Companys Executive Search segment will remain unchanged. In connection with the Plan, the Company also intends to pursue a holding company reorganization as discussed in further detail below under KF Merger. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion of the Companys business in this Item 1 describes the Companys business as currently operated and does not give effect to any changes that may be implemented as a result of the rebranding plan. The Company intends to update this discussion in its 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect any changes implemented as of such time as a result of the Plan. 
 The Korn Ferry Opportunity 
 Rallied around our vision to be the preeminent organizational consulting firm, at Korn Ferry, we are pursuing an ambitious strategy that will help us to focus relentlessly on clients and collaborate intensively across the organization. This approach builds on the best of our past and gives us a clear path to the future with focused initiatives to increase our client and commercial impact. 
 Korn Ferry is transforming how clients address their spectrum of talent management needs. We have evolved from a mono-line business to a global organizational consulting firm and in the process are giving our consultants more opportunities to engage with clientsbeyond our iconic talent acquisition offering. 
 The essence of our belief is that both Korn Ferry and our clients can be more than. We view it as a state of mind, an attitude, for how we live and interact with each other and our clients every day. Being more than makes a differenceto us, and more importantly, to our clients. More than reflects the vast expertise we bring to our clients. This is the opportunity to bring our services, solutions and products backed by rich intellectual property to our clients, inspiring and motivating individuals, teams, even entire organizations. This is how we bring companies strategies to life, unite boardrooms and workforces, unlock potential, realize ambitions and change lives.

While most organizations can develop a sound strategy, they often struggle with how to make it stick. That is where we come in: synchronizing an organizations strategy with its talent to drive superior performance. We help companies design their organizationthe structure, roles and responsibilitiesto seize these opportunities. As important, we help organizations select and hire the talent they need to execute their strategyand show them the best way to compensate, develop and motivate their people. 
 We do this through our five solution sets: 
 

Organizational Strategy | We map talent strategy to business strategy by designing operating models and organizational structures that align to them, helping organizations put their plans into action. We make sure they have the right people, in the right roles, engaged and enabled to do the right things. 
Assessment and Succession | We provide actionable, research-backed insights that allow organizations to understand the true capabilities of their people so they can make decisions that ensure the right leaders are readywhen and where they are neededin the future. 
Talent Acquisition | From executive search to recruitment process outsourcing, we integrate scientific research with our practical experience and industry-specific expertise to recruit professionals of all levels and functions for client organizations. 
Leadership Development | We activate purpose, vision and strategy through leaders at all levels and organizations. We combine expertise, science and proven techniques with forward thinking and creativity to build leadership experiences that help entry to senior level leaders grow and deliver superior results.
Rewards and Benefits | We help organizations align reward with strategy. We help them pay their people fairly for doing the right thingswith rewards they valueat a cost the organization can afford. 

About Our Intellectual Property and Technology 
 At the core of our service, solution and product delivery is deep intellectual property (IP) and research that allows us to deliver meaningful business outcomes for our clients. 
 The Korn Ferry Institute, our research and analytics arm, unites three areas: agile client execution; applied research and analytics; and breakthrough innovation. These teams work together to help business and public-sector leaders understand the key trends and drivers of human and organizational performance, so that they make better, science-based decisions on critical leadership, people, management and policy issues. 
 The Korn Ferry Institutes core IP data and assets include proprietary leadership assessment, recruitment and development models, emotional and social competencies, human motives and values, job grading, engagement and rewards systems. We integrate and build upon our unique data sets using advanced modeling and artificial intelligence (AI) to produce unique, predictive insights and deliver demonstrable client impact. 
 Our analytics are based on industry leading data sets which include six million assessments, profiles of eight million candidates, compensation data on twenty million professionals and engagement data on more than six million professionals. 
 At the highest level, the Korn Ferry Institute explores three themes: 
 

1. | People, organization and technology innovation;
---+------------------------------------------------


2. | Data analytics for human and business performance; and
---+-------------------------------------------------------


3. | New demographic trends.
---+------------------------

 In the fiscal year ahead, we will continue to integrate, harmonize and simplify our IP for greater leverage and business impact, with the goal of having one science-based engine underlying and empowering all our products and solutions.

About Our Business Segments 
 Korn Ferry services, solutions, and products are delivered through the following business segments: 
 Executive Search: Korn Ferry Executive Search helps clients attract and hire leaders who fit in with their organization and make it stand out. The business is managed by geographical region leaders with a focus on recruiting board-level, chief executive and other senior executive positions for clients predominantly in the consumer, financial services, industrial, life sciences/healthcare provider, technology and educational/not-for-profit market sectors. We also have centers of functional expertise; our Board & CEO Services group, for example, focuses exclusively on placing CEOs and board of directors in organizations around the world. The relationships established by Executive Search allow us to add incremental value to our clients through the delivery of our other organizational consulting services and solutions. 
 Our Executive Search services concentrate on searches for positions with annual cash compensation of $300,000 or more, or comparable compensation in foreign locations. The industry is comprised of retained and contingency recruitment firms. Retained firms, such as Korn Ferry, typically charge a fee for their services equal to approximately one-third of the first-year annual cash compensation for the position being filled regardless of whether the position is filled. Contingency firms generally work on a non-exclusive basis and are compensated only upon successfully placing a recommended candidate. 
 Hay Group: Korn Ferry Hay Group is comprised of 3,454 of the worlds top leadership and organizational advisory consultants and thought leaders. Through our talented colleagues, robust solutions and world-class intellectual property that people use every day, our consultants are able to solve the most disruptive and challenging organizational and talent problems facing clients. 
 As a recognized advisory leader, we partner with many of the worlds most admired organizations because of our track record delivering successful outcomes, our ability to listen, and our insistence on putting our clients first. They depend on our products and platforms every day to connect our solutions to their business challenges. In essence, we help clients design their organizationthe structure, roles and responsibilitiesand show them the best way to compensate, develop and motivate their people. We deliver this through a combination of solutions consulting and product services that addresses how people work and shows how to nurture them so that strategies succeed. We capitalize on the breadth of our IP, service offerings and expertise to do what is right for the client. Services are delivered by an experienced team of consultants and include one of the richest and most comprehensive people data sets. 
 Futurestep: Korn Ferry Futurestep uses data-backed insight and IP, matched with strategic collaboration and innovative technology, to meet people challenges head-onand succeed. Our solutions span all aspects of Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), Professional Search and Project Recruitment. 
 Our scalable, best-in-class approach to RPO allows our clients to attract top people while reducing expenses and time to hire. To us, RPO is more than just handing off the responsibilities of recruitment. Its about building a partnership, often through a co-sourced recruitment model, to discover and deliver the talent that will have the greatest impact on our clients business. 
 Korn Ferry Futurestep offers proven RPO services that are backed by years of experience and award-winning IP. Using a variety of tools, we look closely at each candidate, combining data from multiple recruitment systems to determine which candidates have the potential to match both a particular organization and a specific role. Our customizable end-to-end solutions combine recruiting expertise with state-of-the-art technology platforms and sophisticated methodologies to help clients streamline recruitment processes, enhance candidate experience, and improve quality of hire, ultimately impacting the long-term success of an organization. We see talent acquisition as a critical function of the business, one that impacts not just the bottom line but one that can also drive top line growth. Korn Ferry Futurestep also undertakes Project Recruitment. This solution focuses not on a single hire, nor on filling high-volume roles, but instead the area in between. Project recruitment addresses a specific talent acquisition need at a certain point in time. 
 Through our Professional Search capabilities, Korn Ferry Futurestep is uniquely positioned to help organizations identify and attract professionals at the middle to upper levels of management, in single-search engagements.

 Industry Trends 
 In this competitive global economic environment, our clients are seeking new pathways to drive sustainable profitable growth. CEOs are increasingly demanding an agile workforce that can innovate and drive growth across borders. We believe Korn Ferry is uniquely positioned to help organizations synchronize their strategy with their talent to drive superior performance. 
 Consolidation of Solution ProvidersIn choosing recruitment and human resource service providers, we believe and see evidence to support that: 
 

◾ | Companies are actively in search of preferred providers in order to create efficiencies and consolidate vendor relationships;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Providers that can offer a full suite of organizational consulting products and solutions are becoming increasingly attractive; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Clients seek trusted advisors who understand their business and unique organizational culture in order to manage the multiple needs of their business on a global scale.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Skills GapsThere are not enough highly skilled people coming into the labor market to fill open jobs. Particularly at the senior management levels, the available talent pool is inadequate. New leaders must step into bigger, more complex, and more global roles fasterand with less experiencethan their predecessors. Given this, learning agilityones ability to adapt the lessons learned from previous experiences, solve complex problems, manage amid ambiguity in a constantly changing world and drive changeis more important than ever. We believe employers will increasingly seek service providers who can help them find, develop and retain highly qualified, learning-agile talent to secure a competitive advantage. 
 Human Capital is One of the Top CEO ChallengesHuman capital challenges are found in all industries and sectors, among large and small companies, including those that are taking on the planets most pressing problems: sustainability, security, the environment, energy, transportation, food supply, clean water, and more. Tackling world-changing challenges requires far more than just best-in-class research and development and efficient production processes. More than ever, organizations need world-class talent motivated by a bigger vision. The people, the minds, the alliances and the culture that can create and then nurture innovative ideas are seen as central to the modern CEO agenda. In fact, according to The Conference Board, attracting and retaining talent is the single biggest challenge facing CEOs in 2018. 
 Talent AnalyticsCompanies are increasingly leveraging big data and predictive analytics to measure the influence of activities across all aspects of their business, including Human Resources (HR). They expect their 
 
4 


 

service providers to deliver superior metrics and better ways of communicating results. The Korn Ferry Institutes core IP, data and assets allow us to determine the true drivers of leadership, performance and monitor how any individual or organization measures up. We possess several of the most robust HR databases in the world. These databases enable our clients to benchmark salaries, leadership potential, employee engagement, organizational culture and review other HR data by industry and by position at a global and country level. 
 Increased Outsourcing of Talent Acquisition FunctionsMore companies are focusing on their core competencies and choosing to outsource non-core functions to providers who can offer efficient, high-quality services. Third-party providers can apply immediate and long-term approaches for improving all aspects of talent acquisition. Advantages to outsourcing part or all of the recruitment function include: 
 

◾ | Access to a diverse and highly qualified pool of candidates, which is refreshed on a regular basis;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Reduction or elimination of the costs required to maintain and train an in-house recruiting department in a rapidly changing industry;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Ability to use the workflow methodologies we have developed over tens of thousands of assignments, which allow clients to fulfill positions on a streamlined basis;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Ability to quickly review millions of resumes and provide the right fit for the client;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Access to the most updated industry and geographic market information;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Access to cutting-edge search technology software and proprietary IP; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Ability to maintain management focus on core strategic business issues.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other Industry TrendsIn addition to the industry trends mentioned above, we believe the following factors will have a long-term positive impact on our industry: 
 

◾ | Increasing demand for professionals with not just the right technical skills, but also the right leadership style, values and motivation to meet the specific requirements of the position and organizational culture;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Decreasing executive management tenure and more frequent job changes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Retiring baby boomers, creating a skills gap in the workforce;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Shifting balance of power towards the employee as more people take charge of their own careers, and the new norm of employee-driven development;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Increasing importance of talent mobility in engaging and developing people within an organization;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Increased attention to succession planning due to heightened scrutiny on CEOs, pressure to generate growth, shorter CEO tenures and the emphasis being placed on making succession planning a systemic governance process within global organizations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Executive pay and governance practices under more scrutiny than ever;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | The high turnover rate and varying high volume hiring needs commonly associated with the new shared economy; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Increasing focus on gender pay gap and the lack of women in senior roles.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategy 
 Our objective is to expand our position as the preeminent organizational consulting firm. In order to meet this objective, we will continue to pursue our strategy: 
 Drive an Integrated, Solutions-Based Go-to-Market Strategy 
 Our synergistic go-to-market strategy, bringing together all three of our business segments, is driving more integrated, scalable client relationships. This is evidenced by the fact that approximately 62% of our revenues come from clients that utilize multiple lines of business. To better compete in the market, we will evolve over time from our traditional line of business segmentation to integrated solutions and industries. 
 In an effort to gain operational efficiencies and drive superior performance, we expect that multinational clients will increasingly turn to strategic partners such as Korn Ferry that can manage their needs on a centralized basis. This will require vendors with a global network of offices and technological support systems to manage engagements across geographical regions. We established our Marquee Accounts program to act as a catalyst for change as we transform our Company from individual operators to an integrated solutions provider, in an effort to drive major global and regional strategic account development, as well as to provide a framework for all our client development activities. 
 
5 


 

Our Marquee Accounts program now comprises 20% of our global fee revenues. A number of our Marquee accounts are managed by our newly hired account managers18 at April 30, 2018. In the year ahead, we will continue to grow and expand our account management activities. This includes driving consistent account selection, assignment, planning and execution; implementing account-based marketing efforts; optimizing the pipeline and opportunity process; and hiring additional dedicated account leaders. 
 Deliver Unparalleled Client Excellence 
 Korn Ferry continues to scale and more deeply embed our industry-leading IP within the talent management processes of our global clients. In addition to technology-enabled insights for our clients, we also continue to invest in productivity enhancers for our own colleagues, recognizing that as the way they work changes and becomes more global, we need to make them productive wherever they are and however they work. We are focused on the following key areas to drive our technology plan: 
 InnovationHuman capital management is quickly evolving, thanks to people with new profiles, new technologies and new organizational and working contracts. Korn Ferry is actively investing in some of these developments and closely monitors others to align our business models, capture significant growth opportunities and ultimately help shape the future of work. 
 Market innovations contribute to more accurate, faster, cost-effective and impactful business and human decisions. Our firm is well-positioned in that context. We have a unique set of assets that are critical to such decisions: deep science on organization and human motivation, data on talent, work and rewards, and proven products and solutions. 
 We are integrating these assets and combining them with enhanced computing and analytical power to remain a cutting-edge organizational consulting firm. Some key innovation initiatives include: 
 

◾ | Core IP: Integration of talent and work IP into a single, science-based framework organized along identity (the deepest drivers of human behaviors), capabilities (what people know), and accountabilities (what characteristics of roles, responsibilities and outcomes). We expect to position this model to be a market gold-standard associated with individual and collective performance in traditional organizations as well as in open talent networks. This model will also fuel our advisory solutions such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A), diversity and inclusion (D&I) and digital transformation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Client analytics: Historically, Korn Ferry has developed solidyet traditionaltalent analytics for Marquee clients. We are now developing better correlations between human and business performance for more systematic monetization of client analytics and introduction to new clients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Advanced analytics: We are organizing our data and reports into always-on blended dashboards that will help clients make better decisions. We are also strengthening our AI-machine learning (AI-ML) capacity, initially to optimize recruitment (e.g., sourcing and matching of jobs and talents) and to scale pay-related demographics and data points. We will then use AI-ML to complement our science on individuals, teams and work, and identify the variables that best help transformation and predict talent and organizational results.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 IP Driven Tools and ServicesWe are leveraging all IP and technology and combining into a unified single platform to deliver assessments that allow clients to make faster, better talent decisions. 
 Our IP-driven tools and services are being utilized by our clients for everything from organizational development and job profiling to selection, training, individual and team development, succession planning and more. Our subscription services delivered online help us generate long-term relationships with our clients through large scale and technology-based HR programs on an annuity basis. We continue to seek ways to further scale our product offering to our global clients. 
 Within Executive Search our databases contain profiles of approximately five million executives to assist in identifying individuals with the right background, cultural fit and abilities. Through the search process, we leverage proprietary tools such as our Four Dimensional Executive Assessment and Executive Snapshot (incorporating Hay Groups industry standard job grading, job description and salary benchmark methodologies).

Within Korn Ferry Hay Group, enhancements to our PayNet database and the launch of the new Korn Ferry Assessment Platform will allow us to embed analytics directly into our clients user experience, providing actionable insights. 
 New OfferingsMore than 150,000 consumers have visited Korn Ferry Advance, our new business-to-consumer offering, since it launched in the United States (the U.S.) in July 2017. We are expanding and enhancing the offering to provide more focused assistance to people looking to make their next career move, as well as to provide tailored career services to an organizations people. Korn Ferry Advance will continue to leverage cutting-edge technology as well as the greatest asset we haveour consultants. 
 In addition, we launched Korn Ferry Direct, our Client Platform Services product tailored for small and mid-sized businesses, and Consent Manager, a new enterprise tool to help clients manage their increasing responsibility for employee and candidate data privacy. 
 Productivity EnhancementsWe will make further investments into our global SAP platform, which was put in service in the early 2000s and configured to support an executive search business. As we grow and evolve the Company to a solution and industry orientation, we will ensure that we have the proper infrastructure and technology to deliver the appropriate data and information to efficiently and effectively manage the enterprise. 
Extend the Korn Ferry Brand 
 Next to our people, the Korn Ferry brand is the strongest asset of the Company. 
 Positioning Korn Ferry as the preeminent global organizational consultancy and demonstrating our unique ability to drive business performance through people remains a key tenet of our global marketing program. Our objective is to improve awareness and perceptions of the evolved Korn Ferry across our key buyer segments (Board Directors, CEOs, Chief Human Resource Officers (CHRO) and the C-suite) and investor base. We are also extending our presence to a professional-level audience focused on advancing their careers. We have significantly enhanced our thought leadership and digital presence in support of these goals. 
 As we increasingly extend our brand, broaden our solutions and attract top talent to the firm, Korn Ferry is well positioned for the future. 
 Advance Korn Ferry as a Premier Career Destination 
 We continue to invest in building a world-class organization that is aligned to our strategy and is staffed by a capable, motivated and agile workforce. A few key initiatives in this area include: 

◾ | Career Paths and MobilityWe have architected and will implement the new Korn Ferry career model across the entire business to define career paths, as well as to encourage talent mobility and self-directed development.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | OnboardingOur workforce has nearly doubled since fiscal 2015 and must continue to grow to deliver on our growth. To support this, we are providing a standardized, global onboarding experience for all Korn Ferry new hires using a common platform, materials and resources to ensure all new hires are effectively integrated into the Company with reduced ramp-up time to full productivity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Korn Ferry AcademyOur growth plans require a learning, agile organization. In fiscal 2018, we launched a new learning management system (The Korn Ferry Academy) to serve as a Center of Excellence focused on the growth and development of our colleagues through rich, personalized content.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Succession and DevelopmentWe are working on aligning and building capabilities for our future needs. The process was initiated with the senior leadership team and we are now cascading it to additional levels of the Company, including emerging talent.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pursue Transformational Opportunities at the Intersection of Talent and Strategy 
 We have developed a core competency in identifying, acquiring and integrating M&A targets that have the potential to further our strategic objectives and enhance shareholder value. Our disciplined approach to M&A will continue to play a critical role in the ongoing evolution of Korn Ferry into an industry specialized, business outcomes oriented solutions provider at the intersection of talent and strategy. While we will continue to execute

on our targeted organic growth pathways, M&A will be a vital component of our future growth and capital deployment strategies. 
 Our Services and Organization 
 Organization 
 The Company operates through its three global business segments: Executive Search, Hay Group, and Futurestep. Our Executive Search business is managed on a geographic basis throughout four regions: North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific and Latin America. Hay Group and Futurestep are managed on a global basis with operations in North America, EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America. 
 We address our clients needs through our three business segments: 
 Executive Search 
 OverviewKorn Ferry Executive Search helps clients attract and hire leaders who fit with their organization and make it stand out. Our services are typically used to fill executive-level positions, such as board directors, chief executive officers, chief financial officers, chief operating officers, chief information officers, chief human resource officers and other senior executive officers. 
 As part of being retained by a client to conduct a search, we assemble a team of consultants with appropriate geographic, industry and functional expertise. We utilize a standardized and differentiated approach to placing talent that integrates our research-based IP with our practical experience. Our search consultants serve as management advisors who work closely with the client in identifying, assessing and placing qualified candidates. In fiscal 2018, we executed 6,325 new executive search assignments. 
 Industry SpecializationConsultants in our five global markets and regional specialty practice groups bring an in-depth understanding of the market conditions and strategic management issues faced by clients within their specific industries and geographies. We are continually looking to expand our specialized expertise through internal development and strategic hiring in targeted growth areas.

 Functional ExpertiseWe have organized executive search centers of functional expertise, composed of consultants who have extensive backgrounds in placing executives in certain functions, such as board directors, CEOs and other senior executive officers. Our Board & CEO Services group, for example, focuses exclusively on placing CEOs and board directors in organizations around the world. This is a dedicated team from the most senior ranks of the Company. Their work is with CEOs and in the boardroom, and their expertise is organizational leadership and governance. They conduct hundreds of engagements every year, tapping talent from every corner of the globe. This work spans all ranges of organizational scale and purpose. Members of functional groups are located throughout our regions and across our industry groups.

Regions 
 North AmericaAs of April 30, 2018, we had operations in 20 cities throughout the United States and Canada. In fiscal 2018, the region generated fee revenue of $408.1 million and opened 2,665 new engagements with an average of 248 consultants. 
 EMEAAs of April 30, 2018, we had operations in 24 cities in 19 countries throughout the region. In fiscal 2018, the region generated fee revenue of $173.7 million and opened 1,849 new engagements with an average of 154 consultants. 
 Asia PacificAs of April 30, 2018, we had operations in 18 cities in 10 countries throughout the region. In fiscal 2018, the region generated fee revenue of $96.6 million and opened 1,132 new engagements with an average of 95 consultants. 
 Latin AmericaAs of April 30, 2018, we had operations in 9 cities in 7 countries covering the entire Latin America region. In fiscal 2018, the region generated fee revenue of $30.6 million in fiscal 2018 and opened 679 new engagements with an average of 33 consultants. 
 Client BaseOur 3,773 Search engagement clients in fiscal 2018 include many of the worlds largest and most prestigious public and private companies. 
 CompetitionOther multinational executive search firms include Egon Zehnder, Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc., Russell Reynolds Associates and Spencer Stuart. Although these firms are our largest competitors in executive search, we also compete with smaller boutique firms that specialize in specific regional, industry or functional searches. We believe our brand name, differentiated business model, systematic approach to client service, cutting-edge technology, unique IP, global network, prestigious clientele, strong specialty practices and high-caliber colleagues are recognized worldwide. We also believe our long-term incentive compensation arrangements, as well as other executive benefits, distinguish us from most of our competitors and are important in attracting and retaining our key consultants. 
Hay Group 
 OverviewKorn Ferry Hay Group helps clients design their organizationthe structure, roles and responsibilitiesand shows them the best way to compensate, develop and motivate their people. Our focus is on making change happen and helping people and organizations realize their potential. 
 Korn Ferry Hay Group is known for creating and owning the most widely used job evaluation methodology in the world. We have helped clients assess, select and develop hundreds of thousands of managers and executives. In addition, we have built the richest and most comprehensive database of organizational management information in the world, enabling our clients to benchmark themselves against the best performers in their industries. 
 We deliver a combination of solutions consulting and product services that address how people work, and how to nurture them so that business strategies succeed.

KF Merger 
 As discussed above, in connection with the Plan, the Company intends to pursue a holding company reorganization (the KF Merger), after which a new public holding company, Korn Ferry, will own all of the stock of the Company. The Company will initially form Korn Ferry as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Then, pursuant to the KF Merger, the Company will merge with and into another newly formed entityMerger Sub, a Delaware corporation, and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Korn Ferry and indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Companywith the Company surviving as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Korn Ferry and operating under the legal name Korn Ferry US. Each share of Company stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the KF Merger will be converted into an equivalent corresponding share of Korn Ferry stock, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Company stock being converted. The Companys current stockholders will become stockholders of Korn Ferry upon the consummation of the KF Merger and will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the conversion of their shares.

The Company plans to conduct the KF Merger pursuant to Section 251(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), which permits the creation of a holding company through a merger with a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the constituent corporation without stockholder approval, to create a parent company holding structure. The Company will adopt an amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws upon the consummation of the KF Merger, which will also reflect the change of the name of the corporation to Korn Ferry US, as permitted by Section 251(g) of the DGCL. Following the consummation of the KF Merger and as part of the Plan, the Company intends to merge certain of its subsidiaries organized in the U.S. with and into Korn Ferry US.
