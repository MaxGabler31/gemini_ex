The net cash used in operating activities was mainly offset by the impairment loss on investment in associate company of $231,705 and decrease in trade receivables of $39,033. In addition, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company’s July 31, 2022 audited financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
 
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support from its major shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Company’s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company can obtain additional financing, if necessary, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.
