ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Revance is a commercial stage biotechnology company focused on innovative aesthetic and therapeutic offerings, including its next-generation, long-acting, neuromodulator product, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection combines a proprietary stabilizing peptide excipient with a highly purified botulinum toxin that does not contain human or animal-based components. We have successfully completed Phase 3 programs for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection across two different treatment categories, aesthetics and therapeutics. In the aesthetics category, we completed our Phase 3 program for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar (frown) lines and are pursuing United States (“U.S.”) regulatory approval. In the therapeutics category, we completed our Phase 3 program for the treatment of cervical dystonia in November 2021 and plan to pursue U.S. regulatory approval following the FDA approval of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for glabellar lines. We are also evaluating additional aesthetic and therapeutic indications for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection including the full upper face, which includes glabellar lines, forehead lines and crow’s feet, and adult upper limb spasticity. To complement DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, we own a unique portfolio of premium products and services for U.S. aesthetics practices, including the exclusive U.S. distribution rights to the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, the first and only range of FDA approved fillers for correction of dynamic facial wrinkles and folds, and OPUL™. We have also partnered with Viatris to develop an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, which would compete in the existing short-acting neuromodulator marketplace.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Operations
The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operational and financial performance will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including variant strains of the virus and the degree of their vaccine resistance and as a result of new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain or treat it, and the duration and intensity of the related effects. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to negatively affect global economic activity, the regulatory approval process for our product candidates, our supply chain, research and development activities, end user demand for our products and services and commercialization activities. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused delays in the regulatory approval process for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. In November 2020, the FDA deferred a decision on the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines. The FDA reiterated that an inspection of our manufacturing facility was required as part of the BLA approval process, but the FDA was unable to conduct the required inspection due to the FDA’s travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the inspection has been completed, in October 2021, we received a CRL due to deficiencies related to the FDA’s onsite inspection at our manufacturing facility. Resubmission of the BLA requires the remediation of the deficiencies identified by the FDA during the inspection, and a reinspection is required. We cannot be certain of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the regulatory approval process for the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines, including the timing of the FDA's reinspection of the manufacturing facility, or the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the timing of the regulatory approval process for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in indications outside of glabellar lines or on any supplemental BLAs we may file.
Our supply of and our ability to commercialize the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers has been impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The product supply of the Current RHA® Collection of dermal fillers was delayed by our distribution partner Teoxane as they temporarily suspended production in Geneva, Switzerland as a precaution in early 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Teoxane resumed manufacturing operations at the end of April 2020 and delivered the first shipment of the Current RHA® Collection of dermal fillers to us in June 2020. As a result, our initial product launch of the Current RHA® Collection of dermal fillers was delayed by one quarter to September 2020. We have taken steps to build sufficient levels of inventory to help mitigate potential future supply chain disruptions, but we cannot be certain of whether we will experience additional delays in the future. In addition, port closures and other restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to disrupt our supply chain or limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for the production of our products and the sale of our services. The global chip shortage is currently impacting our third-party partners’ ability to provide us with the point of sale (“POS”) hardware terminals that are provided to customers as a part of the OPUL™ service offering. If our third-party partner cannot provide enough POS terminals to meet OPULTM demand or we are unable to provide a substitute device, we may be unable to timely board new customers or fulfill orders for additional 
Table of Contents

hardware from existing customers. If the shortage continues for an extended period of time, it could materially and adversely affect the Fintech Platform’s business.
Our clinical trials have been and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has and may further delay enrollment in and the progress of our current and future clinical trials. Even as some restrictions have been lifted and vaccines are widely available in the United States and certain other countries, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to result in government imposed quarantines and consume hospital resources, especially if infection rates rise or more contagious variants develop and spread. Patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, enrollment in the JUNIPER Phase 2 adult upper limb spasticity trial was paused in March 2020 due to challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial was originally designed to include 128 subjects. Due to COVID-19 challenges related to continued subject enrollment and the scheduling of in-person study visits, in June 2020, we announced the decision to end screening and complete the JUNIPER trial with the 83 patients enrolled at that time.
To ensure proper clinical trial coordination and completion, in line with the FDA-issued guidance on March 18, 2020 on the Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have evaluated and implemented risk-based approaches for remote clinical trial monitoring and activities, including remote patient assessment, for those subjects who cannot physically visit clinic sites, to ensure the full completion of trials. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause general business disruption worldwide. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we curtailed employee travel and implemented a corporate work-from-home policy in March 2020. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, certain manufacturing, quality and laboratory-based employees continued to work onsite, and certain employees with customer-facing roles have been onsite for training and interfacing in-person with customers in connection with the product launch of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers. We have resumed essential on-site corporate operations and have begun to transition employees back on-site in accordance with local and regional restrictions. Although many of our employees have returned to working on-site, if the severity, duration or nature of the COVID-19 pandemic changes, it may have an impact on our ability to continue on-site operations, which could disrupt our manufacturing operations, clinical trials, sales activities and other operations. See “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors—The current COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to, and other actual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or public health crises may, adversely affect our financial condition and our business.”
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, end user demand for our products and services, commercialization efforts, business operations, clinical trials and other aspects of our business, the healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. As such, it is uncertain as to the full magnitude that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 
Key 2021 Developments
Regulatory Update on DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Glabellar Lines
On October 15, 2021, we received a CRL with respect to the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines. The FDA determined it was unable to approve the BLA in its present form due to deficiencies related to the onsite inspection at our manufacturing facility. The CRL did not identify any other deficiencies. In December 2021, we held a Type A meeting with the FDA to gain clarity and alignment on the requirements for approval of the BLA. Based on the meeting minutes, which we received on January 14, 2022, a complete response to address the outstanding observations related to the working cell bank (“WCB”) and the drug substance manufacturing process will require us to qualify the new WCB by producing three consecutive drug substance lots and one drug product lot. We have completed the manufacturing of three consecutive drug substance lots and one drug product lot as part of the qualification of the new WCB and are actively working on completing the resubmission package for the BLA. A reinspection of our manufacturing facility will be required once the resubmission is accepted by the FDA.
RHA® Collection of Dermal Fillers
Table of Contents

In January 2020, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement (the “Teoxane Agreement”) with Teoxane, as amended in September 2020, pursuant to which Teoxane granted us the exclusive right to import, market, promote, sell and distribute Teoxane’s line of Resilient Hyaluronic Acid® dermal fillers, which include: (i) RHA® 2, RHA® 3 and RHA® 4, which have been approved by the FDA for the correction of moderate to severe dynamic facial wrinkles and folds (the “Current RHA® Collection”) and RHA® Redensity, which has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe dynamic perioral rhytids (lip lines) (collectively, the “RHA® Collection of dermal fillers”), and (ii) future hyaluronic acid filler advancements and products by Teoxane (the “RHA® Pipeline Products”) in the U.S. and U.S. territories and possessions, in exchange for 2,500,000 shares of our common stock and certain other commitments by us. 
We launched the Current RHA® Collection in the U.S. in September 2020. We plan to launch RHA® Redensity in the second half of 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the first full year of commercialization, we recognized $70.8 million in product revenue and $23.1 million in cost of product revenue (exclusive of amortization) from the sale of the Current RHA® Collection of dermal fillers.
OPULTM Relational Commerce Platform Launch 
On July 23, 2020, we completed the acquisition of HintMD (the “HintMD Acquisition”). Upon the close of the HintMD Acquisition, all HintMD operations began being conducted by Revance employees. Following the HintMD Acquisition, we began to operate in two reportable segments: (1) our Product Segment, which refers to the business that includes the research, development and commercialization of our product candidates and the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, and (2) our Service Segment, which refers to the business that includes the development and commercialization of OPULTM, the next-generation fintech platform, and the HintMD platform, the legacy fintech platform. For additional information about our business segments, see Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules—Notes to consolidated financial statements—Note 16—Segment Information.”
On October 11, 2021, we launched OPULTM, a Relational Commerce Platform that combines seamless, simple and smart payment solutions, 360-degree practice reporting and insights, and enhanced customer support to foster increased consumer loyalty and retention, specifically designed for aesthetic practices in the U.S. 
OPULTM enables medical aesthetic practices (the “practices”) to improve practice management and economics and foster loyalty with customers, which supports the value chain of our aesthetics portfolio and aligns with our goal to improve outcomes for patients and practices. OPULTM will replace the HintMD platform, which will continue to be offered to existing HintMD customers with a phased migration to OPULTM.
OPULTM is a fully integrated payment facilitator (“PayFac”) pursuant to the Payment Facilitator Agreement (as defined below) with a third-party acquirer and sponsor bank. OPULTM enables practices to process payments for their patients and provides practice management solutions that support practices’ operations. Since OPULTM generates revenue as a percentage of credit card processing volumes, we use GPV as a key indicator of the ability of OPULTM to generate revenue. GPV measures the total dollar amount of all transactions processed in the period through the Fintech Platform, net of refunds. The Company also uses the Fintech Platform PayFac capabilities to process credit card transactions for products purchased from the Company; these transactions are not included in GPV. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Fintech Platform processed $506 million of GPV.
ASPEN-OLS Results
In November 2021, we announced positive topline results from the ASPEN-OLS Phase 3 study of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of adults with cervical dystonia. In all dose groups, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection appeared to be generally safe and well tolerated. The most common treatment-related adverse events were muscular weakness (4.9% of treatments administered), dysphagia (4.2% of treatments administered) and injection site pain (2.7% of treatments administered). There were no serious treatment-related adverse events or dose-dependent increases in adverse events observed. The median duration of effect, defined by the time to reach the Target Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) Score, ranged from 19.9 weeks to 26.0 weeks across doses within the evaluable treatment cycles. For additional information, See “—Product Candidates—DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Therapeutic Indications.”

Preservation of Capital and Expense Management
Beginning in October 2021, we took measures to defer or reduce costs in the near term in order to preserve capital and increase financial flexibility as a result of the delay in the potential approval of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines. These measures include but are not limited to: pausing non-critical hires; deferring the Phase 3 clinical program for upper limb spasticity and other therapeutics pipeline activities; and deferring international regulatory and commercial investment for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, with the exception of supporting our partnership with Fosun. These cash preservation measures may impact our ability and the timing to execute our strategy discussed below in “—Our Strategy.”
The commercial launch delay and its impact on our capital resources has raised substantial doubt with respect to our ability to meet our obligations to continue as a going concern. Our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will not allow us to fund our operations for at least 12 months following the filing of this Report. In order to mitigate the substantial doubt to continue as a going concern, we will be required to raise additional capital to fund our operations. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we will be required to take additional actions beyond the cost preservation measures previously initiated to address our liquidity needs, including to continue to further reduce operating expense and delay, reduce the scope of, discontinue or alter our research and development activities for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA® Pipeline Products and our onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar program; the development of OPUL™; our sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to continue to commercialize the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, OPUL™ and our product candidates, if approved, and other aspects of our business plan. See Part II, Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Our Strategy
Our objective is to be a leading provider of botulinum toxin products across multiple aesthetic and therapeutic indications and to expand the opportunity for botulinum toxin products and other innovative and complimentary products and services, including hyaluronic acid dermal fillers and OPUL™. 
Key elements of our strategy are:
•We plan to leverage DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection’s unique formulation and duration profile to build valuable franchises in aesthetics and therapeutics, which includes commercializing complimentary products like the RHA® Pipeline Products and OPUL™. We believe DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection has the ability to expand the neuromodulator opportunity by appealing to patients who seek a long-lasting effect. 
•We have and will continue to selectively evaluate partnerships, distribution opportunities, joint development agreements and acquisitions as a way to expand our aesthetic and therapeutic franchises while enhancing our competitive position. Our partnership with Teoxane enabled us to enter the dermal filler market in the U.S. and provides us with an opportunity to set a foundation for the commercialization of future aesthetic products. We have the potential to enter the second largest neuromodulator market with strategic partnerships like the license agreement (the “Fosun License Agreement”) with Fosun, whereby we have granted Fosun the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau (the “Fosun Territory”). Further, we have entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Viatris (the “Viatris Collaboration”), pursuant to which we are collaborating with Viatris exclusively, on a world-wide basis (excluding Japan), to develop, manufacture and commercialize an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, which provides us with the potential to participate in the short-acting neuromodulator opportunity.
•We will use results from three clinical trials in therapeutic indications – cervical dystonia, which was released in October 2020 and November 2021, upper limb spasticity, which was released in February 2021, and plantar fasciitis, which was released in November 2020, to inform our regulatory pathway and commercial strategy in the therapeutics market.

•We aim to transform the practice and patient experience in the aesthetics market through OPUL™. OPUL™ aims to improve practice management, assist with the creation of revenue opportunities and increase patient retention for practices. 
The Botulinum Toxin Opportunity
Botulinum toxin is a protein and neurotoxin produced by clostridium botulinum. Since 1989, botulinum toxin has been used to treat a variety of aesthetic and therapeutic indications in the U.S. and globally. Botulinum toxin blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor or sympathetic nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. This inhibition occurs as the neurotoxin cleaves SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within nerve endings. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, botulinum toxin produces partial chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in a localized reduction in muscle activity. Throughout this Report, we use neuromodulators to refer to botulinum toxins and neurotoxins.
According to the Decision Resources Group ("DRG"), the global market opportunity for neuromodulators was estimated to be $5.4 billion in 2021 compared to $4.5 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach approximately $8.7 billion by 2026, registering a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 9.9% from 2021 to 2026. DRG estimates that the market opportunity for aesthetic indications and therapeutic indications in 2021 is approximately 49% and 51%, respectively. We expect continued growth to be driven by demographics, changing lifestyle, new indications and product launches in new geographies. 
For information on competition we face in these markets, please see "—Product Competition" below.
The Opportunity for Neuromodulators for Aesthetic Indications
Injectable neuromodulator treatments are the single largest cosmetic procedure in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., neuromodulators have been approved to treat three aesthetic indications, glabellar lines, forehead lines and lateral canthal lines. According to DRG, neuromodulator aesthetic injections continued to be the most frequently performed aesthetic injectable procedure in the U.S. in 2021, with 7.8 million procedures performed, which represents an increase of 24% over 2020. Also, according to DRG, the global aesthetic neuromodulator market opportunity was estimated to be $2.7 billion in 2021 compared to $2.2 billion in 2020. The global aesthetic neuromodulator market is projected to reach approximately $4.6 billion by 2026, registering a five-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11.5% from 2021 to 2026. 
We believe that we are positioned to take advantage of this growing market opportunity due to the duration profile of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. In our SAKURA Phase 3 clinical program for the treatment of glabellar lines, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection demonstrated a median time to the loss of none or mild wrinkle severity of 24 weeks (6 months) and a median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity of approximately 28 weeks (7 months). According to the prescribing information from other neuromodulators on the market, duration of effect is three to four months.
According to our 2018 Harris Poll survey results, 86% of the physicians surveyed wanted a neuromodulator that offered longer-lasting results than what was available, and 88% of the patients considered long lasting duration very important or absolutely essential. In addition, our primary qualitative market research among aesthetic physicians, patients, and office practice managers indicated that longer duration than what is currently available on the market is a differentiating and desirable attribute. Quantitative market research also shows most consumers visit their physicians less than twice per year for treatments. 
We believe that a product which shows persistence of effect over time, with a slow return to baseline and a meaningful consumer benefit of up to six months, would be a desirable treatment regimen for physicians and patients and would align with existing customer habits. A product with a longer duration would enable patients to remain more satisfied between treatments.

The Opportunity for Neuromodulators for Therapeutic Indications
In the U.S., neuromodulators have been approved for the treatment of cervical dystonia, upper limb spasticity (adult and pediatric), chronic migraine headache, lower limb spasticity, urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, blepharospasm, strabismus, hyperhidrosis and neurogenic detrusor overactivity (adult and pediatric). In addition, neuromodulator products are being evaluated in clinical trials for other therapeutic indications, including acne, rosacea, skin and wound healing, scar reduction, hair loss treatments, and several musculoskeletal and neurological conditions.
We are currently pursuing the development and commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity because we believe there is opportunity to improve injectable neuromodulator use in muscle movement disorders. Muscle movement disorders are neurological conditions that affect a person’s ability to control muscle activity in one or more areas of the body. Cervical dystonia is a painful and disabling chronic condition in which the neck muscles contract involuntarily, causing abnormal movements and awkward posture of the head and neck. Cervical dystonia affects approximately 60,000 people in the U.S. According to DRG, the global market opportunity for cervical dystonia in 2021 was $436 million and is expected to grow to $624 million by 2026, registering a five-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 7.5% from 2021 to 2026. 
Muscle spasticity happens after the body’s nervous system has been damaged, most commonly by a stroke, trauma or disease. Muscle spasticity can be painful and may have a significant effect on a person’s quality of life. Certain tasks, like getting dressed or bathing, become difficult, and a person’s self-esteem may be affected by an abnormal posture. Spasticity affects approximately 500,000 people in the U.S. and approximately 12 million people globally. According to DRG, the global spasticity market in 2021 was approximately $791 million and is expected to grow to $1.2 billion by 2026. 
Although currently FDA approved neuromodulators have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of muscle movement disorders, such neuromodulator injections must be repeated every three to four months. We believe there is a significant need for a longer-lasting injectable neuromodulator, which has the potential to offer patients more value by not only reducing the frequency of visits, but also allowing them to achieve longer symptom relief between injection cycles. We believe that DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection has the potential to provide these benefits if approved. In 2021, we completed the ASPEN Phase 3 clinical program for the treatment of cervical dystonia, and we completed the JUNIPER Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of upper limb spasticity and plan to advance to a Phase 3 program. In the ASPEN-1 Phase 3 clinical trial, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection demonstrated a median duration of effect of 24.0 weeks in one treatment group and 20.3 weeks in another treatment group. In the JUNIPER Phase 2 clinical trial, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection demonstrated a median duration of at least 24 weeks across all three doses. See “—Our Product Candidates— DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection—DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Therapeutic Indications.”
The Hyaluronic Acid Dermal Filler Opportunity 
Dermal fillers are injected into the superficial and deep layers of the skin to restore volume, smooth lines, provide facial lift and contour, plump the lips or improve the appearance of facial scars commonly caused by acne. Hyaluronic acid dermal fillers represent 90% of the total U.S. dermal filler market, and according to DRG, hyaluronic acid dermal fillers were the second most common aesthetic injectable procedure in 2021. Hyaluronic acid is naturally found in the body, primarily in the skin, joints and connective tissue. With age, human skin loses its ability to produce hyaluronic acid, resulting in the loss of volume, firmness and elasticity. Hyaluronic acid dermal fillers are manufactured from synthesized hyaluronic acid cross-linked to significantly enhance durability in the skin. These products can restore lost volume for six to 12 months or longer before the body gradually and naturally absorbs the hyaluronic acid. Most hyaluronic acid dermal fillers also contain lidocaine to help minimize discomfort during and after treatment. 
In 2021, DRG estimated that 2.3 million hyaluronic acid dermal filler procedures were performed in the U.S. According to DRG, the U.S. market opportunity for hyaluronic acid dermal fillers was estimated to be $1.1 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach approximately $2.1 billion by 2026, registering a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 14.2% from 2021 to 2026.
Access to the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers not only provides us with the capability to compete in the U.S. dermal filler market, but also provides a foundation from which to launch DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved, 
Table of Contents

and other potential aesthetic product offerings. We believe hyaluronic acid dermal fillers have the potential to complement our premium aesthetics offering and strengthen the commercial acceptance and use of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved. We believe our ability to offer a comprehensive aesthetics portfolio, including the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved, positions us to compete with established competitors that leverage a portfolio of aesthetic products. 
For information on competition we face in this market, please see “—Product Competition” below.
The Aesthetic Practice Fintech Opportunity 
OPULTM provides a seamless, simple and smart payment solution, practice reporting and insights, and enhanced customer support that enables practices to improve practice management and economics and foster loyalty with customers, which completes the value chain of our aesthetics portfolio and aligns with our goal to improve outcomes for patients and practices. We believe that OPULTM will enable us to grow our U.S. aesthetics market opportunity and give us access to the aesthetic practice payment processing market and recurring aesthetic practice treatment and services revenue.
In 2019, the U.S. aesthetic practice payment services market was estimated to generate more than $500 million in revenue based on a growing base of 40,000 aesthetic practices processing an estimated $68 billion. On average, credit card processors charge 2.9% to 4.4% per transaction to complete a financial transaction depending on a variety of factors such as the type of credit card, whether the card is physically present and other variables and receive a margin of 0.5% to 1% per transaction. With the expected growth of the aesthetic market, the revenue for the U.S. aesthetic practice fintech market is expected to grow to approximately $500 million by 2025.

Our Product Candidates    
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection
Our lead product candidate, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, combines a proprietary stabilizing peptide excipient with a highly purified botulinum toxin that does not contain human or animal-based components. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection has demonstrated high response rates and long duration of effect. 
The DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection formulation incorporates our proprietary stabilizing peptide excipient along with the other excipients: polysorbate-20, buffers and a sugar. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection will be supplied as a lyophilized powder which will require reconstitution with saline prior to injection. The highly positively charged peptide excipient has been shown to bind non-covalently to the daxibotulinumtoxinA molecule. The unique formulation of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection has permitted us to create a drug product without human serum albumin, found in all other FDA approved neuromodulator products. Clinical trial results demonstrate that DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection may provide long duration of effect at the target muscle with a safety profile consistent with currently approved neuromodulator products. We are currently focusing on developing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of both aesthetic and therapeutic indications.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Aesthetic Indications
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Glabellar Lines
Glabellar Lines, often called “frown lines,” are vertical lines that develop between the eyebrows and may appear as a single vertical line or as two or more lines. When one frowns, the muscles of the glabella contract causing vertical creases to form between the eyebrows. Neuromodulators are used to temporarily block the ability of nerves to trigger contraction of the injected muscle, inhibiting movement of the muscles that cause the frown lines, giving the skin a smoother, more refreshed appearance. Current treatments include neuromodulator injections, dermal fillers, laser treatments and topical creams.
Clinical Trials. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection was studied in two early clinical trials in glabellar lines that established the dose that was taken forward into the Phase 3 program. The Phase 3 clinical program for glabellar lines included three studies: two 36-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single administration of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults (SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2), and an 84-week, open-label safety trial designed to evaluate the long-term safety of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults following both single and repeat treatment administration (SAKURA 3). 
Following our announcement of the top-line results for the SAKURA 3 trial, we submitted the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines in November 2019, which was accepted by the FDA on February 5, 2020, and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) target action date was initially set for November 25, 2020. On November 24, 2020, the FDA deferred its decision on the BLA. The FDA reiterated that an inspection of our manufacturing facility is required as part of the BLA approval process, but the FDA was unable to conduct the required inspection of our manufacturing facility in Newark, California due to the FDA’s travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA initiated the pre-approval inspection of our manufacturing facility in June 2021. Following the inspection, the FDA provided us with its observations in a Form 483, and we responded to those observations in July 2021.
On October 15, 2021, we received a CRL with respect to the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines. The FDA determined it was unable to approve the BLA in its present form due to deficiencies related to the onsite inspection at our manufacturing facility. The CRL did not identify any other deficiencies. In December 2021, we held a Type A meeting with the FDA to gain clarity and alignment on the requirements for approval of the BLA. Based on the meeting minutes, received by the Company on January 14, 2022, a complete response to address the outstanding observations related to the WCB and the drug substance manufacturing process will require the Company to qualify its new WCB by producing three consecutive drug substance lots and one drug product lot. We have completed the manufacturing of three consecutive drug substance lots and one drug product lot as part of the qualification of the new WCB and are actively

working on completing the resubmission package for the BLA. A reinspection of the Company’s manufacturing facility will be required once the resubmission is accepted by the FDA.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Upper Facial Lines
Upper facial lines (“UFL”) is the name commonly given to the combination of the three most commonly treated facial areas with neuromodulators; specifically, glabellar lines, lateral canthal lines and forehead lines. In clinical practice, a large proportion of patients seek treatment in all three areas to address signs of aging.
In December 2019, we initiated a new multicenter, open-label Phase 2 trial for the treatment of the UFL (the “UFL Trial”) to understand the safety and efficacy, including potential dosing and injection patterns, of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, covering the UFL. Interim Week 4 data from the Phase 2a studies in forehead lines and lateral canthal lines, which are discussed below, were used in the final design of the UFL Trial to optimize dosing and injection patterns. We released topline results from the UFL Trial in December of 2020. In the UFL Trial, 48 subjects were enrolled to receive a single treatment of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection with a total study duration of 36 weeks. Subjects concurrently received 40, 32, and 48 units of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection respectively in the glabellar complex, forehead and lateral canthal areas. The key endpoints for efficacy were the proportion of subjects achieving a score of none or mild wrinkle severity at maximum contraction (maximum frown, eyebrow elevation, and smile effort) at Week 4, as assessed on the Investigator Global Assessment Frown Wrinkle Severity, Investigator Global Assessment Forehead Wrinkle Severity, and Investigator Global Assessment Lateral Canthal Wrinkle Severity, respectively. The proportion of subjects achieving a score of none or mild at Week 4 were 95.8%, 95.8% and 91.7% for glabellar lines, forehead lines and lateral canthal lines, respectively. The UFL Trial measured duration of effect in responders (those who achieved a score of none or mild at Week 4). These duration measures were defined as the median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity or the time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity, both based on investigator and subject assessments. The median time to return to base line was 33.3, 35.3 and 35.2 weeks, and the median time to loss of none or mild was 25.0, 24.0 and 28.1 weeks for glabellar lines, forehead lines and lateral canthal lines, respectively. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection was generally well tolerated, and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events. The most common adverse events were injection site erythema (6.3%), facial discomfort (4.2%) and headache (2.1%). No eyelid or brow ptosis was reported.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Forehead Lines
Forehead lines are produced by the action of the frontalis muscle, a large, thin, vertically-oriented muscle which lifts the eyebrows. The frontalis muscle serves as an antagonist to the glabellar musculature, a natural depressor that is responsible for frowning and associated eyebrow movement. As the eyebrow is considered the aesthetic center of the upper face, forehead lines can significantly impact the aesthetic appearance of the face, contribute to increased signs of aging and convey unwanted social signals. Current treatments include neuromodulator injections, dermal fillers, laser treatments and topical creams.
In January 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the treatment of moderate or severe dynamic forehead lines in conjunction with treatment of the glabellar complex (the "Forehead Lines Trial"). The objective was to understand the potential dosing and injection patterns of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in other areas of the upper face in addition to the lead indication in glabellar lines. We released top-line results from the Forehead Lines Trial in June 2020. The primary endpoint for efficacy was the proportion of subjects achieving a score of none or mild in wrinkle or line severity at Week 4 at maximum eyebrow elevation for forehead lines. In the Forehead Lines Trial, 100% of subjects achieved a score of none or mild at Week 4 in at least one treatment group. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection was well-tolerated at all dose levels. Adverse events were mild, localized and transient, and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events, as is common with other approved neuromodulators in the treatment of upper facial lines. One of the exploratory endpoints in the Forehead Lines Trial was duration of effect, defined as the median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity based on both investigator and patient assessment. At least one dose in the study demonstrated a median duration of effect of 27 weeks on forehead lines. Interim data from the Forehead Lines Trial was used in the final design of the UFL Trial to optimize dosing and injection patterns, which is discussed above in "DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Upper Facial Lines.”

DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Lateral Canthal Lines
Lateral canthal lines (“LCL” or “crow’s feet”) are the spider-like fine lines around the outside corners of the eyes that become more obvious when someone smiles. These lines (also referred to as periorbital wrinkles, laugh lines or smile lines), fan out across the skin from the outer corner of each eye. Repetitive motions, such as squinting and smiling, can lead to the increase of wrinkles and contribute to the severity and onset of crow’s feet. Age and exposure to sun also play significant roles in development of these lines, which can deepen over time. Current treatments include eye creams and moisturizers, topical tretinoins, neuromodulator injections, dermal fillers and laser treatments. 
In March 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the treatment of moderate or severe lateral canthal lines (the “LCL Tria”). The objective was to understand the potential dosing of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the lateral canthal area. We released top-line results from the LCL Trial in June 2020. The primary endpoint for efficacy was the proportion of subjects achieving a score of none or mild in wrinkle or line severity at Week 4 at maximum smile for crow’s feet. In the LCL Trial, 88% of subjects achieved a score of none or mild at Week 4 in at least one treatment group. DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection was well-tolerated at all dose levels. Adverse events were mild, localized and transient as expected and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events, as is common with other approved neuromodulators in the treatment of upper facial lines. One of the exploratory endpoints in the LCL Trial was duration of effect, defined as the median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity based on both investigator and patient assessment. At least one dose in the study demonstrated a median duration of effect of 24 weeks on crow’s feet. Interim data from the LCL Trial was used in the final design of the UFL Trial to optimize dosing and injection patterns, which is discussed above in Part I, Item 1. “Business—DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Upper Facial Lines.”
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Therapeutic Indications
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection is currently being developed for the treatment of cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity. We will continue to evaluate development for other therapeutic indications, such as migraine and neurological movement and other disorders, based on the results of our current preclinical studies and clinical trials.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Cervical Dystonia
Cervical dystonia is a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions of the head, neck, and shoulders, resulting in pain, abnormal movements and/or postural changes. While not life-threatening, cervical dystonia can be painful and may have a significant effect on a person’s quality of life. The cause of cervical dystonia is often unknown, and treatment with a neuromodulator is the current standard of care.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of moderate to severe cervical dystonia was studied in a Phase 2 dose-escalating study and was advanced into a Phase 3 program. In 2018, we initiated the ASPEN-1 Phase 3 clinical trial program for the treatment of cervical dystonia, which was a 301-subject, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing two doses of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (125 units and 250 units) to placebo and conducted at 60 sites across the U.S., Canada and Europe. Subjects were randomized 3:3:1 to receive a single treatment of either 125 units or 250 units of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or placebo and were followed for up to 36 weeks. In October 2020, we announced positive topline results from the ASPEN-1 trial. The drug appeared to be well-tolerated at both doses. The study met its primary efficacy endpoint at both doses, demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in the signs and symptoms of cervical dystonia at the average of Weeks 4 and 6. Compared to placebo, subjects treated with either 125 Units or 250 Units showed a statistically significant greater change from baseline as measured by the TWSTRS score. Median duration of effect was 24.0 and 20.3 weeks, for the 125 Unit and 250 Unit dose groups respectively, based on the median time to loss of 80% of the peak treatment effect. There were no serious treatment-related adverse events and no dose-dependent increase in adverse events was observed. Treatment-related adverse events were generally transient and mild to moderate in severity, with one case of neck pain reported as severe, which resolved two days after onset. The three most common treatment-related adverse events were (for 125 Units and 250 Units, respectively): injection site pain (7.9%, 4.7%), headache (4.7%, 4.7%), and injection site erythema (4.7%, 2.3%). The incidence of dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and muscle weakness, which are considered adverse events of particular interest with neuromodulator treatments for cervical dystonia, was (for 125 units and 250 units, respectively): dysphagia (1.6%, 3.9%) and muscular weakness (4.7%, 2.3%).

In November 2021, we announced positive topline results from the ASPEN-OLS Phase 3 study of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of cervical dystonia. ASPEN-OLS is a Phase 3, open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of repeat treatments of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in adults with cervical dystonia. Subjects could receive up to four treatments over a 52-week period. Doses evaluated included 125, 200, 250 and 300 units. The study enrolled a total of 357 subjects at 64 sites in the U.S., Canada and Europe.
In all dose groups, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection appeared to be generally safe and well tolerated. The most common treatment-related adverse events were muscular weakness (4.9% of treatments administered), dysphagia (4.2% of treatments administered) and injection site pain (2.7% of treatments administered). There were no serious treatment-related adverse events or dose-dependent increases in adverse events observed. The median duration of effect, defined by the time to reach the TWSTRS Score, ranged from 19.9 weeks to 26.0 weeks across doses within the evaluable treatment cycles.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for cervical dystonia is expected to be our first therapeutic indication of which we are aiming for regulatory approval.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Adult Upper Limb Spasticity
Spasticity is a motor symptom characterized by rigidity, muscle tightness, joint stiffness, involuntary jerky movements, exaggeration of reflexes, unusual posture, abnormal positioning and muscle spasms and can affect the hands, fingers, wrists, arms, elbows or shoulders. Muscle spasticity happens after the body’s nervous system has been damaged, most commonly by a stroke or brain injury. While not life-threatening, spasticity can be painful and may have a significant effect on a person’s quality of life. Neuromodulators are one of several approved therapies for the treatment of adult upper limb spasticity. Other treatments include oral and intrathecal muscle relaxants, physical therapy, splints, casts & braces, electrical stimulation, and surgery.
In December 2018, we initiated the JUNIPER Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for adults with moderate to severe upper limb spasticity due to stroke or traumatic brain injury. In February 2021, we announced topline data from the JUNIPER Phase 2 trial. Subjects were assigned to one of three doses of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (250 units, 375 units, or 500 units) or to placebo. The trial was originally designed to enroll 128 subjects. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 challenges related to continued subject enrollment and the scheduling of in-person study visits, we made the decision in June 2020 to complete study enrollment at 83 subjects.
The study’s co-primary endpoints were improvement from baseline in the Modified Ashworth Score (“MAS”) and the Physician Global Impression of Change (“PGIC”) score at Week 6. One co-primary endpoint was achieved in the 500-unit treatment group, which evaluated the change in the MAS score from baseline, with demonstration of a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction from baseline in muscle tone versus placebo (p=0.0488). Proof of concept was demonstrated with all three doses being numerically higher than placebo for the improvement in the MAS score. Statistical significance was not achieved on the second co-primary endpoint, however numerical improvement compared with placebo in all three doses on the PGIC assessment was achieved. 
The study was designed to run for up to 36 weeks, with the co-primary measures: mean change from baseline in muscle tone measured with the MAS in the suprahypertonic muscle group ("SMG" - the highest degree for muscle tone) of the elbow, wrist, or finger flexors at Week 6; and mean score of the PGIC at Week 6. The first 73 subjects, who were dosed before enrollment was paused in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were followed for up to 36 weeks, and the succeeding 10 subjects were followed up to Week 12.
On a key secondary endpoint, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection delivered a median duration of at least 24 weeks across all three doses. Duration of effect was defined as the time from injection (in weeks) until the loss of improvement as measured by the MAS (for the SMG) and the PGIC, or a request for retreatment by the subject. 
All three doses of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection were generally safe and well tolerated with no increase in the incidence of adverse events observed in the higher dose treatment groups. The majority of treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate in severity.

The JUNIPER Phase 2 trial generated sufficient data for progression to a Phase 3 study and to inform our dosing strategy and design for our Phase 3 program. In October 2021, we concluded our end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, which informed the study design for our JUNIPER Phase 3 program in upper limb spasticity. 
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Migraine
Migraine headache is a central nervous system disorder characterized as moderate to severe headache and often includes other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Migraine headache affects more than 39 million people in the U.S., of which more than 3 million of whom suffer from chronic migraine headache. Chronic migraine headache is both undertreated and underdiagnosed and is defined as more than fifteen headache days per month over a three-month period of which more than eight are migrainous, in the absence of medication overuse. 
We continue to evaluate the timing of the initiation of migraine clinical trials.
Topical
We are evaluating preclinically a topical program for indications currently served by neuromodulator treatments. A topical product presents several potential advantages, including painless topical administration, no bruising, ease of use and limited dependence on administration technique by physicians and medical staff. We believe these potential advantages may improve the experience of patients undergoing neuromodulator procedures and could make a topical product candidate suitable for multiple indications in the future. We may conduct additional preclinical work for a topical product candidate in therapeutic and aesthetic applications where neuromodulators have shown efficacy and are particularly well suited for injection-free treatments. 
Our Strategic Collaborations
The RHA® Pipeline Products
In January 2020, we entered into the Teoxane Agreement, pursuant to which Teoxane granted us the exclusive right to import, market, promote, sell and distribute the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and the RHA® Pipeline Products in the U.S. and U.S. territories and possessions, in exchange for 2,500,000 shares of our common stock and certain other commitments by us. In September 2020, we launched the Current RHA® Collection of dermal fillers. 
The RHA® Collection of dermal fillers is the first and only FDA-approved dermal fillers for the correction of dynamic facial wrinkles and folds, and it represents the latest advancements in hyaluronic acid filler technology. The dermal filler range is created using a novel and gentle manufacturing process called preserved network technology ("PNT") that has few chemical modifications. The PNT process helps preserve the natural structure of the hyaluronic acid, allowing it to more closely mimic the natural hyaluronic acid found in the skin. The result is a hyaluronic acid dermal filler that is easy to inject and gives patients a natural look.
The Teoxane Agreement is effective for a term of ten years from product launch and may be extended for a two-year period upon the mutual agreement of the parties. In September 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Teoxane Agreement to memorialize a revised launch date from April to September as a result of delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement, we are required to meet certain minimum purchase obligations and certain minimum expenditure requirements, which are discussed in Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules—Notes to consolidated financial statements— Note 15—Commitments and Contingencies.” If Teoxane pursues regulatory approval for certain new indications or filler technologies, including innovations with respect to existing products in the U.S., we will be subject to certain specified cost-sharing arrangements for third party expenses incurred in achieving regulatory approval for such products. We also have a right of first negotiation with respect to any cosmeceutical products that Teoxane wishes to distribute in the U.S, and Teoxane will have a right of first negotiation in connection with the distribution of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for aesthetic use outside the U.S. and U.S. territories where Teoxane has an affiliate.

OnabotulinumtoxinA Biosimilar
We entered into the Viatris Collaboration in February 2018, under which Revance and Viatris are collaborating exclusively, on a worldwide basis (excluding Japan), to develop, manufacture, and commercialize a biosimilar to the branded biologic product (onabotulinumtoxinA) marketed as BOTOX®. In February 2019, we had a biosimilar initial advisory meeting (“BIAM”) with the FDA and Viatris on a proposed onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar product candidate. Based on the FDA’s feedback, Revance and Viatris believe that a 351(k) pathway for the development of an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar is viable. 
In August 2019, we entered into an amendment to the Viatris Collaboration (the “Viatris Amendment”) which, among other things, extended the period of time for Viatris to make a decision under the Viatris Collaboration (the “Continuation Decision”) as to whether to continue the biosimilar development program beyond the initial development plan and the BIAM. In accordance with the Viatris Amendment, Viatris was required to notify us of the Continuation Decision on or before the later of (i) April 30, 2020 or (ii) 30 calendar days from the date that we provide Viatris with certain deliverables. Pursuant to the Viatris Amendment, Viatris agreed to pay us an additional $5.0 million above the previously agreed non-refundable upfront payment of $25.0 million with contingent payments of up to $100.0 million, in the aggregate, upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones, tiered sales milestones of up to $225.0 million, and royalties on sales of the biosimilar in the Viatris territories previously disclosed from the Viatris Collaboration. In June 2020, we announced that Viatris provided us its written notice of its Continuation Decision and paid us a $30 million milestone payment in connection with the Continuation Decision. We began the continuation phase of the onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar program and are moving forward with characterization and product development work, followed by an anticipated filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) with the FDA in 2022. Viatris has paid us an aggregate of $60 million in non-refundable fees as of December 31, 2021.
Fosun License Agreement
In December 2018, we entered into the Fosun License Agreement with Fosun, whereby we granted Fosun the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the Fosun Territory and certain sublicense rights. Fosun has paid us non-refundable upfront and other payments totaling $31.0 million before foreign withholding taxes as of December 31, 2021. We are also eligible to receive (i) additional remaining contingent payments of up to $229.5 million upon the achievement of certain milestones based on (a) the approval of BLAs for certain aesthetic and therapeutic indications and (b) first calendar year net sales, and (ii) tiered royalty payments in low double digits to high teen percentages on annual net sales. The royalty percentages are subject to reduction in the event that (i) we do not have any valid and unexpired patent claims that cover the product in the Fosun Territory, (ii) biosimilars of the product are sold in the Fosun Territory or (iii) Fosun needs to pay compensation to third parties to either avoid patent infringement or market the product in the Fosun Territory.

Manufacturing and Supply Chain 
We have established capabilities for the production of botulinum toxin type A, including bulk drug substance and injectable finished drug product. Botulinum toxin is regulated as a Tier 1 Select Agent under authority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), and as such requires that we obtain a select agent registration and perform our operations in compliance with CDC regulations. We are in good standing under our select agent registration with the CDC. We have assembled a team of experienced individuals in the technical disciplines of chemistry, biology, biosafety, and engineering and have appropriately equipped laboratory space to support ongoing research and development efforts in our botulinum toxin product development platform. We have the ability to manufacture our own botulinum toxin bulk drug substance to support our clinical trial programs and eventually, our commercial production. We also plan to use third-party manufacturers to further scale-up DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection drug product manufacturing to meet anticipated commercial demand in the event of BLA approval.
In March 2017, we entered into, and in December 2020, we amended a Technology Transfer, Validation and Commercial Fill/Finish Services Agreement (as amended, the “ABPS Services Agreement”) with Ajinomoto Althea, Inc. dba Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services (“ABPS”), a contract development and manufacturing organization. ABPS will serve as a dual supply source and provide drug product manufacturing services for us at its aseptic manufacturing facility in San Diego, California. The ABPS Services Agreement also mitigates supply chain risk by giving us a second manufacturing location for drug product manufacturing. The December 2020 amendment, among other things, modified ABPS’s dedicated manufacturing capacity and buyback obligations and our related payment obligations for our neuromodulator products, as well as provisions relating to the cancellation of product batches and the termination of the ABPS Services Agreement. Under the ABPS Amendment, we are subject to minimum purchase obligations of $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $30.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. 
In April 2021, we entered into a commercial supply agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) with Lyophilization Services of New England, Inc., a contract development and manufacturing services organization (“LSNE”), pursuant to which LSNE would serve as a non-exclusive manufacturer and supplier of our anticipated products currently under development (the “Products”). The Supply Agreement provides us with an additional source of drug manufacturing to support clinical development and commercialization of the Products to potentially mitigate supply chain risk. Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, we will be responsible for an estimated $28 million in costs associated with the design, equipment procurement and validation and facilities-related costs, which would be paid in accordance with a payment schedule based on the completion of specified milestones.
The initial term of the Supply Agreement is dependent upon the date of regulatory submission for the applicable Product and may be sooner terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the Supply Agreement. The term of the Supply Agreement may also be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. The Supply Agreement also sets forth, among other things, the Company's purchase requirements, pricing and payment information, deliverables, timelines, milestones, payment schedules, manufacturing facility obligations and development of a drug manufacturing process. The parties would also enter into quality agreements and other supplements which detail the process and product specifications for the applicable Product. The Supply Agreement also contains provisions relating to compliance with current good manufacturing practices ("cGMPs") and applicable laws and regulations, and to intellectual property, indemnification, confidentiality, representations and warranties, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.
We also manufacture and perform testing for both bulk drug substance and DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection drug product. The additional components required for our product lines and the peptide for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection are manufactured by third parties under contract with us.
Drug Substance Manufacturing
Manufacture of the drug substance for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection is based on microbial fermentation followed by product recovery and purification steps. The process is entirely free of animal and human-derived materials and depends on standard raw materials available commercially. The process is already scaled to support expected future commercial demands. Bulk drug substance is stable when stored under required conditions, which allows us to establish reserves of drug substance and allows periodic drug substance production to replenish inventories as needed.
Table of Contents

Drug Product Manufacturing
Manufacture of dose forms to support the DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection programs is currently performed at our aseptic fill-finish facility. The manufacturing process consists of bulk compounding, liquid fill and freeze-drying to support acceptable shelf-life duration. We plan to perform further scale-up of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection drug product manufacturing to meet anticipated commercial demand and may utilize current and additional internal capacity, a third-party manufacturer, such as ABPS or LSNE or a combination of both.
Outsourced Components
We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our botulinum toxin and the additional components required for our products, which includes the manufacture of bulk peptide. 
Our agreement with List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (“List Laboratories”), a developer of botulinum toxin, includes certain milestone payments related to the clinical development of our botulinum toxin products and the toxin manufacturing process. There is a royalty with an effective rate ranging from low-to-mid single-digit percentages of future sales of botulinum toxin. Our agreement with List Laboratories will remain in effect until expiration of our royalty obligations and may be terminated earlier on mutual agreement or because of a material breach by either party.
Sales and Marketing 
In September 2020, we became a commercial company and launched the prestige aesthetics portfolio, which included the Current RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and the HintMD platform. Our sales team consists of a product sales team, which is dedicated to the sales of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and will also support the potential launch of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines if approval is received, and a services sales team, which is dedicated to the commercialization of the Fintech Platform. 
Given the early stage of our launch of the Current RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and the Fintech Platform and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to determine the impact of seasonality on the sales of our products and services. However, historically the facial injectables market experiences higher sales in the second and fourth calendar quarters as compared to the first and third calendar quarters.
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, novel biological discoveries, drug development technology and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary or intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary and intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on know-how, copyright, trademarks and trade secret laws, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Such protection is also maintained using confidential non-disclosure agreements. Protection of our technologies is important for us to offer our customers proprietary services and products unavailable from our competitors, and to exclude our competitors from using technology that we have developed. If competitors in our industry have access to the same technology, our competitive position may be adversely affected.
It is possible that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire or develop, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents from our pending patent applications or for other inventions we seek to protect. Due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications, sometimes patent applications are rejected and we subsequently abandon them. It is also possible that we may develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are not patentable or that the patents of others will limit or altogether preclude our ability to do business. In addition, any patent issued to us, or any of our pending patent applications, may provide us with little or no competitive advantage, in which case we may abandon such patent, or patent applications, or

In June 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “BTRX Purchase Agreement”) with Botulinum Toxin Research Associates, Inc. (“BTRX”). Under the BTRX Purchase Agreement, we acquired all rights, title and interest in a portfolio of botulinum toxin-related patents and patent applications from BTRX and were granted the right of first negotiation and of right of first refusal with respect to other botulinum toxin-related patents owned or controlled by BTRX. 
As of December 31, 2021, Revance and its subsidiaries held approximately 450 issued patents and approximately 144 pending patent applications, including foreign counterparts of U.S. patents and applications. 43 of our patents are issued in the U.S., with the rest issued in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, various countries in Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa. In addition, we have pending patent applications in the U.S. as well as in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Singapore. We will continue to pursue additional patent protection as well as take appropriate measures to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our innovative technologies.
In October 2021, Allergan, Inc. and Allergan Pharmaceuticals Ireland (collectively, “Allergan”) filed a complaint against us and ABPS, one of our manufacturing sources of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of the following patents assigned and/or licensed to Allergan, U.S. Patent Nos. 11,033,625; 7,354,740; 8,409,828; 11,124,786; and 7,332,567. On November 3, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss. Allergan filed an amended complaint on November 24, 2021, reasserting the patents in its original Complaint and adding U.S. Patent No. 11,147,878. We filed another motion to dismiss in December 2021, but cannot be certain the motion will be granted. See “Part I—Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for more information.
On May 2, 2018, Allergan plc filed an Opposition in the European Patent Office against our European Patent No. EP 2 661 276 titled “Topical composition comprising botulinum toxin and a dye.” While the opposed patent is not material to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, we continue to take appropriate measures to defend the patent and have appealed a decision to revoke the patent, which remains in force during the appeal. On May 2, 2019 our European Patent No. EP 2 490 986 B1 for “Methods and Systems For Purifying Non-Complexed Botulinum Neurotoxin” was opposed. At a hearing in June 2021, the Opposition Division granted amended claims in our patent. The opponent appealed our successful opposition defense to the Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office. We subsequently filed an appeal to preserve our ability to use all arguments throughout the appeal process. We continue to vigorously defend this patent in the European Patent Office. We were informed in May 2019 that our patent application NC2018/0005351 pending in Colombia for “Injectable Botulinum Toxin Formulations And Methods of Use Thereof Having Long Duration of Therapeutic Effect” was opposed. We have decided to abandon this patent for reasons unrelated to the challenge to the claims.

Product Competition
We have entered and expect to continue to enter highly competitive pharmaceutical and medical device markets. Successful competitors have the ability to effectively discover, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products, as well as the ability to effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products. Numerous companies are engaged in the development, financial, research, manufacture and marketing of healthcare products competitive with those that we are developing and/or commercializing. Our competitors may also have more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Our competitors may be able to develop competing or superior technologies and processes, and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. As more companies develop new intellectual property in our markets, the possibility of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit our products or potential indications for our products increases, which could lead to litigation. In addition, current potential competitors have and could in the future assert patent infringement claims against us, which could require us to pay damages, halt or delay commercialization, suspend the manufacture of our products or reengineer or rebrand our products. See “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

We expect to compete directly with competitors that sell an injectable neuromodulator product and dermal fillers in the markets where we have a labeled indication and/or regulatory clearance. 
Injectable Botulinum Toxin Neuromodulators 
Our primary competitors for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection globally are expected to be companies offering injectable dose forms of neuromodulators, including:
•BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic, which are marketed by AbbVie. The FDA approved BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic for multiple indications, including glabellar lines, forehead lines, crow’s feet, axillary hyperhidrosis, adult and pediatric spasticity, cervical dystonia, strabismus, blepharospasm, chronic migraine, incontinence, overactive bladder and pediatric detrusor overactivity. AbbVie is a leading global pharmaceutical company with significant research, discovery, and delivery capabilities. 
•Dysport®, an injectable neuromodulator, which is marketed by Ipsen Ltd. and Galderma. Dysport® has been approved for the treatment of glabellar lines, cervical dystonia, and upper and lower limb spasticity. Galderma has rights to market the product in the U.S. and Canada and certain other countries. The health authorities of 15 European countries have also approved Dysport® for glabellar lines under the trade name Azzalure®.
•Xeomin®, an injectable neuromodulator, which is marketed by Merz Pharma ("Merz"). The FDA approved Xeomin® for the treatment of glabellar lines, cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, upper limb spasticity and chronic sialorrhea in the U.S. Xeomin® is also currently approved for the treatment of glabellar lines and therapeutic indications in certain other countries. Bocouture® (rebranded from Xeomin®), marketed by Merz, is approved for the treatment of glabellar lines in certain countries outside of the U.S.
•Jeuveau®, an injectable neuromodulator, which is marked by Evolus, Inc. in the U.S. The FDA approved Jeuveau® for the treatment of glabellar lines only. Jeuveau® is also known as NABOTA® or Nuceiva™ in certain other countries. 
•Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), an injectable neuromodulator, which is marketed by US WorldMeds. The FDA approved Myobloc® for the treatment of cervical dystonia and chronic sialorrhea.
In addition, there are other competing neuromodulators currently being developed, going through the regulatory approval process and being commercialized in the U.S. and other markets, including neuromodulators with extended duration claims. If other neuromodulators are approved, especially neuromodulators with extended duration, it would increase competition for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines, if approved, and potentially limit adoption of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. In addition, markets outside of the U.S. may or may not require adherence to the FDA’s cGMPs or the regulatory requirements of the EMA or other regulatory agencies in countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While some of these products may not meet U.S. regulatory standards, the companies operating in these markets may be able to produce products at a lower cost than U.S. and European manufacturers. In addition to the injectable neuromodulator forms, we are aware that other companies are developing topical botulinum toxins for cosmetic and therapeutics indications and are conducting clinical trials for acne, facial aesthetic and hyperhidrosis.
Dermal Fillers
Our primary competitors for the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers in the U.S. include:
•the Juvéderm family of fillers, which are marketed by AbbVie. The FDA has approved Juvéderm VOLUMA® XC, which contains lidocaine, for the correction of age-related volume loss in the mid-face for up to 2 years; Juvéderm® Ultra XC, which contains lidocaine, for injection into the lips and perioral area for lip augmentation; Juvéderm Ultra Plus XC, which contains lidocaine, for injection in the facial tissue to smooth wrinkles and folds, especially around the nose and mouth; and Juvéderm Volbella® XC for use in the lips for lip augmentation and for correction of perioral lines. 
Table of Contents

•the Restylane® family of fillers, which are marketed by Galderma. The FDA has approved Restylane® Refyne for the treatment of moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds; Restylane® Defyne for the treatment of moderate to severe, deep facial wrinkles and folds; Restylane® and Restylane-L® for mid-to-deep injection into the facial tissue for the correction of moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds, such as nasolabial folds and for injection into the lips; and Restylane® Lyft, formerly marketed as Perlane-L®, which contains lidocaine, for cheek augmentation and the correction of age-related mid-face contour deficiencies. And most recently, the FDA approved Restylane® Contour for cheek augmentation and for the correction of midface contour deficiencies and Restylane® Kysse for lip augmentation and for correction of upper perioral wrinkles. 
•RADIESSE® and RADIESSE® (+), a calcium hydroxylapatite marketed by Merz, are dermal fillers that are used for smoothing moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds, such as nasolabial. RADIESSE® is also used for correcting volume loss in the back of the hands.
•Sculptra® Aesthetic, a poly-L-lactic acid based dermal filler marketed by Galderma, to correct shallow to deep nasolabial fold contour deficiencies and other facial wrinkles in which deep dermal grid pattern (cross-hatch) injection technique is appropriate. 
•Belotero Balance®, a hyaluronic acid based dermal filler marketed by Merz, to temporarily smooth out and fill in moderate to- severe nasolabial folds.
We are aware of competing dermal fillers currently commercialized or under development in the U.S. and are monitoring the competitive pipeline environment. 
Services Competition 
Aesthetic Fintech Platforms
The payment processing solutions market is large and competitive, but OPULTM’s industry focus on aesthetic practices and its status as a PayFac provides a competitive advantage. OPULTM, leveraging its predecessor HintMD platform, has focused on aesthetic practices since inception and has developed a strong understanding of the unique needs and requirements of aesthetic practices.
OPULTM expects competition to increase in the future from both established competitors and new market entrants. Current competitors include:
•Incumbent payment processing solution providers;
•Banks that offer payment processing solutions; and
•Electronic medical record systems that offer payment solutions.
As we continue to develop and add features and functionality to OPULTM, we expect that we will compete with others who provide loyalty and customer retention solutions.
Government Regulations
Product Approval Process in the U.S.
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), its implementing regulations, and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our product candidates, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a BLA to the FDA and approval of the BLA by the FDA before marketing in the U.S.
Table of Contents

The process of obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial sale and distribution and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold on clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current good laboratory practices (“GLPs”);
•submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin;
•approval by an institutional review board ("IRB"), at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s cGCP regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of a BLA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection, if the FDA deems it as a requirement, of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, potency, quality and purity, as well as compliance with applicable Quality System Regulations (“QSR”), for devices;
•potential inspections by the FDA of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
•potential review of the BLA by an external advisory committee to the FDA, whose recommendations are not binding on the FDA; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale.
Preclinical Studies
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential toxicity and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance, or for other reasons. 
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and effectiveness. Each protocol must 
Table of Contents

be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of clinical trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into a limited population of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for some diseases, or when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the disease or condition for which the product candidate is intended to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•Phase 2. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population, but larger than in Phase 1, to identify possible adverse events and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to assess dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, and provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, such as several hundred to several thousand, at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. These trials typically have at least 2 groups of patients who, in a blinded fashion, receive either the product or a placebo. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Phase 4 trials can be initiated by the drug sponsor or as a condition of BLA approval by the FDA.
Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees.
Once the FDA receives a BLA, it has 60 days to review the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete and the data are readable, before it accepts the BLA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA, the FDA has twelve months from submission in which to complete its initial review of a standard BLA and make a decision on the application, and eight 
Table of Contents

months from submission for a priority BLA, and such deadline is referred to as the PDUFA date. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates for either standard or priority BLAs. The review process and the PDUFA date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA date. 
After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, potency, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval and limit commercial opportunity.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA can inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional clinical testing or information before a BLA can be approved. 
The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the BLA. The complete response letter describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA during review. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be submitted and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to a BLA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the supplement. As with new BLAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any biologic products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, known as “off-label use,” industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. The FDA and other agencies closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, and although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of 
Table of Contents

physicians in their choice of treatments but the FDA does restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. Failure to comply with these or other FDA requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, possible civil or criminal penalties or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity.
We currently manufacture clinical drug supplies using a combination of third-party manufacturers and our own manufacturing facility in order to support both of our product candidates and plan to do so on a commercial scale if our product candidates are approved. Our future collaborators may also utilize third parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such collaborator. We and our third-party manufacturers are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our biologic product candidate, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible to be the basis for an application for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process, which coincides with the period of product development and regulatory review. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product may be extended, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within 60 days after drug approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension. In the future, we may apply for extension of patent term for one or more of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent term beyond the current expiration date of one of our patents, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s BLA. Specifically, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until twelve years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. However, an application may be submitted after four years, which initiates a process in which the innovator BLA holder and the biosimilar applicant identify patents that could be litigated and resolve patent disputes.
Product Approval Process Outside the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing manufacturing, clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers, and others may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other 
Table of Contents

healthcare laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market and distribute any product for which we obtain marketing approval. The federal and state fraud and abuse laws that restrict certain business practices in the biotechnology industry include but are not limited to anti-kickback and false claims statutes. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute.
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and the federal civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free products to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. 
The federal transparency requirements under the ACA, commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, as defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and, and teaching hospitals and information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Similar state, local and foreign healthcare laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the biotechnology industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to 
Table of Contents

report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, thus complicating compliance efforts.
In General
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities now and in the future could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government healthcare programs, integrity oversight and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
U.S. and Foreign Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations 
In the ordinary course of our business, we may process personal data. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy, security, and protection. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (“UK”) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”). In addition, several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act. The most significant of these privacy laws for us is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, and each of their implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”), which applies to certain of our actions within the health care sector. HIPAA imposes strict privacy, security, and breach notification obligations and standards on “covered entities” related to their use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, defined by HIPAA as “protected health information” or “PHI”. Covered entities are defined under HIPAA to include healthcare providers that undertake certain electronic transmissions of PHI, such as submitting electronic claims for reimbursement for the treatment of patients. Many of our health care provider customers are considered to be covered entities. HIPAA also applies to companies that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI for or on behalf of a covered entity (called “business associates”). Even though we are generally not a covered entity or a business associate in our general business activities, HIPAA limits the amount of data including PHI that can be shared between our business and our health care provider customers. In certain of our activities, Revance or Hint also may be considered a business associate of Hint's aesthetic practice customers and directly subject to HIPAA, for instance when we enter into business associate agreements with covered entities related to our HintMD business, as discussed more below. We also may be subject to certain of HIPAA’s provisions as a covered entity related to our company health plan. HIPAA is generally enforced by the Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) that can bring enforcement actions against companies that violate HIPAA’s privacy, security or breach notification rules and levy significant civil fines and/or require changes to the manner in which PHI is used and disclosed. The U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction under HIPAA to bring criminal enforcement actions against covered entities, business associates and possibly other entities for fraudulent misuse of PHI and other criminal acts. Further, HIPAA provides state attorneys general authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. If we are in possession of PHI as a business associate or as part of our health plan covered entity and we have an unauthorized use or disclosure of the PHI, we will be required pursuant to the HIPAA breach notification rule, to notify our customer covered entity, or notify patients, and/or OCR and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), of which OCR is a part. In addition to HIPAA, there could also be 
Table of Contents

other federal privacy laws that might impact smaller parts of our operations such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act when we undertake employee screening and background checks. 
In addition to federal privacy laws, such as HIPAA, we are also subject to federal laws that apply to how we conduct consumer marketing and advertising. The most significant of these federal laws is Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTCA”), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices directed toward consumers. The FTC has brought aggressive enforcement actions against companies they believe have made material misrepresentations on their website or mobile app privacy statements with respect to their processing of personal data of consumers. Additionally, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the “TCPA”) governs the manner in which we send mobile phone marketing and commercial messages to consumers. The Federal Communication Commission enforces the TCPA, however, the TCPA includes a private right of action with statutory damages and there have been lawsuits brought by private plaintiffs against biopharmaceutical and medical device companies. 
In addition, state privacy laws include consumer protection laws that are very similar to the FTCA and that are enforced by state attorneys general. Other state laws, including those that govern health information and may be more stringent than HIPAA, also govern our processing of personal data, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating our compliance efforts, potentially increasing the financial costs of compliance, and exposure to liability. 
For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collecting, using, and disclosing personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. In addition, it is anticipated that the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, establish restrictions on personal data retention, expand the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws may require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data. 
Our operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy laws with which we, our customers, and our vendors must comply. For example, European data privacy and security laws (including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”) and United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”)) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. For example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances. The processing of ‘special categories of personal data’ (such as data concerning health, biometric data used for unique identification purposes and genetic information) imposes further heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators. 
In addition to the above privacy laws that are generally applicable to our business, our physician customers use the HintMD platform to process personal data and PHI. Where we are determined to be a business associate of our physician customers who are covered entities pursuant to HIPAA, the HIPAA security and breach rules would apply directly to our business associate activities. Further, the terms of the business associate agreements we enter into with covered entities would also generally apply parts of the HIPAA privacy rule to our activities.

The costs of compliance with HIPAA, federal and state privacy laws and breach notification laws, the GDPR and other foreign privacy laws as well as the associated burdens imposed by such non-harmonized laws, may limit the use or adoption of the HintMD platform, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities related to noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we undertake our business or close sales of the HintMD platform, any of which could harm our business. Moreover, if our employees fail to adhere to the company’s processes and practices for the protection and/or appropriate use of personal data or PHI, or in other ways violate privacy laws or breach notification laws, it may damage our reputation and brand. Finally, any failure by our vendors to comply with the terms of our contractual provisions or the applicable privacy laws or breach notification laws, could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.
As our business continues to expand in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and as laws and regulations continue to be passed and their interpretations continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions, additional laws and regulations may become relevant to us. See the section titled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Government and Industry Regulation” for additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
Security Failures and Breach Notification Laws 
Our information technology systems, cloud-based computing services and those of our current and any future vendors, collaborators, contractors, or consultants are vulnerable to interruption and being compromised. We and the third parties upon which we rely may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. 
We are required to comply with laws, rules and regulations that require us to maintain the security of personal data. We may have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security incidents. In addition to the breach notification obligations under HIPAA, every state in the U.S. now has similar breach notification obligation laws (“breach notification laws”). Breach notification laws vary from state to state but upon an unauthorized disclosure of certain sensitive personal data, generally require notification to data subjects as well as notification in some circumstances to state agencies, such as the state attorneys general or the consumer protection bureau, and in some circumstances, notification to media. 
See the section titled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy” for additional information about our use of information technology systems and about the risks to our business associated with such information technology systems.
Medical Device Distribution
As the distributor of Teoxane’s RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, we are required to maintain certain licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, approvals or other types of state and local permissions in order to comply with various regulations regarding the distribution of medical devices, and we must cooperate with Teoxane in the event of any medical device reports (adverse events) or product recalls. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements may take many months, and may require the expenditure of substantial resources. Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions, including the revocation or suspension of licenses, registrations or accreditations, and can also subject us to plans of correction, monitoring, civil monetary penalties, civil injunctive relief and/or criminal penalties. Failure to obtain state regulatory approval will also prevent distribution of products where such approval is necessary and will limit our ability to generate revenue. Maintaining the necessary compliance infrastructure to support these activities will result in increased expense.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Patients in the United States and elsewhere generally rely on third‑party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Accordingly, our ability to commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any 
Table of Contents

future product candidates for therapeutic indications such as cervical dystonia, adult upper limb spasticity will depend in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. As a threshold for coverage and reimbursement, third-party payors generally require that drug products have been approved for marketing by the FDA. Third-party payors also are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. We may not obtain adequate third-party coverage or reimbursement for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates for therapeutic indications, or we may be required to sell them at a discount.
We expect that third-party payors will consider the efficacy, cost effectiveness and safety of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in determining whether to approve reimbursement for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for therapeutic indications and at what level. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we do not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for therapeutic indications from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the U.S.; therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Further, coverage under certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, may not be available for certain of our product candidates. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product candidate does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product candidate. As a result, the coverage determination process will likely be a time-consuming and costly process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Further, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which the Company receives regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In some foreign countries, particularly Canada and European countries, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies, and so we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products, including DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, to other available therapies. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control company profits.
Healthcare Reform 
The ACA was passed in March 2010, and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and continues to significantly impact the U.S. biotechnology industry. There have been challenges by the executive, judicial and legislative branches of government to certain aspects of the ACA, including some challenges that still remain and intended to delay or prevent the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, which began January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. 
In addition, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing

and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the formal presidential administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration's proposals. The FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed to January 1, 2023. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Payments Regulation 
Numerous laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. All Fintech Platform operations are conducted by Revance employees who will be subject to the regulations and requirements described in this section. 
The Fintech Platform is currently subject to certain payments-related compliance obligations pursuant to its contractual obligations under its payment solutions agreement (the “Payment Facilitator Agreement”) with MetaBank, National Association and First Data Merchant Services LLC ("Fiserv"). These requirements relate to, among other things, operating pursuant to an anti-money laundering policy that is consistent with the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the economic sanctions regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.
In addition, credit and debit card processing are subject to industry-created and industry specific rules and regulations, including those of Visa Inc. and MasterCard International Inc. (“Rules”). The Rules apply to the Fintech Platform because of its contractual obligations pursuant to the Payment Facilitator Agreement. Failure to comply with the Rules can result in termination of the Payment Facilitator Agreement or other key supplier agreements. Changes in the Rules could also mandate material changes in how the Fintech Platform solicits new potential clients and fee structures applicable to its agreements with clients, which could result in decreased margins on services of the Fintech Platform.
Rules, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ("PCI DSS") of the PCI Security Standards Council establish security standards applicable to participants in payment card processing. Changes in those Rules may impact the Fintech Platform’s ability to collect, store and process card data or the ability of the Fintech Platform’s suppliers to do the same for the Fintech Platform or its clients.
The Fintech Platform sends texts, emails, and other communications as a part of its services, such as when providing digital receipts, emailing customers about new features and functionality or administrative platform support such as for resetting a password. Communications laws and regulations apply to this activity in the U.S. and elsewhere, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”). Compliance with such regulations may impact the Fintech Platform’s ability to communicate with its customers or the end-user customers.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal, local, state, and foreign regulatory and law enforcement agencies regulate financial services and enforce consumer protection laws, including credit, deposit, and

payments services, and other similar services. These agencies have broad consumer protection mandates, and they promulgate, interpret, and enforce rules and regulations that affect our business.
We monitor developments in payments regulations and continue to develop our compliance program based on regulatory trends and changes in our risk profile.
Environment, Health and Safety
We are voluntarily assessing and publicly reporting our greenhouse gas emissions and water usage, and have begun to take action to reduce such emissions and usage. For example, we have established employee commuter programs, evaluated the energy efficiency of our buildings and installed low-flow water fixtures. Various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the California Air Resources Board is in the process of drafting regulations to meet state emissions targets. Based on current information and subject to the finalization of the proposed regulations, we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs. However, because we are not an energy-intensive business, we do not anticipate being subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that would likely be material to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
We are also subject to other federal, state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment. We use hazardous materials, chemicals, and various compounds in our research and development activities and cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Certain misuse or accidents involving these materials could lead to significant litigation, fines and penalties. We have implemented proactive programs to reduce and minimize the risk of hazardous materials incidents.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 495 employees, all of which are located in the U.S. Our employee base grew from 193 as of December 31, 2019, after acquiring HintMD and hiring more than 280 people, including our new field sales force. As of December 31, 2021, there were no unions represented within our employee base.
We believe that empowered employees make a difference in our ability to execute our strategy. As such, we strive to provide an inclusive, rewarding and engaging environment for employees to develop professionally and contribute to our success. Revance was certified as a Great Place to Work® by the Great Place to Work® Institute for the fourth consecutive year in 2021.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe in equal opportunity employment and do not tolerate discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin/ancestry, age, disability, marital or veteran status. In addition, because we believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, in mid-2020, we formed a Diversity and Inclusion Committee, comprised of employees and led by our Senior Vice President, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary. This committee has a mission to foster diversity, equality and belonging at our workplace. The committee’s mission is supported by consciously learning, educating and empowering our employees to bring awareness to and help dismantle systems of oppression, including systemic racism and overt and unconscious bias, both in the workplace and within our communities. The committee is currently working on developing a comprehensive program to strengthen our culture of inclusion and belonging. As a reflection of this commitment, in 2021, we established Company performance goals, which are also included as performance measures in the bonus program for our executive officers, tied to the achievement of specified diversity and inclusion initiatives.
As of December 31, 2021, women represented 56% of our workforce and 43% of our leadership team (defined as our management team and executive employees), and ethnic minorities represented 47% of our workforce and 43% of our leadership team.

All employees are trained on workplace safety, including security and inspection, work related injuries and emergency protocols. We also conduct special additional training for laboratory staff. 
Also, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly implemented policies to protect our employees and provide solutions to enable our employees to manage their work and personal responsibilities. In addition, we established a Pandemic Response Team, comprised of senior leaders, to help guide and direct activities associated with local governance and business requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
As our business continues to grow and develop, we are focused on building a sustainable enterprise for all of our stakeholders while making a positive impact on the communities in which we serve. As a first step, we completed our inaugural ESG report which details our commitments and efforts to operate sustainably and responsibly, including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and prevailing social issues in 2020. The report was guided by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework and can be found on the “Corporate Governance” and “Sustainability” sections of our website.
