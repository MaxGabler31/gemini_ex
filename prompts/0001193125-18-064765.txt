 Disclosure of reserves 
 Summary of oil and gas reserves at year-end
The table below summarizes the net proved reserves for the company, as at December 31, 2017, as detailed in the Supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities part of the Financial section, starting on page 32 of this report. 
 All of the companys reported reserves are located in Canada. The company has reported proved reserves based on the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period ending December 31. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels. No major discovery or other favourable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2017 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date. 

 | Liquids (a) | Natural gas | Synthetic oil | Bitumen | Total oil-equivalent basis 
 | millions ofbarrels | billions of cubic feet | millions ofbarrels | millions ofbarrels | millions ofbarrels 
Net proved reserves: | | | | | 
Developed | 9 | 282 | 473 | 591 | 1,120 
Undeveloped | 35 | 359 | - | 355 | 450 
Total net proved | 44 | 641 | 473 | 946 | 1,570 


(a) | Liquids include crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs). NGL proved reserves are not material and are therefore included under liquids.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the company only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves. Although the company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors, including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, royalty framework and significant changes in long-term oil and gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the companys capital spending and also impact its partners capacity to fund their share of joint projects. The companys operating decisions and its outlook for future production volumes are not impacted by proved reserves as disclosed under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission definition. 
 As a result of improved prices in 2017, an additional 0.3 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and Cold Lake now qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2017. Among the factors that would result in additional amounts being recognized as proved reserves at some point in the future are a further recovery in yearly average price levels, a further decline in costs and additional planned investment in reliability improvements. Under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributable to Imperial.

Technologies used in establishing proved reserves estimates 
 Imperials proved reserves in 2017 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results. 
 Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements, including seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software, and commercially available data analysis packages. 
 In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates. 
 Preparation of reserves estimates 
 Imperial has a dedicated reserves management group that is separate from the base operating organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of Imperials proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for Imperials proved reserves. In addition, this group provides training to personnel involved in the reserve estimation and reporting processes within Imperial. 
 The reserves management group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates. Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the systems controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance, and a rigorous peer review. No changes may be made to reserves estimates in the central database, including the addition of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless those changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the base operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and endorsement by the operating organization and the reserves management group, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management and the companys board of directors. 
 The internal qualified reserves evaluator is a professional geoscientist registered in Alberta, Canada and has over 19 years of petroleum industry experience, including 13 years of reserves related experience. The position provides leadership to the internal reserves management group and is responsible for filing a reserves report with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities. The companys internal reserves evaluation staff consists of 39 persons with an average of 13 years of relevant technical experience in evaluating reserves, of whom 21 persons are qualified reserves evaluators for purposes of Canadian securities regulatory requirements. The companys internal reserves evaluation management team is made up of 20 persons with an average of 14 years of relevant experience in evaluating and managing the evaluation of reserves.

Proved undeveloped reserves 
 As at December 31, 2017, approximately 29 percent of the companys proved reserves were proved undeveloped reserves reflecting volumes of 450 million oil-equivalent barrels. Most of the undeveloped reserves are associated with the Cold Lake field. This compared to 319 million oil-equivalent barrels of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2016. The increase of 131 million oil-equivalent barrels of proved undeveloped reserves includes 93 million oil-equivalent barrels at Cold Lake. Conversion of proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed was not material in 2017. 
 Proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more represent about 65 percent (291 million oil-equivalent barrels) of proved undeveloped reserves and are associated with Cold Lakes ongoing drilling program. These undeveloped reserves are planned to be developed in a staged approach to align with operational capacity and efficient capital spending commitment over the life of the field. The company is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approval, royalty framework, government policies, consumer preferences and significant changes in long-term oil and gas price levels. 
 One of the companys requirements to report resources as proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments towards the development of the reserves. The company has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require a long lead-time in order to be developed. The company made investments of about $150 million during the year to progress the development of proved undeveloped reserves in its Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets and at Cold Lake. These investments represented about 36 percent of the $416 million in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures. Investments made by the company to develop quantities which no longer meet the SEC definition of proved reserves due to 2017 average prices are included in the $416 million of Upstream capital and exploration expenditures.

 Exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources 
 Cold Lake 
 To maintain production at Cold Lake, capital expenditures for additional production wells and associated facilities are required periodically. 
 The company also conducts experimental pilot operations to improve recovery of bitumen from wells by means of new drilling, production or recovery techniques. 
 Aspen, Cold Lake expansion and other oil sands activities 
 The company filed a regulatory application for a new in-situ oil sands project at Aspen in December 2013, using steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) technology to develop the project in three phases producing about 45,000 barrels per day before royalties, per phase. 
 In 2015, the company amended the regulatory application to develop the Aspen project using solvent-assisted, steam-assisted gravity drainage (SA-SAGD) technology. The technology significantly improves capital efficiency and lowers greenhouse gas intensity versus the existing SAGD technologies. The project is proposed to be executed in two phases producing about 75,000 barrels per day before royalties, per phase. Development timing is subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. In April 2016, Imperial was notified by the Alberta Energy Regulator that the projects environment impact assessment was deemed complete. No final investment decision has been made. 
 In March 2016, Imperial filed a regulatory application for the Cold Lake Expansion project to develop the Grand Rapids interval using SA-SAGD technology. The project is proposed to produce 50,000 barrels per day, before royalties. Development timing is subject to regulatory approval and market conditions. In March 2017, Imperial was notified by the Alberta Energy Regulator that the projects environmental impact assessment was deemed complete. No final investment decision has been made.

Work continues on technical evaluations to support potential Corner and Clyden in-situ development regulatory applications. 
 The company also has interests in other oil sands leases in the Athabasca and Peace River areas of northern Alberta. Evaluation wells completed on these leased areas established the presence of bitumen. The company continues to evaluate these leases to determine their potential for future development. 
 Other activities 
 The company is continuing to evaluate, develop and produce resources in its Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets in the western provinces. 
 A decision has been made not to proceed at this time with Horn River development which resulted in a 2017 impairment charge of $396 million, before tax, associated with the write-off of the net book value of the Horn River assets. 
 Mackenzie Delta 
 In 1999, the company and three other companies entered into an agreement to study the feasibility of developing Mackenzie Delta gas, anchored by three large onshore natural gas fields. 
 In 2017, a decision was made not to proceed at this time with the Mackenzie gas project (MGP) which resulted in an impairment charge of $379 million, before tax, associated with the write-off of the net book value of the MGP assets. The company retains a 100 percent interest in the largest of these fields. 
 Beaufort Sea 
 In 2007, the company acquired a 50 percent interest in an exploration licence in the Beaufort Sea. As part of the evaluation, a 3-D seismic survey was conducted in 2008 and the company has since carried out data collection programs to support environmental studies and safe exploration drilling operations. 
 In 2010, the company executed an agreement to cross-convey interests with another company to acquire a 25 percent interest in an additional Beaufort Sea exploration licence. As a result of that agreement, the company operates both licences and its interest in the original licence was reduced to 25 percent. The exploration licences are held through 2019 and 2020, respectively. 
 In 2013, the company and its joint venture partners filed a project description, initiating the formal regulatory review of the project. 
 In December 2016, the Federal Government of Canada declared Arctic waters off limits to new offshore oil and gas licences for five years subject to review at the end of that period. Existing licences will not be impacted. The Federal Government continues to consult with existing leaseholders, including Imperial. Current activities continue to focus on data gathering and community consultation. Imperial is seeking extended terms for the Beaufort Sea exploration licences with the Federal Government. No final investment decision has been made. 
 Liquefied natural gas (LNG) activity 
 WCC LNG Ltd., jointly owned by the company (20 percent) and ExxonMobil Canada Ltd. (80 percent), was granted an export licence in 2013 for up to 30 million tonnes of LNG per year for a period of 25 years. In 2016, the licence period was extended to 40 years. The project is currently in the pre-application phase in a British Columbia environmental assessment process. No final investment decision has been made. 
 Exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources extracted by mining methods 
 The company continues to evaluate other undeveloped, mineable oil sands acreage in the Athabasca region.

Present activities 
 Review of principal ongoing activities 
 Cold Lake 
 Cold Lake is an in-situ heavy oil bitumen operation. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to the companys refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. 
 During 2017, net production at Cold Lake was about 132,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 162,000 barrels per day. 
 Kearl 
 Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, which is processed through extraction and froth treatment trains. The company holds a 70.96 percent participating interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to the companys refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. 
 During 2017, the companys share of Kearls net bitumen production was about 123,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 126,000 barrels per day. Increased 2017 production reflects improved reliability associated with the mining and ore preparation operations. 
 Imperial continues to progress work to increase Kearl annual average production to 240,000 barrels of bitumen per day (Imperials share would be about 170,000 barrels of bitumen per day), through planned investment including supplemental crushing capacity and flow distribution interconnects at Kearl to enhance reliability, increase redundancy and reduce downtime. The work is expected to be complete by year-end 2019. 
 Syncrude 
 Syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. The company holds a 25 percent participating interest in the joint venture. The produced synthetic crude oil is shipped to the companys refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. 
 In 2017, the companys share of Syncrudes net production of synthetic crude oil was about 57,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 62,000 barrels per day. 
 The Province of Alberta, in its capacity as lessor of Cold Lake, Kearl and Syncrude oil sands leases, is entitled to a royalty on production. Royalties are subject to the oil sands royalty regulations which are based upon a sliding scale determined largely by the price of crude oil. 
 Total Upstream capital and exploration expenditures were $416 million in 2017. Investments were primarily related to sustaining activity in support of oil sands and unconventional assets. 
 Delivery commitments 
 The company has no material commitments to provide a fixed and determinable quantity of oil or gas under existing contracts and agreements.

Western provinces 
 The companys bitumen leases include about 194,000 net acres of oil sands leases near Cold Lake and an area of about 34,000 net acres at Kearl. The company also has about 80,000 net acres of undeveloped, mineable oil sands acreage in the Athabasca region. In addition, the company has interests in other bitumen oil sands leases in the Athabasca areas totalling about 193,000 net acres, which include about 62,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Clyden area, about 34,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Aspen area and about 30,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Corner area. These 193,000 net acres are suitable for in-situ recovery techniques. 
 The companys share of Syncrude joint venture leases covering about 63,000 net acres accounts for the entire synthetic oil acreage. 
 Oil sands leases have an exploration period of 15 years and are continued beyond that point by meeting the minimum level of evaluation, by payment of escalating rentals, or by production. The majority of the acreage in Cold Lake, Kearl and Syncrude is continued by production. 
 The company holds interests in an additional 1,173,000 net acres of developed and undeveloped land in the western provinces related to crude oil and natural gas. 
 Crude oil and natural gas leases and licences from the western provinces have exploration periods ranging from two to 15 years and are continued beyond that point by proven production capability. 
 Canada lands 
 Land holdings in Canada lands primarily include exploration licence (EL) acreage in the Beaufort Sea of about 252,000 net acres and significant discovery licence (SDL) acreage in the Mackenzie Delta and Beaufort Sea areas of about 183,000 net acres. 
 Exploration licences on Canada lands and Atlantic offshore have a finite term. If a significant discovery is made, a SDL may be granted that holds the acreage under the SDL indefinitely, subject to certain conditions. 
 The companys net acreage in Canada lands is either continued by production or held through ELs and SDLs. 
 Atlantic offshore 
 The Atlantic offshore acreage is continued by production or held by SDLs.

Downstream 
 Supply 
 The company supplements its own production of crude oil, condensate and petroleum products with substantial purchases from a number of other sources at negotiated market prices. Purchases are made under both spot and term contracts from domestic and foreign sources, including ExxonMobil. 
Transportation 
 Imperial currently transports the companys crude oil production and third party crude oil required to supply refineries by contracted pipelines, common carrier pipelines and rail. To mitigate uncertainty associated with the timing of industry pipeline projects and pipeline capacity constraints, the company has developed rail infrastructure. The Edmonton rail terminal commenced operation in 2015 and has total capacity to ship up to 210,000 barrels per day of crude oil. 
Refining 
 The company owns and operates three refineries, which process predominantly Canadian crude oil. In 2017, Imperial decided to discontinue manufacturing base stocks, associated waxes and finished lubricants at its Strathcona Refinery lube complex and lube oil blend plant. Continued operations are planned at the refinery lube complex until the end of February 2018 and at the blend plant until mid-2018. In addition to crude oil, the company purchases finished products to supplement its refinery production. 
 In 2017, capital expenditures of about $139 million were made at the companys refineries. Capital expenditures focused mainly on refinery projects to improve reliability, feedstock flexibility, energy efficiency and environmental performance. 
 The approximate average daily volumes of refinery throughput during the three years ended December 31, 2017, and the daily rated capacities of the refineries as at December 31, 2017, were as follows.

 Refinery throughput averaged 383,000 barrels per day in 2017, up from 362,000 barrels per day in 2016. Capacity utilization increased to 91 percent from 86 percent in 2016, reflecting reduced turnaround maintenance activity. 
 Refinery throughput averaged 362,000 barrels per day in 2016, compared to 386,000 barrels per day in 2015. Capacity utilization decreased to 86 percent from 92 percent in 2015, reflecting the more significant scope of turnaround maintenance activity in 2016. 
 Distribution 
 The company maintains a nationwide distribution system, to handle bulk and packaged petroleum products moving from refineries to market by pipeline, tanker, rail and road transport. The company owns and operates natural gas liquids and products pipelines in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario and has interests in the capital stock of one crude oil and two products pipeline companies.

Marketing 
 The company markets petroleum products throughout Canada under well-known brand names, most notably Esso and Mobil, to all types of customers. 
 Imperial supplies petroleum products to the motoring public through Esso and Mobil-branded retail sites and independent marketers. On average during the year, there were more than 1,800 retail sites operating under a branded wholesaler model whereby Imperial supplies fuel to independent third parties who own and operate retail sites in alignment with Esso and Mobil brand standards. The Mobil fuels brand was launched in Canada in 2017 with the announcement of plans to convert more than 200 existing unbranded third party retail sites. Completion of this Mobil conversion is anticipated in 2018. 
 Imperial sells petroleum products to large industrial and transportation customers, independent marketers, resellers, as well as other refiners. The company serves agriculture, residential heating and commercial markets through branded resellers. In 2017, as part of Imperials truck transport business transition to a branded wholesaler model, the company announced plans to convert over 70 commercial third party sites to the Esso brand.

 Research expenditures are mainly spent on developing technologies to improve bitumen recovery, reduce costs and reduce the environmental impact of upstream operations, including technologies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity, supporting environmental and process improvements in the refineries, as well as accessing ExxonMobils research worldwide. 
 The company has scientific research agreements with affiliates of ExxonMobil, which provide for technical and engineering work to be performed by all parties, the exchange of technical information and the assignment and licensing of patents, and patent rights. These agreements provide mutual access to scientific and operating data related to nearly every phase of the petroleum and petrochemical operations of the parties. 
 Environmental protection 
 The company regards protecting the environment in connection with its various operations as a priority. The company works in cooperation with government agencies, industry associations and communities to address existing, and to anticipate potential, environmental protection issues. In the past five years, the company has made capital and operating expenditures of about $5.7 billion on environmental protection and facilities. In 2017, the companys environmental capital and operating expenditures totalled approximately $0.6 billion, which was spent primarily on activities to protect the air, land and water, including remediation projects. Capital and operating expenditures relating to environmental protection are expected to be about $0.6 billion in 2018.

 Competition 
 The Canadian petroleum, natural gas and chemical industries are highly competitive. Competition exists in the search for and development of new sources of supply, the construction and operation of crude oil, natural gas and refined products pipelines and facilities and the refining, distribution and marketing of petroleum products and chemicals. The petroleum industry also competes with other industries in supplying energy, fuel and meeting other needs of consumers.

Government regulation 
 Petroleum and natural gas rights 
 Most of the companys petroleum and natural gas rights were acquired from governments, either federal or provincial. These rights, in the form of leases or licences, are generally acquired for cash or work commitments. A lease or licence entitles the holder to explore for petroleum and / or natural gas on the leased lands for a specified period. 
 In western provinces, the lease holder can produce the petroleum or natural gas discovered on the leased lands and retains the rights based on continued production. Oil sands leases are retained by meeting the minimum level of evaluation, payment of rentals, or by production. 
 The holder of a licence relating to Canada lands and the Atlantic offshore can apply for a SDL if a discovery is made. If granted, the SDL holds the lands indefinitely subject to certain conditions. The holder may then apply for a production licence in order to produce petroleum or natural gas from the licenced land. 
 Project approval 
 Approvals and licences from relevant provincial or federal governmental or regulatory bodies are required for the company to carry out, or make modifications to, its oil and gas activities. The project approval process for major projects can involve, among other things, environmental assessments (including relevant mitigation measures), stakeholder and Indigenous consultation and input regarding project concerns, and public hearings. Approval may be subject to various conditions and commitments arising through these processes. 
 Crude oil 
 Production 
 The maximum allowable gross production of crude oil from wells in Canada is subject to limitations by various regulatory authorities on the basis of engineering and conservation principles. 
Exports 
 Export contracts of more than one year for light crude oil and petroleum products and two years for heavy crude oil (including bitumen) require the prior approval of the National Energy Board (NEB) and the Government of Canada. 
 Natural gas 
 Production 
 The maximum allowable gross production of natural gas from wells in Canada is subject to limitations by various regulatory authorities. These limitations are to ensure oil recovery is not adversely impacted by accelerated gas production practices. These limitations do not impact gas reserves, only the timing of production of the reserves and did not have a significant impact on Imperials 2017 gas production rates. 
Exports 
 The Government of Canada has the authority to regulate the export price for natural gas and has a gas export pricing policy, which accommodates export prices for natural gas negotiated between Canadian exporters and U.S. importers. 
 Exports of natural gas from Canada require approval by the NEB and the Government of Canada. The Government of Canada allows the export of natural gas by NEB order without volume limitation for terms not exceeding 24 months. 
 
17 
 
Royalties 
 The Government of Canada and the provinces in which the company produces crude oil and natural gas, impose royalties on production from lands where they own the mineral rights. Some producing provinces also receive revenue by imposing taxes on production from lands where they do not own the mineral rights. 
 Different royalties are imposed by the Government of Canada and each of the producing provinces. Royalties imposed on crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids vary depending on a number of parameters, including well production volumes, selling prices and recovery methods. For information with respect to royalties for Cold Lake, Syncrude and Kearl, see Upstream section under Item 1. 
 Investment Canada Act 
 The Investment Canada Act requires Government of Canada approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by Canadians. The acquisition of natural resource properties may, in certain circumstances, be considered a transaction that constitutes an acquisition of control of a Canadian business requiring Government of Canada approval. 
 The Act also requires notification of the establishment of new unrelated businesses in Canada by entities not controlled by Canadians, but does not require Government of Canada approval except when the new business is related to Canadas cultural heritage or national identity. The Government of Canada is also authorized to take any measures that it considers advisable to protect national security, including the outright prohibition of a foreign investment in Canada. By virtue of the majority stock ownership of the company by ExxonMobil, the company is considered to be an entity which is not controlled by Canadians. 
 Competition Act 
 The Competition Bureau ensures that Canadian businesses and consumers prosper in a competitive and innovative marketplace. The Competition Bureau is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Competition Act (the Act). A merger transaction, whether or not notifiable, is subject to examination by the Commissioner of the Competition Bureau to determine whether the merger will have, or is likely to have, the effect of preventing or lessening substantially competition in a definable market. The assessment of the competitive effects of a merger is made with reference to the factors identified under the Act. 
 An Advance Ruling Certificate (ARC) may be issued by the Commissioner to a party or parties to a proposed merger transaction who want to be assured that the transaction will not give rise to proceedings under section 92 of the Act. Section 102 of the Act provides that an ARC may be issued when the Commissioner is satisfied that there would not be sufficient grounds on which to apply to the Competition Tribunal for an order against a proposed merger. The issuance of an ARC is discretionary. An ARC cannot be issued for a transaction that has been completed, nor does an ARC ensure approval of the transaction by any agency other than the Competition Bureau.
