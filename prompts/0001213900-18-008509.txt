ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
Effective October 30, 2017, the Company entered into a License Agreement (the “License”) with Recruiter.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Recruiter”) under which Recruiter granted the Company’s newly created subsidiary, VocaWorks, Inc. (“Vocaworks”), a license to use certain of Recruiter’s proprietary software and related intellectual property. The Company is rebranding itself under the “VocaWorks” brand name and moving into the rapidly expanding field of online and mobile-enabled staffing and talent acquisition solutions through its entry into the License with Recruiter. VocaWorks will initially offer a native mobile iOS app solution for Apple iPhones, as well as a web-based SaaS platform offering that will facilitate the hiring of personnel, including project-based consultants, focusing initially on specialized technology talent. In the future, it expects that it will develop an app for Android mobile phones.
 
Immediately following the October 30, 2017 closing of the License, Mr. Michael J. Solomon, the founder and a then director of the Company (the “Founder”), exercised his Option, granted to him in September 2016, to purchase the Company’s subsidiary, Truli Media Corp (“TMC”) for $5,000. As a result, TMC is no longer a subsidiary of the Company. Prior to the exercise of the Option by the Founder to purchase TMC, the Company was focused on the on-demand media and social networking markets as an aggregator of family-friendly, faith-based Christian content, media, music and Internet Protocol Television programming. Upon entering into the License and selling TMC to the Founder, the Company exited the on-demand media and social networking business.
 
The operations of TMC are included in our consolidated financial statements through the date of the exercise of the Option by the Founder. In discussing the business of the Company, we refer to the business now operated by the Company and Vocaworks except as otherwise made clear from the context.
 
History
 
The Company was incorporated in Oklahoma on July 28, 2008. On June 13, 2012, the Company acquired Truli Media Group, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company (“TLLC”). Under the terms of the reorganization agreement, all of TLLC’s membership interests were exchanged for shares of approximately 74% of the fully diluted issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. Prior to this reverse merger, the Company was a publicly-traded corporation with nominal operations. On March 17, 2015, Truli reincorporated in Delaware.
 
On September 21, 2016, the Founder sold a convertible note with a principal amount of $1,955,934 representing loans to the Company made by the Founder (the “Convertible Notes”) to two institutional investors (the “Investors”) in equal amounts in exchange for payment of $102,500 from each investor.
 
Concurrent with the sale of the Convertible Notes to the Investors, the Founder and an affiliate sold their controlling block of common stock to the Company’s then new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Elliot Maza, for $6,000. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in order to simplify accounting and the potential exercise of the Option to acquire the Company’s current operating assets, the Company formed TMC as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and thereafter the Company transferred its operating assets to TMC and the Founder assumed the operating liabilities other than the Convertible Notes and public company liabilities.

Under the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement (the “NPA”), the Founder was required to pay all of the liabilities as of the date of the NPA other than the Convertible Note and public company expenses for one year and continue to pay all operating liabilities other than the public company liabilities, which were paid by the Investors. The NPA included a provision under which the Founder had an Option to purchase all of the Company’s current operating assets for $5,000 through September 23, 2017. Effective as of September 23, 2017, the Company agreed to extend the Option held by the Founder through October 31, 2017. On October 30, 2017, immediately following the sale of the License as defined, the Founder exercised the Option and acquired TMC.


On October 30, 2017, the Company entered into the License under which Recruiter granted the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, VocaWorks, the License to use Recruiter’s proprietary software and related intellectual property. In consideration for the License, the Company issued Recruiter 125,000,000 shares of its common stock. In addition, the Company created Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B”) which is convertible into common stock at $0.005 per share, subject to adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and reverse splits. The Company agreed to issue Recruiter 625,000 shares of the Series B upon the launch of a functional software platform and receipt of $10,000 in sales revenue. Recruiter is entitled to receive an additional 1,250,000 shares of Series B on the achievement of certain milestones as provided in the License. The Chief Executive Officer of Recruiter was appointed Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company in conjunction with entry into the License.
 
Immediately following the Company entering into the License and the change of control stemming from the issuance of 125,000,000 shares of common stock to Recruiter, the Company sold $600,000 of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A”) and Warrants to the Investors. On October 30, 2017, the Investors exchanged the Convertible Notes for shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series C”) and other convertible notes for Series C-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series C-1”).
 
Business Strategy
 
The Company is developing a software and mobile based platform and business under the “VocaWorks” brand name and moving into the rapidly expanding field of online and mobile-enabled staffing and talent acquisition solutions, facilitated in part through its entry into the License. VocaWorks will initially offer a native mobile iOS app solution, as well as a web-based SaaS platform offering and will facilitate the hiring of personnel, including project-based consultants, focusing initially on specialized technology talent for tech projects. On June 12, 2018, we announced the alpha launch of our software platform. The VocaWorks platform is an on-demand, cloud and mobile-based platform. Its key differentiator is its ability to source candidates directly from educational partners. Its initial focus will be a number of industries in the New York City market. 
 
Truli has not generated any revenue from its former or new business strategy and there can be no assurances that we will do so in the future.
 
Competition
 
VocaWorks faces significant competition from other recruitment technology companies, career sites, search engines, and social networking sites. Many of these technology competitors are well-funded private companies and large publicly-traded staffing related entities with greater marketing and technology resources available to them. Our competitors include many companies that have invested heavily in online and other forms of advertisements, resulting in strong, well-known name brands. Several of our competitors offer an integrated variety of hiring solutions, technologies, online systems, and online solutions. In addition, we compete indirectly with high traffic social networking sites and search engines that allow for job discovery and recruitment advertising.
Intellectual Property
 
Our primary intellectual property consists of the License to use Recruiter’s proprietary software and related intellectual property including certain of Recruiter’s trademarks and our trade secrets. Additionally, the Company owns software developed by the Company in connection with the Vocaworks platform and brand assets and associated trademarks to the Vocaworks platform.

Marketing
 
Due to our current lack of capital, we currently market in a very limited capacity, primarily through press releases, social media, and through the development of online content. In the event that we are able to access capital in the future, we would create robust advertising and marketing campaigns driven through online channels, such as available through major search engines and social media sites. We would look to also drive physical marketing such as display and other media in our key target market cities, and engage in influencer campaigns.
Plan of Operation
 
The key goal is to recruit employees and candidates for our alpha software platform and fine tune it so we can develop a beta version. The Company intends to continue to build and market the VocaWorks technology platform as Truli’s major operating entity, attempt to position the Company for success, and evaluate any and all business opportunities and options. It is the opinion of management that the Company has sufficient resources to complete the development of its web and mobile platforms, but the Company may lack sufficient resources to bring the service to market successfully through the proper sales and marketing efforts. Management may seek additional capital in order to finance the continued operation of its business.
Research and Development
 
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 we paid $57,500 for Software Development Services. Our Software Development Services were related to the development and alpha launch of the Vocaworks platform.
Employees
 
As of June 8, 2018, we have two full-time employees and one part-time employee who work for VocaWorks.
