     ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
     Overview
     Since its founding in 1952, Nabors has grown from a small land drilling business in Canada to one of the world’s largest drilling contractors. Today, Nabors owns and operates one of the world’s largest land-based drilling rig fleets and is a provider of offshore rigs in the United States and numerous international markets. Nabors also provides directional drilling services, performance tools, and innovative technologies for its own rig fleet and those of third parties. In today’s performance-driven environment, we believe we are well positioned to seamlessly integrate downhole hardware, surface equipment and software solutions into our AC rig designs. Leveraging our advanced drilling automation capabilities, Nabors’ highly skilled workforce continues to set new standards for operational excellence and transform our industry.
     Our business is comprised of our global land-based and offshore drilling rig operations and other rig related services and technologies, consisting of equipment manufacturing, rig instrumentation and optimization software. We also specialize in wellbore placement solutions and are a leading provider of directional drilling and measurement while drilling (“MWD”) systems and services. 
     On December 1, 2017, Nabors announced the commencement of operations of Saudi Aramco Nabors Drilling Company (“SANAD”), a 50/50 joint venture between Saudi Arabian Oil Company (“Saudi Aramco”) and Nabors. SANAD owns, manages and operates onshore drilling rigs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
     On December 15, 2017, Nabors completed the acquisition of Tesco Corporation (“Tesco”). Tesco’s tubular services business will benefit our new Drilling Solutions segment (see below) as we expand globally into key regions. The acquisition had the additional benefit of combining Tesco’s rig equipment manufacturing, rental and aftermarket service business with our Rig Technologies segment, creating a leading rig equipment and drilling automation provider. Under the terms of the acquisition, Nabors acquired all common shares of Tesco in an all-stock transaction, with Tesco shareholders receiving 0.68 common shares of Nabors for each Tesco share owned, or approximately 32.1 million Nabors common shares.
     During the fourth quarter of 2017, we effected a change in the reporting of our segments to better reflect our product offerings and the growing significance of our Nabors’ Drilling Solutions business.  The expansion of our tubular

services offering attributable to the acquisition of Tesco during the fourth quarter, along with management’s increasing focus on the strategic aspect of this business and expectation of future growth, culminated in the decision to break this operation out into its own segment called Drilling Solutions.  This operation was historically included within our Rig Services segment, which we have renamed Rig Technologies and now primarily reflects the oilfield equipment manufacturing, rental and aftermarket service business of Canrig Drilling Technology (“Canrig”). Our segment information has been revised to conform to the new reportable segments.  Our business now consists of five reportable segments:  U.S., Canada, International, Drilling Solutions and Rig Technologies. 
     As a global provider of drilling and drilling-related services for land-based and offshore oil and natural gas wells, our fleet of rigs and drilling-related equipment as of December 31, 2017 includes:
    
· | 407 actively marketed rigs for land-based drilling operations in the United States, Canada and approximately 20 other countries throughout the world; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 38 actively marketed rigs for offshore drilling operations in the United States and multiple international markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The following table presents our average rigs working (a measure of activity and utilization over the year) and average utilization for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:
    
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 
 | Average | Average | Average | Average | Average | Average 
 | Rigs Working | Utilization | Rigs Working | Utilization | Rigs Working | Utilization
U.S. | 100.8 | 42% | 62.0 | 24% | 120.0 | 41% 
Canada | 15.4 | 30% | 9.7 | 14% | 16.7 | 25% 
International | 91.1 | 57% | 100.2 | 62% | 124.0 | 79% 
 | 207.3 | 46% | 171.9 | 35% | 260.7 | 50% 

      Average rigs working represents a measure of the number of equivalent rigs operating during a given period. For example, one rig operating 182.5 days during a 365-day period represents 0.5 average rigs working. International average rigs working includes our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates.
     Additional information regarding the geographic markets in which we operate and our business segments can be found in Note 21—Segment Information in Part II, Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
     U.S. Drilling
     Our U.S. Drilling operations include land drilling activities in the lower 48 states and Alaska as well as offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico. We operate one of the largest land-based drilling rig fleets in the United States, consisting of 192 AC rigs and 33 SCR rigs which were actively marketed as of December 31, 2017. 
     Nabors’ first AC land rig was built during 2002. Since then, the AC rig technology has significantly evolved as more than 900 AC rigs have been added to the U.S. land market. As the industry shifted to multi well pad drilling, operators demanded greater efficiencies and adaptability through batch drilling. We believe our latest generation of PACE® drilling rigs are ideal for batch drilling, with pad optimal features, such as our proprietary side saddle design, and advanced walking capabilities. 
     In 2013, we introduced our PACE®-X800 rig with an advanced walking system that enables the rig to move quickly over existing wells, along the X and Y axes. Most of the ancillary equipment moves with the rig, enabling it to move easily between adjacent rows of wells. Through December 31, 2017, we have placed a total of 47 PACE®-X800 rigs into service within the lower 48 market, including three rigs during fiscal year 2017. 
     During the second half of 2016, we introduced our new PACE®-M800 and PACE®-M1000 rigs which complement our existing PACE®-X800 rigs. The PACE®-M800 rig is designed for lower-density multi-well pads whereas the PACE®-M1000 is designed for higher density pads. Both are designed to move rapidly between pads. Featuring the same advanced walking capabilities as the PACE®-X800 rig, the PACE®-M800 rig can quickly move 

 
  5

 
efficiently on pads and over short distances, with minimal rig-up and rig-down components. Through December 31, 2017, we have placed eight PACE®-M800 rigs into service, including four rigs during fiscal year 2017.
     In addition to land drilling operations throughout the lower 48 states and Alaska, we also actively marketed 14 platform rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as of December 31, 2017. 
     Our U.S. drilling operations contributed approximately 31% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately 25% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
     Canada Drilling
     Our rig fleet consisted of 42 land-based drilling rigs in Canada as of December 31, 2017. Our Canada drilling operations contributed approximately 3% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately 2% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.     International Drilling
     We maintain a footprint in nearly every major oil and gas market across the globe, most notably in Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Argentina, Colombia, Kazakhstan and Venezuela. Many of our rigs in our international drilling markets were designed to address the challenges inherent in specific drilling locations such as those required in the desert and remote or environmentally sensitive locations, as well as the various shale plays. As of December 31, 2017, our international fleet consisted of 139 land-based drilling rigs in approximately 20 countries. We also actively marketed 17 platforms and seven jackup rigs in the international offshore drilling markets as of the same date. We continue to upgrade and deploy high-specification desert rigs specifically for gas drilling in the Middle East. We have been able to extend the utilization of the PACE®-X800 rigs in international markets by deploying six such rigs in Latin America. 
     During 2016, we entered into an agreement with Saudi Aramco, to form a new joint venture to own, manage and operate onshore drilling rigs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The joint venture, which is equally owned by Saudi Aramco and Nabors, commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2017. The joint venture leverages our established business in Saudi Arabia to begin operations, with a focus on Saudi Arabia's existing and future onshore oil and gas fields. 
     Our International drilling operations contributed approximately 58% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately 68% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.

      In addition, the acquisition of Tesco in December 2017 compliments our investment in Nabors Drilling Solutions and augments our drilling technology offering through enhanced tubular services. 
     Our Drilling Solutions operations contributed approximately 6% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately 3% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
     Rig Technologies
     Our Rig Technologies segment is primarily comprised of Canrig, which manufactures and sells top drives, catwalks, wrenches, drawworks and other drilling related equipment such as robotic systems and downhole tools which are installed on both onshore and offshore drilling rigs.  
     Our Rig Technologies operations contributed approximately 2% of our consolidated operating revenues, net of intercompany sales, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately 2% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
     Our Business Strategy
     Our business strategy is to build shareholder value and enhance our competitive position by:
    
· | achieving superior operational and health, safety and environmental performance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | leveraging our existing global infrastructure and operating reputation to capitalize on growth opportunities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | continuing to develop our existing portfolio of value-added services to our customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | enhancing our technology position and advancing drilling technology both on the rig and downhole; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | achieving returns above our cost of capital.
--+---------------------------------------------

      During 2017 we achieved several milestones in our drive to automate and integrate the well construction process. As the industry continues its recovery from the severe downturn that began in 2014, we believe the investments we have made in our rigs and related technology and equipment are all paying off. We are focused on drilling the most productive, efficient and safe wells to our clients’ specifications, engineered for highly complex and demanding geology.
     Our global fleet of 444 rigs is the fundamental platform for our business. We entered 2018 having nearly completed our goal of 100 Nabors SmartRig™ units for the U.S. Lower 48. Our new PACE®-M1000 rig was introduced in the second half of 2017, building on the PACE®-M800’s capabilities to deliver optimal well construction for ultra-long laterals with minimal time spent mobilizing between well pads. Additionally, our enhanced PACE®-X Quad design began operations for two different major customers in 2017. This innovative mast structure handles four stands of drill 

 
  7

 
pipe instead of three, decreasing the number of connections and saving time for the customer. Finally, the retrofitting of much of our non-PACE®-X, 1500 HP AC fleet to bolster capabilities for faster drilling, improved mobility and extended reach has boosted the number of super spec rigs in our fleet at a fraction of the cost of newbuilds.
     During 2017, we also made significant progress in expanding our drilling technology portfolio. We believe these actions position us well to address the changing market dynamic both in the United States and internationally. Our technological development efforts drive toward a seamless integration of the rig’s operations with downhole sensing. In addition, we are adding complementary services to our traditional rig offering and in many cases replacing third-party providers of these complementary services as a single service provider. We successfully built scale across wellbore placement, performance drilling tools, managed pressure drilling services, and other services in the Lower 48, and are now bringing these services to certain international markets. These efforts support our strategy to differentiate our drilling services, and ultimately reduce our customers’ unit costs through advanced drilling technology and value added enhancements.
     The acquisition of Tesco augmented both our drilling technology offering through enhanced tubular services, as well as our rig equipment portfolio. We believe the addition of the many skilled operating and manufacturing personnel to our team combined with our global rig platform will bolster our capabilities in 2018. We also took a major step forward toward our vision of a fully automated rig with the acquisition of Robotic Drilling Systems in September 2017. This exciting modular technology is applicable both in onshore and offshore markets, and provides additional opportunities to further develop Canrig’s global scale and customer base. 
     As oil prices improved in the second half of 2017, a healthier exploration and production industry has expanded its activity. We are well positioned to offer greater value than ever before. With our significantly enhanced global fleet, growing penetration of Nabors Drilling Solutions products and services, and development of next-generation rig equipment, we have positioned Nabors not just for the rig of the future, but for the future of well construction.  
     Drilling Contracts
     Our drilling contracts are typically daywork contracts. A daywork contract generally provides for a basic rate per day when drilling (the dayrate for providing a rig and crew) and for lower rates when the rig is moving between drilling locations, or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control. In addition, daywork contracts may provide for a lump-sum fee for the mobilization and demobilization of the rig, which in most cases approximates our anticipated costs. A daywork contract differs from a footage contract (in which the drilling contractor is paid on the basis of a rate per foot drilled) and a turnkey contract (in which the drilling contractor is paid for drilling a well to a specified depth for a fixed price).
     Our contracts for land-based and offshore drilling have durations that are single-well, multi-well or term. Term contracts generally have durations ranging from six months to five years. Under term contracts, our rigs are committed to one customer. Offshore workover projects are often contracted on a single-well basis. We generally receive drilling contracts through competitive bidding, although we occasionally enter into contracts by direct negotiation. Most of our single-well contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice, while multi-well contracts and term contracts may provide us with early termination compensation in certain circumstances. Such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances the customer may not be obligated, able or willing to make an early termination payment to us. Contract terms and rates differ depending on a variety of factors, including competitive conditions, the geographical area, the geological formation to be drilled, the equipment and services to be supplied, the on-site drilling conditions and the anticipated duration of the work to be performed. 
     Our Customers
     Our customers include major national and independent oil and gas companies. One customer, Saudi Aramco, accounted for approximately 29%, 33% and 12% of our consolidated operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which operating revenues are included in the results of our International drilling reportable segment. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily as a result of our acquisition of the remaining interest in Nabors Arabia Company Limited (“Nabors Arabia”), our prior joint venture in Saudi Arabia, in May 2015 and our consolidation of Nabors Arabia’s results of operations. Nabors Arabia was historically a joint venture in the Kingdom, but now is wholly-owned by Nabors. Our contracts with Saudi Aramco are on a per rig basis. As noted above, we have entered into a new joint venture with this customer.

     Our Employees
     As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 15,000 people in approximately 20 countries. Our number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services. Some rig-based employees in Alaska, Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela are represented by collective bargaining units. We believe our relationship with our employees is generally good.     Seasonality
     Our operations are subject to seasonal factors. Specifically, our drilling operations in Canada and Alaska generally experience reduced levels of activity and financial results during the second quarter of each year, due to the annual spring thaw. In addition, our U.S. offshore market can be impacted during summer months by tropical weather systems in the Gulf of Mexico. Global climate change could lengthen these periods of reduced activity, but we cannot currently estimate to what degree. Our overall financial results reflect the seasonal variations experienced in these operations, but seasonality does not materially impact the remaining portions of our business.     Research and Engineering
     Research and engineering continues to be an important part of our overall business. During 2017, we spent approximately $51.1 million on research and engineering activities compared to $33.6 million during 2016. The effective use of technology is critical to maintaining our competitive position within the drilling industry. We expect to continue developing technology internally and/or acquiring technology through strategic acquisitions.
     Industry/Competitive Conditions
     To a large degree, our businesses depend on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. The level of exploration, development and production activities is to a large extent tied to the prices of oil and natural gas, which can fluctuate significantly and are highly volatile. For example, oil prices were as high as $107 per barrel during 2014 and were as low as $26 per barrel in 2016.  Oil prices began to stabilize during 2017 to moderate levels at an average of approximately $54 per barrel, still well below the peak we experienced three years ago and the average price over the last decade. As experienced in 2015 and 2016, a decrease or prolonged decline in the price of oil or natural gas or in the exploration, development and production activities of our customers could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services and/or a reduction in dayrates and utilization, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors— Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability and Item 7.— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
     The markets in which we provide our services are highly competitive. We believe that competitive pricing is a significant factor in determining which service provider is awarded a job in these markets and customers are increasingly sensitive to pricing during periods of market instability. Historically, the number of available rigs and drilling-related equipment has exceeded demand in many of the markets in which we operate, resulting in strong price competition. This is due in part to the fact that most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in the levels of exploration, development and production activities and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas.
     Although many rigs can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and many of the total available contracts are currently awarded on a bid basis, competition has increased based on the supply of existing and new rigs across all of our markets. Most available contracts for our services are currently awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price.
     In addition to price, other competitive factors in the markets we serve are the overall quality of service and safety record, the technical specification and condition of equipment, the availability of skilled personnel and the ability to offer ancillary services. Our drilling business is subject to certain additional competitive factors. For example, we believe our ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features and, in certain international markets, our experience operating in certain environments and strong customer relationships have been significant factors in the selection of

Nabors for the provision of drilling services. We expect that the market for our drilling services will continue to be highly competitive. See Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors—We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
     Certain competitors are present in more than one of the markets in which we operate, although no one competitor operates in all such markets. We compete with (1) Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. and several other competitors with national, regional or local rig operations in the United States, (2) Saipem S.p.A, KCA Deutag, and Weatherford International Ltd. and various contractors in our international markets and (3) Precision Drilling, Ensign Energy Services, and others in Canada.
     Acquisitions and Divestitures
     We have grown from a land drilling business centered in the U.S. lower 48 states, Canada and Alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in most of the major oil and gas markets in the world. At the beginning of 1990, our fleet consisted of 44 actively marketed land drilling rigs in Canada, Alaska and in various international markets. Today, our worldwide fleet of actively marketed rigs consists of 407 land drilling rigs, 31 offshore platform rigs and seven jackup units. This growth was fueled in part by strategic acquisitions. While we continuously consider and review strategic opportunities, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions, there can be no assurance that such opportunities will continue to be available, that the pricing will be economical or that we will be successful in completing and realizing the expected benefits of such transactions in the future.
     We may sell a subsidiary or group of assets outside of our core markets or business if it is strategically or economically advantageous for us to do so.
     On March 24, 2015, we completed the merger of our Completion & Production Services business with C&J Energy Services, Inc. (“C&J Energy”). In the merger and related transactions, our wholly-owned interest in our Completion & Production Services business was exchanged for cash and an equity interest in the combined entity, C&J Energy Services Ltd. (“CJES”). Prior to the merger, our Completion & Production Services business conducted our operations involved in the completion, life-of-well maintenance and plugging and abandonment of wells in the United States and Canada. On July 20, 2016, CJES and certain of its subsidiaries commenced voluntarily cases under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and as a result, we no longer hold a meaningful stake in CJES. For more information on the accounting for our investment in CJES, see Note 9—Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates in Part II, Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
     In addition, we undertook the following strategic transactions over the last three years.
     In May 2015, we paid $106.0 million in cash to acquire the remaining 49% equity interest in Nabors Arabia, our prior joint venture in Saudi Arabia, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. Previously, we held a 51% equity interest with a carrying value of $44.7 million, and we had accounted for the joint venture as an equity method investment. The acquisition of the remaining interest allows us to strategically align our future growth in this market by providing additional flexibility to invest capital and pursue future investment opportunities. As a result, we consolidated the assets and liabilities of Nabors Arabia on the acquisition date based on their respective fair values. We have also consolidated the operating results of Nabors Arabia since the acquisition date and reported those results in our International drilling segment. 
     During 2016, we entered into an agreement with Saudi Aramco, to form a new joint venture to own, manage and operate onshore drilling rigs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The joint venture, which is equally owned by Saudi Aramco and Nabors, commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2017. The joint venture leverages our established business in Saudi Arabia to begin operations, with a focus on Saudi Arabia's existing and future onshore oil and gas fields.
     In September 2017 we paid an initial amount of approximately $50.7 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, to acquire Robotic Drilling Systems AS (“RDS”), a provider of automated tubular and tool handling equipment for the onshore and offshore drilling markets based in Stavanger, Norway. This transaction will allow us to integrate RDS’s highly capable team and product offering with the technology portfolio of Canrig, and strengthens the development of Canrig’s drilling automation solutions.

     In December 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Tesco in an all-stock transaction. Tesco shareholders received 0.68 common shares of Nabors for each Tesco share owned, or approximately 32.1 million Nabors common shares. The combination of Tesco with Nabors’ current product offerings strengthens our ability to accelerate and scale deployment in drilling automation and analytics.
     Environmental Compliance
     We do not anticipate that compliance with currently applicable environmental rules and regulations and controls will significantly change our competitive position, capital spending or earnings during 2018. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental rules and regulations and that the cost of such compliance is not material to our business or financial condition. For a more detailed description of the environmental rules and regulations applicable to our operations, see Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Changes to or noncompliance with governmental laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.
