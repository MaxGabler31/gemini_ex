Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview 
 
We design, manufacture and sell direct current, or DC, power systems for applications primarily in the telecommunications market and, to a lesser extent, in other markets, including military, electric vehicle charging, cogeneration, distributed power and uninterruptable power supply. Within the telecommunications market, our systems provide reliable and low-cost energy for applications that do not have access to the utility grid or have critical power needs and cannot be without power in the event of utility grid failure. Within this market, we offer three configurations of our DC power systems, with output power ranging from 5 kW to 20 kW and with three possible sources of fuel: diesel, natural gas and liquid petroleum gas.
 
Our DC base power systems integrate our DC generator with automated controls that are programmed to efficiently charge various battery chemistries to provide backup energy during a power failure. In addition, these systems are also used to provide prime power in off-grid and bad-grid locations in telecommunications towers. Substantially all of our net sales are derived from sales of our DC base power systems to Tier-1 wireless telecommunications tower companies in the U.S.
 
Our DC hybrid power systems combine our DC base power systems with lithium-ion batteries (or other advanced battery chemistries) to efficiently store energy from DC generator or grid systems to provide back-up power or prime power. Our DC hybrid power system replaces lead acid systems with longer-life and higher efficiency lithium-ion batteries equipped with our proprietary battery management system, or BMS, which protects batteries from being over charged or over discharged during daily use.
 
Our DC solar hybrid power systems combine our DC hybrid power system with solar panels to produce and store lower cost energy generated by the solar panels into lithium batteries, thereby reducing a DC generator’s run time and operating costs.
 
Recent Events
 
In August 2017, we provided test and demonstration units to a large U.S. Tier-1 wireless provider. In March 2018, we received notice from the wireless provider of the successful completion of testing and we subsequently began negotiating commercial terms and conditions to provide DC backup power systems throughout U.S. territories. To the extent we are successful in completing these negotiations, we will be an authorized supplier of DC power systems to all of the top four Tier-1 wireless providers in the U.S., which was one of our key strategic initiatives.
 
In March 2018, we received Phase II approval and purchase orders for twenty light-weight mobile DC power systems for use in the U.S. Army Robotic Mule project. This project is part of a global military initiative to remotely provide surveillance, transportation and reconnaissance over wide areas, thereby improving survivability and reaction times in the battlefield.
 
In March 2018, we received a purchase order to design and deliver a compact trailer-mounted DC power system and lithium battery pack to deliver backup power during natural disasters and other emergencies. The finished product will be tested and evaluated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). We expect that upon successful testing and evaluation we will obtain additional commercial purchase orders.
 
In 2017, we began shipments of DC power systems to a large U.S. Tier-1 wireless provider. During the year our shipments to this customer steadily grew to 45% of our net sales, resulting in the wireless provider becoming one of our largest customers. In February 2018, we reached a three-year long-term commercial agreement with this wireless provider that outlines product needs, establishes training, aftermarket support and communication protocols to expand installations of DC backup systems nationwide.

Our efforts during the second half of 2017 in the international markets has resulted in the successful completion of the testing and evaluation phase of our DC hybrid system at a remote telecommunications facility in Southeast Asia. We are currently negotiating purchase terms and conditions with the wireless provider to add DC hybrid systems as a backup power source to telecommunications towers located in these remote regions of Southeast Asia. In addition, during the same period we received notification of being selected as a provider of DC hybrid power systems to a wireless telecommunication customer in Africa.
 
Historical Background
 
We began operations in 1979, and in 1980 we released our first product, a solar powered vaccine refrigerator/freezer for use in remote areas worldwide. This product was developed in support of a World Health Organization initiative and the U.S. Agency for International Development and was administered by the NASA Lewis Research Center. Since then, we have continued to expand our capabilities and product lines within the solar and renewable energy industries.
 
In 1984, we designed and manufactured test carts for Hughes Aircraft Company that provided cooling systems for testing F-14 radar assemblies. During the same period, we also supplied defense contractor, Martin Marietta, with computerized environmental control units for testing laser guided missile launch systems and a cooling system for a Phalanx Gun system to General Dynamics.
 
During most of the 1980s, we generated a majority of our revenues through development contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and major defense companies for the design of DC power generator and cooling systems. We retain design rights on all of our engineering and product development contracts.
 
In 1991, we began commercialization of technologies originally pioneered by these military contracts, which led to the development of proprietary permanent magnet alternator and related power electronics that encompasses a DC power system. During that period, we also manufactured solar powered refrigerators used by United Nations foreign aid agencies to store and preserve vaccines in field-operated medical care centers.
 
During the 1990s, we developed and commercialized an advanced Permanent Magnet Homopolar Hybrid, or PMHH, DC alternator that is lighter and more efficient than a conventional AC alternator. Over the ensuing years, our generators and controls were extensively field tested in a variety of military applications. Our PMHH DC alternator technology was used as an auxiliary power source in military vehicles and as a prime power generator for military missions in the field. During this time, we also engineered, manufactured and sold DC power systems for various other applications including oil and gas fields, rural homes and farms and telecommunications. We also generated revenues by providing short-run production, prototyping and design services to develop energy efficient DC power systems for customers within the military, renewable energy and telecommunications markets.
 
With the significant growth of the telecommunications market in the 1990s, we elected to transition from manufacturing products primarily for military applications to the commercialization of these products for the telecommunications market. We were one of the first companies to introduce high efficiency, light weight, compact DC power systems to this market.
 
In 2005, we developed and manufactured a computerized ground support unit for Martin Marietta that was used in the U-2 aircraft and in the Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial Vehicle programs. During the same year, we developed our low-cost, higher efficiency 8000 Series DC alternators and our fully integrated next generation Supra Controller™ Series power control system which is designed to integrate and monitor engine controls, power controls and battery management system into a single integrated system.
 
From 2006 to 2011, we introduced our next generation of 8000 Series DC alternators with higher power output and efficiency and lower production costs with remote monitoring and controls. During this period, we obtained UL 2200 listing for our DC generators and introduced lithium-ion battery hybrid systems with our proprietary battery management system, or BMS.
 
In 2008, we began demonstrating our DC power systems to telecommunications companies in an effort to supply DC power for the radio equipment located at a wireless cell tower sites as backup power in case of power outages. In 2013, after four years of extensive field testing, we received approval from Verizon Wireless to market our DC power systems to its regional facilities throughout the U.S.

In 2011, we introduced DC hybrid power systems designed for off-grid remote applications. These systems integrated our DC power systems with solar panels, lithium-ion batteries assembled into an outdoor shipping container with capability to remotely operate the wireless site for weeks at a time. During the 2013 and 2014, we shipped $1.7 million of our DC hybrid power systems, to two of the largest wireless telecommunications providers in Australia.
 
In 2015, due to a significant growth in sales, we moved our production facility to Gardena, CA expanding our production capacity by over 400%. A significant portion of our growth was a result of Verizon Wireless’s national campaign to add backup generators to cellular sites located in inner cities and remote locations with bad grid conditions.
 
In 2016, our sales peaked at $22.8 million, with 95% of these sales to Verizon Wireless. In 2016, due to the increased product demand, we decided to raise equity capital to fund inventory growth and other working capital needs. In December 2016, we successfully closed our initial public offering of 2,400,000 shares of our common stock with net proceeds of $17 million.
 
In 2017, we expanded our sales and service infrastructure to diversify our customer base globally. We established regional sales offices in South Africa, U.A.E., Singapore, Poland and the Dominican Republic and established sales and service locations in Australia and Romania to locally manage the Southeast Asia and EMEA regions respectively.
 
In the U.S., we are an approved supplier to all of the four top Tier 1 wireless providers. During 2017, we generated revenues from the top two Tier-1 wireless providers and are currently providing products to three of the top four Tier 1 wireless providers.
    Markets
 
We operate primarily within the telecommunications market and, to a lesser extent, in other markets including military, electrical vehicle charging, cogeneration, distributed power and uninterruptable power supply.
Telecommunications
 
We believe that investments in wireless telecommunications infrastructure is on the rise globally due to rising data usage and increased pressure to reduce costs requiring providers to improve operational efficiencies while expanding coverage of networks into remote or rural areas. Increased reliance on wireless networks is also resulting in increased demand for reliability of these systems resulting in higher demand for power backup systems. We believe that some of the key aspects fueling the growth of telecommunications operators include:

· | improved operational efficiency of telecommunications towers, with an emphasis on reducing power consumption and power generation costs; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increased need for communications during natural and man-made disasters has resulted in strengthening of telecom infrastructure;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increased active user base through the expansion of networks in remote or rural areas in developing nations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increased densification and data transfer speeds that increase the usage of additional services like internet and video on smart mobile devices. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The backup power generations market for cell towers can be segmented into the following two areas:
 

· | Tower Upgrades. The legacy power generation equipment at cell towers mainly consist of AC generators. Replacement costs of an AC generator is lower than a comparable DC system. In addition, the integration cost of a new AC generator to existing legacy equipment at a site is also lower than a DC generator system, which may require replacement of additional ancillary equipment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | New Installations. In new installations, where an entirely new site is being constructed for expansion or operational efficiency reasons, the standalone DC power system cost is lower than a comparable AC system, including its ancillary components. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In order to improve wireless tower efficiency, service providers are divesting these fixed assets to more agile regional tower operators while simultaneously requiring an upgrade of the technologies to maintain operating cost efficiencies. These upgrades from old legacy switch-mode rectifier technology to digital rectifiers has led to lower heat generation thereby providing an opportunity for outdoor installations for both off-grid and on-grid applications. Increased new construction of these outdoor tower facilities has provided us with the ability to market higher-efficiency DC power systems to these tower operators globally.
 
Telecommunications providers and tower operators have invested significant capital in upgrading their current infrastructure from legacy switch-mode rectifier technology to digital rectifiers to increase power conversion efficiency. Current rectifier technology that is being installed at telecommunications sites has a power conversion efficiency of 96%, as compared to 70% for older rectifier technology, significantly reducing the heat generated and the need for air conditioning. In addition, these and other technological improvements have allowed telecommunications providers to install outdoor cell sites with no air conditioners and, in some cases, powering them with generators and renewable energy systems, such as solar. This trend towards using outdoor cell sites and removing air conditioners has provided telecommunications providers and tower operators with the opportunity to use DC power systems as a backup or primary source of power, since all base radios, antennas and batteries located at cell sites use DC power.
 
Military
 
The rapid deployment and improved fuel efficiency of mobile electric power is a key component of military combat operations.
 
Food, communications and weapon systems are the lifeblood of a military unit. With few exceptions, military communications operate from 28 volts DC or 48 volts DC sources. Currently, many guns (including howitzers), cannons and motors use computers and require DC power. We believe that the demand for DC power with the military is increasing as the use of pulsed energy weapon systems (i.e., weapons that either use pulses of electricity to fire ammunition or operate by sending an electric current to a target) are more widely used on the battle field. This increased use of electronics in military missions has resulted in an increased need for DC power and for more efficient ways of generating, storing and distributing energy. The military has assigned a special program management department to oversee the development and standardization of a new range of higher efficiency mobile power generators ranging in size from 5 kW to 200 kW. With pulsed weapon systems, DC power requirements can climb as high as 6 megawatts.
 
The objectives of the creation of a new generation of power generators are:
 

· | enhanced mobility, reliability and maintainability;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | improved fuel efficiency;
--+--------------------------


· | reduced system size and weight;
--+--------------------------------


· | reduced infrared and acoustic signatures;
--+------------------------------------------


· | increased survivability in rugged combat operations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------

· | reduced total cost of ownership.
--+---------------------------------

 
Once the Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources, or the AMMPS, the U.S. Department of Defense’s third generation of military power generators, is fully implemented in vehicles and stationary platforms, it is expected that the new generators will save over 50 million gallons of fuel per year, according to the Mobile Electric Power Systems Command Brief issued by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2009. The new generation of mobile electric power generators will also have the capability to connect together to form an efficient power distribution center to create “power islands” that serve both DC and AC loads. In addition, solar and wind power is being added to AMMPS to create hybrid systems that can function as self-sustaining power sources in remote areas. The next generation of power systems are required to provide 21% higher fuel efficiency, reduce noise and weight and be capable of performing in extreme environments. Our DC hybrid power systems, with integrated controls that manage energy produced by solar and lithium battery solutions, provide higher fuel efficiency than traditional fossil fuel powered power systems currently used by the military. We believe our complete line of commercialized DC hybrid power systems in use for the past decade provides us with a competitive advantage in meeting stated power system goals outlined by Department of Defense.
 
 Improvements in sensors, navigation and communication technologies have led to increased integration of situational awareness systems that allow all combat assets to communicate and coordinate both defensive and offensive efforts in combat. Reliance on these systems has led to an effort to integrate DC auxiliary power units ranging in size from 3 kW to 20 kW onboard combat vehicles independent of engine driven alternators. Integration of auxiliary power units to run climate control and on-board electronics while idling saves a significant amount of fuel and maintenance, a critical asset during combat operations. We believe that the integration of smaller horsepower auxiliary power units to operate climate control and on-board electronics systems, rather than large horsepower vehicle engines while idling, may save a significant amount of fuel and maintenance, both of which are critical assets during combat operations.
 
During the past two decades, we have shipped 2 kW and 30 kW advanced power units, comprised of hybrid vehicle power systems, auxiliary power systems and prime power systems, to the U.S. Department of Defense and to its prime contractors for a wide variety of missions covering the land, sea and air. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, sales of auxiliary power systems designed for use in military combat vehicles represented 1.3% and 1.3%, respectively, of our net sales.
 
Uninterruptable Power Supplies and Data Centers
 
The convergence of voice and data networks and increased reliance on digital networks combined with the unprecedented demand on power grids are resulting in an increase in the global need for backup power.
 
Uninterruptable power supply systems are used in a variety of application including homes, offices, banks and hotels. Batteries are coupled with an inverter/charger to continue to provide power during loss of the utility grid. Other applications include security systems, medical devices, computers and data services.
 
In most industrial and commercial applications, uninterruptable power supply battery systems are used to temporarily provide base load for a short duration of time, until backup industrial generators are capable of providing the base load. The power ratings of backup generators for commercial and industrial uninterruptable power supply applications can vary from 5 kW to 200 kW. We began shipping 6 kW DC hybrid systems for outdoor backup applications in 1993.
 
The challenges with current technologies with uninterruptable power supply systems center around current battery performance, poor reliability and service life, high cost and maintenance. During 2014 and 2015, we developed back-up power systems for telecommunications customers that integrated our DC power systems with super-capacitors as storage devices, thereby eliminating the use of battery banks as storage devices in certain backup applications. We believe our solution provides higher reliability and longer life than a battery-powered backup system in on-grid and bad-grid applications. We plan to further develop 5kW to 200 kW configurations of our backup DC hybrid power system products for telecommunications and data center applications. We did not sell any of these products during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Our Competitive Strengths 
 
We have over a 30-year history and have developed a reputation as a proven supplier of reliable and advanced proprietary technology products to customers within the telecommunications, military, industrial and marine markets. We have invested significant capital and engineering expertise to develop products that capitalize on the growing trend towards environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient power generation systems. We further believe our success will be based on the following key competitive strengths:

· | Proprietary Technologies. Our decades of research and development efforts has led to the integration of high-efficiency DC alternator technology integrated with conventional engines to provide highly reliable backup power solutions for telecommunications towers. During the last decade, we invested significant capital in the development of charge control algorithms that allow our DC power generators to safely charge various types of battery chemistries. This feature combined with our ability to remotely monitor our DC generator gives our customers higher field reliability and uptime when compared to conventional AC generators. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Engineering Expertise. During 2017, we invested significant capital in expanding our field sales staff globally. Our direct sales model, where our engineers and sales personnel jointly assess customer needs and design customized solutions, has resulted in some early success with the top three Tier-1 wireless providers in the U.S. We believe our higher level of customization reduces the size and weight of a DC power system, reduces fuel consumption and maintenance and provides greater reliability and a longer life, all at a lower cost to the end-user. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Manufacturing Competitiveness. We believe that our vertical integration approach to manufacturing lowers our production costs and improves our overall operational efficiency. In addition, vertically integrated manufacturing of our proprietary technologies such as DC alternators, charge controls and battery management systems, provides us with a greater control and protection over our intellectual property. We believe our modular approach to manufacturing provides us with the lowest manufacturing costs for our proprietary technologies while giving us the ability to deliver customized solutions to our Tier-1 wireless provider customers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong Customer Base. Substantially all of our net sales are derived from sales of our DC base power systems to wireless telecommunication providers in the U.S. In 2017, we substantially expanded our sales and service infrastructure on a global basis resulting in the addition of two new Tier-1 wireless provider customers in U.S. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Experienced Management Team. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and key engineers each have over 25 years of engineering and production experience in the design and manufacturing of power systems. Our engineers have equipment design experience, as well as hands-on skills to build prototypes. A key factor demonstrating management’s abilities and our engineering aptitude is our successful track record over the last 25 years of executing fixed-cost research, design and engineering contracts, with an average of eight projects per year.

Business Strategy
 
We believe the growth in wireless telecommunications infrastructure in the U.S. and international markets has led to a rapid rise in the need for DC backup power systems. With our 30 years of experience and reputation within the DC power systems market, we are working to increase awareness, availability and affordability of more efficient DC-based products as a backup power and charging source within the telecommunications industry. Because of the increased reliance on wireless networks during emergencies and natural disasters, existing and new wireless installations are being upgraded to provide reliable operations during time of emergency. The primary elements of our business strategy include:

· | Further develop U.S. mobile telecommunications market. During 2017, we invested significant capital into our sales and marketing efforts to demonstrate our DC power systems to the top four Tier-1 wireless providers in the U.S. In February 2018, we entered into an agreement with a large Tier-1 wireless provider, which represented approximately 45% of our total sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. This agreement outlines delivery payment, pricing and warranty terms during the term of the agreement. In addition, we are in final negotiations with another Tier-1 wireless provider to provide DC power backup systems on a nationwide basis. We believe increased demand to equip cellular tower sites with backup equipment combined with our ability to compete on an economic basis with AC power systems at large volumes, will result in a significant transition of the marketplace from AC power systems to DC power systems. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand global sales to bad-grid or off-grid markets. The increase in subscriber base in rural and remote areas in developing countries has increased the deployment of telecommunication sites in off-grid and bad-grid areas. Given that 98% of our sales of our DC power systems are to U.S. customers, which we believe represents only 4.7% of the total global telecommunications market, we believe a significant opportunity exists for sales of our DC power systems to customers located in developing nations, such as Southeast Asia, Australia and Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2017, we established regional sales offices in South Africa, U.A.E., Singapore, Poland and Dominican Republic and established sales and service locations in Australia and Romania to locally manage the Southeast Asia and EMEA regions respectively. We are also actively pursuing strategic partnerships with established mobile telecommunications tower service companies located in Latin America, and Eastern Europe.

· | Develop higher power DC power systems. We are in the process of developing higher power DC power systems that will include solar hybrid systems for prime and backup power. We believe that higher power DC power systems will provide us with an opportunity to increase our product offerings within the data center and telecommunications markets. We plan to enhance and further develop our existing proprietary alternator and control technologies to increase power output capacity up to 200 kW. In addition, higher capacity DC power systems will address the backup power needs of large regional data centers and can be used for backup or peak load sharing applications in large renewable energy installations, such as large solar or wind farms. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand renewable solar energy product offerings. We believe that increased environmental regulations combined with the declining cost of solar and advanced storage batteries has accelerated the shift of the telecommunications tower operators towards solar hybrid systems in off-grid and bad-grid regions worldwide. In 2013, we delivered twenty solar hybrid renewable energy DC power systems to the largest mobile telecommunications provider in Australia for installation in remote mobile tower application. We plan to expand our DC solar hybrid power system product line to address off-grid and bad-grid applications in telecommunications and military markets worldwide. Our expanded product line will be comprised of systems ranging from 10 kW to 200 kW that will be available in either low voltage or high voltage configurations and designed for outdoor installations. We plan to target power markets in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa where local governments are incentivizing the use of renewable energy within the telecommunications industry through favored spectrum auctions and tax incentives. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Technologies
    In 1991, we began introducing DC power systems to provide backup and prime power for off-grid and bad-grid applications. Our initial products were predominantly designed for military applications and used as auxiliary power for vehicles, tanks and radar sites. In the late 1990s, we introduced our DC power systems for commercial applications like mobile telecommunications towers, solar refrigerators and oil field applications.
 
In 1992, we developed our own proprietary DC alternator to improve system efficiency, reduce costs and lower weight. Our design replaced a conventional 4-pole, three-phase designs with a light weight, low cost 12-pole and 32-pole designs (i.e., designs containing 12 or 36 magnetic poles) incorporating either 6 or 3 phases (i.e., containing 6 or 3 power circuits). Another unique aspect of the design of our DC alternators is the elimination of bearings, internal wiring connections, and an exciter (i.e., a device which supplies the magnetizing current to generate working flux) to provide a longer life cycle than conventional motor designs in the marketplace.

In 2002, we introduced our 6200 PMHH alternator, which combines the attributes of homopolar alternator technology with a permanent magnet. When mounted on an engine and operated at either a fixed or variable speed, the model 6200 PMHH generates a precise amount of regulated voltage and current. The DC output can then be used to power electronics or charge batteries.
 
In 2006, we introduced our next generation 8000 Series alternators designed for higher power and voltage applications, which features our proprietary 32-pole permanent magnet alternator technology. The 8000 Series offers high efficiency at a lower cost while integrating our proprietary digital control system, Supra Controller™, that manages and optimizes alternator output. Our Supra Controller™ networks all components via CAN bus communications and software and has the ability to control, analyze, monitor, record and communicate all key system parameters to ensure efficiency, safety and reliability of the overall system. The ability to remotely monitor and calibrate each system parameter, receive system alarms and auto-reset the system when a fault is corrected are the key differentiating factors of our DC power systems.
 
In telecommunications tower backup applications, backup generators are used to provide power during grid outages or to charge batteries to provide longer run times during emergencies. Due to battery costs and availability issues, many telecommunications providers are known to use various types of chemistries or capacities as storage sources. During the past decade, we have successfully integrated various battery chemistry charge algorithms into our Supra Controller™ software.
 
In 2011, we added charge algorithms for various lithium battery chemistries and integrated our proprietary BMS with our Supra Controller™ software. In 2013, we further expanded the integration of storage and renewable energy such as solar and wind into our Supra Controller™ software resulting in the shipment of twenty off-grid telecom tower power systems to Australia.
 
In 2017, we demonstrated our DC hybrid power systems to telecommunications providers in Southeast Asia and Africa. We believe that the integration of renewable energy and storage batteries are ideal for off-grid remote locations in rural areas worldwide. During 2018, we plan to continue our research and development efforts to further enhance these integrations for remote telecom towers in Southeast Asia and Africa.
 
Products and Services
 
We broadly classify our power systems into three categories:
 

· | DC base power systems. Our basic system which is centered around a DC generator. Applications include both prime power and backup power. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | DC hybrid power systems. Our basic DC power system with added energy storage via lithium-ion or other battery chemistries.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | DC Solar hybrid power systems. Our DC hybrid power system with added renewable energy (i.e., solar panels).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DC Base Power Systems
 
Our DC base power systems are designed for use in prime power and backup power applications. All of our DC power systems are designed to last 20 years or more in backup applications and meet all UL2200 standards. To maximize operational life, we incorporate (over and above our competition) the following:

· | all aluminum, powder coated, enclosure with stainless hardware, which is lightweight and corrosion resistant;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 105 C rated signal wire, tinned copper strands;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | stainless steel braided covering hoses for fuel and coolant lines;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Class 220 C magnet wire for alternator windings;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | watertight connectors in place of terminal strips and other non-sealed connectors; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our Supra Controller™ modules that are environmentally sealed.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that the number one reliability issue with a generator set is the failure to start. To improve the reliability of our generators, we remove the engine’s starting battery and replace it with a super capacitor. The super capacitor has a 15- to 20-year service life, greater cold cranking amps and withstands greater temperature extremes than conventional starting batteries.
 
To reduce maintenance and help ensure that there is always adequate oil, we increase the engine’s oil capacity to provide for a 3,000-hour (natural gas / propane) or 1,500-hour (diesel) maintenance interval. Standard oil intervals for typical generators range from 200 to 500 hours.
 
DC Hybrid Power Systems
 
In most off-grid or bad-grid outdoor applications where DC loads are required, such as telecommunications towers in rural or remote areas, fuel costs of operating a generator can account for more than 60% of the total operating costs.
 
In most backup applications, such as telecommunications and uninterruptable power supply systems, lead acid batteries are used for providing transitional power while the generator starts up. In most of our prime power applications (including telecommunications) the goal is to reduce maintenance and fuel costs. Our Supra Controller™ automatically cycles the generator off when the loads are small and cycles it on again when the load increases or the battery charge is depleted. This cycling reduces engine maintenance and saves significant quantities of fuel.
 
Additional fuel savings are realized by using lithium-ion batteries in place of lead acid batteries. Lead acid batteries, when compared with lithium-ion batteries, have high internal resistance, are inherently inefficient during charging or discharging in cyclic load applications and therefore require longer to charge, resulting in higher fuel costs. In 2011, we completed the design and testing of a hybrid power system, where our DC power system was integrated with lithium-ion batteries to provide a longer life and higher fuel efficiency to cyclic DC power applications such as telecommunications towers.
 
Our DC hybrid power systems can monitor the charge/discharge cycle of either lithium-ion or lead acid batteries, or other battery types, on a cell by cell basis using our BMS. Our Supra Controller™ system incorporates a CAN bus communications capability that provides communication and control between the battery and the DC hybrid power system. Each cell in the battery pack is individually monitored for voltage and temperature, ensuring the safety and longevity of the battery bank. These power systems include enclosures, a lithium-ion battery pack, our proprietary BMS and our proprietary Supra Controller™ system that controls engine output, battery charging algorithms, cooling system and power control circuits that optimize DC load outputs.
 
DC Solar Hybrid Power Systems
 
Our DC solar hybrid power system combines our DC hybrid power system with solar photovoltaic modules and a custom engineered multi power point tracking charge controller. In most off-grid or bad-grid outdoor applications, such as telecommunications towers in rural or suburban areas, the fuel costs of operating a generator can account for more than half of the total operating costs. We believe that incorporating renewable energy sources, such as solar, with our DC hybrid power systems is ideal solution for numerous off-grid and bad-grid applications worldwide. Our DC solar hybrid power systems incorporate the following features:

· | Hybrid power panel. We produce distribution panel assemblies that make use of punched and plated buss bars to make the heavy current connections between appliances. The industry standard is using labor intensive hand crimped wires and lugs which are accomplished in the field.
