ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview
 
Digerati Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (including our subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “Company” or “Digerati”), through its operating subsidiaries, Shift8 Networks, Inc., dba Synergy Telecom (“Shift8”) and T3 Communications, Inc. (“T3”), provides cloud services specializing in Unified Communications as a Service (“UCaaS”) solutions for the business market. Our product line includes a portfolio of Internet-based telephony products and services delivered through our cloud application platform and session-based communication network and network services including Internet broadband, fiber, and cloud WAN solutions. Our services are designed to provide enterprise-class, carrier-grade services to the small-to-medium-sized business ("SMB") at cost-effective monthly rates. Our UCaaS or cloud communication services include fully hosted IP/PBX, mobile applications, Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) transport, SIP trunking, and customized VoIP services all delivered Only in the Cloud™.
 
As a provider of cloud communications solutions to the SMB, we are seeking to capitalize on the migration by businesses from the legacy telephone network to the Internet Protocol (“IP”) telecommunication network and the migration from hardware-based on-premise telephone systems to software-based communication systems in the cloud. Most SMBs are lagging in technical capabilities and advancement and seldom reach the economies of scale that their larger counterparts enjoy, due to their achievement of a critical mass and ability to deploy a single solution to a large number of workers. SMBs are typically unable to afford comprehensive enterprise solutions and, therefore, need to integrate a combination of business solutions to meet their needs. Cloud computing has revolutionized the industry and opened the door for businesses of all sizes to gain access to enterprise applications with affordable pricing. This especially holds true for cloud telephony applications, but SMBs are still a higher-touch sale that requires customer support for system integration, network installation, cabling, and troubleshooting. We have placed a significant emphasis on that “local” touch when selling, delivering, and supporting our services which we believe will differentiate us from the national providers that are experiencing high attrition rates due to poor customer support model.
 
The adoption of cloud communication services is being driven by the convergence of several market trends, including the increasing costs of maintaining installed legacy communications systems, the fragmentation resulting from use of multiple on-premise systems, and the proliferation of personal smartphones used in the workplace. Today, businesses are increasingly looking for an affordable path to modernizing their communications system to improve productivity, business performance and customer experience.
 
Our cloud solutions offer the SMB reliable, robust, and full-featured services at affordable monthly rates that eliminates high-cost capital expenditures and provides for integration with other cloud-based systems.
 
Recent Developments
 
On December 1, 2017, Shift8 Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Shift8”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Digerati Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), and Synergy Telecom, Inc., a Texas corporation ("Synergy"), closed a transaction to acquire all the assets, assumed all customers, and critical vendor arrangements from Synergy.
 
On May2, 2018, Shift8 completed the acquisition of T3 Communications, Inc., an established UCaaS and Internet broadband provider serving a high-growth corridor in Southwest Florida.
 
During the year ended July 31, 2018, we have raised $480,000 through the issuance of 960,000 shares of Digerati common stock and three-year warrants to purchase up to 180,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share.

Products and Services
 
We provide a comprehensive suite of Internet-based communication services to meet the global needs of businesses that are seeking simple, flexible, and cost-effective communication solutions. Our Internet-based services include fully hosted IP/PBX services, SIP trunking, call center applications, interactive voice response auto attendant, voice and web conferencing, call recording, simultaneous calling, voicemail to email conversion, integrated mobility applications that are device and location agnostic, and multiple customized IP/PBX features in a hosted or cloud environment. Our services, known as UCaaS or cloud communications, are specifically designed for the needs of the small to medium-sized business, enterprise customers, call centers, and telephony service providers that do not have the scale or expertise necessary to deploy their own cloud telephony infrastructure.
 
Through our recent acquisitions, we have enhanced our product portfolio with the addition of enterprise-class data and connectivity solutions through multiple broadband technologies including cloud WAN or SD-WAN (Software-defined Wide Area Network), fiber, and Ethernet over copper. Other services include remote network monitoring, data backup and disaster recovery. The addition of these new products and services allows us to increase our value-proposition through product bundles that go beyond the voice application and to serve as a one-stop-shop for business customers seeking a comprehensive voice and data solution.
 
Voice over Internet Protocol Networks 
 
The basic technology of traditional telecommunications systems was designed for slow mechanical switches. Communications over the traditional telephone network are routed through circuits that must dedicate all circuit resources to each call from its inception until the call ends, regardless of whether anyone is actually talking on the circuit. This circuit-switching technology incurs a significant cost per call and does not efficiently support the integration of voice with data services. Data networks, however, were designed for electronic switching. They break the data stream into small, individually addressed packages of data (“packets”) that are routed independently of each other from the origin to the destination. Therefore, they do not require a fixed amount of bandwidth to be reserved between the origin and destination of each call and they do not waste bandwidth when it is not being used for actual transmission of information. This allows multiple voice or voice and data calls to be pooled, resulting in these networks being able to carry more calls with an equal amount of bandwidth. Moreover, they do not require the same complex switching methods required by traditional voice telephone networks, instead using a multiplicity of routers to direct each packet to its destination and automatically routing packets around blockages, congestion or outages.
 
Packet switching can be used within a data network or across networks, including the public Internet. The Internet itself is not a single data network owned by any single entity, but rather a loose interconnection of networks belonging to many owners that communicate using the Internet Protocol. By converting voice signals to digital data and handling the voice signals as data, it can be transmitted through the more efficient switching networks designed for data transmissions and through the Internet using the Internet Protocol. The transmission of voice signals as digitalized data streams over the Internet is known as Voice over Internet Protocol or “VoIP”. A VoIP network has the following advantages over traditional networks:
 

● | Simplification: An integrated infrastructure that supports all forms of communication allows more standardization, a smaller equipment complement, and less equipment management.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Network Efficiency: The integration of voice and data fills up the data communication channels efficiently, thus providing bandwidth consolidation and reduction of the costs associated with idle bandwidth. This combined infrastructure can support dynamic bandwidth optimization and a fault tolerant design. The differences between the traffic patterns of voice and data offer further opportunities for significant efficiency improvements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Co-existence with traditional communication mediums: IP telephony can be used in conjunction with existing public telephone system switches, leased and dial-up lines, PBXs and other customer premise equipment, enterprise LANs, and Internet connections. IP telephony applications can be implemented through dedicated gateways, which in turn can be based on open standards platforms for reliability and scalability.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cost reduction: Under the VoIP network, the connection is directly to the Internet backbone and as a result the telephony access charges and settlement fees are avoided.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The growth of voice over the Internet was limited in the past due to poor sound quality caused by technical issues such as delays in packet transmission and by bandwidth limitations related to Internet network capacity and local access constraints. However, the expansion of Internet Protocol network infrastructure, improvements in packet switching and compression technology, new software algorithms and improved hardware have substantially reduced delays in packet transmissions and resulted in superior sound quality to that of the legacy telephone network.

Cloud Communications
 
Cloud communications are Internet-based voice and data communications where telecommunications applications, switching and storage are hosted by a third-party service provider outside of the organization using the services. Services are accessed by the user over the public Internet. Cloud telephony refers specifically to voice services and more specifically the replacement of conventional business telephone equipment (such as a PBX) with VoIP service hosted by a third-party service provider and delivered over the Internet.
 
We operate a cloud communication network that consists of a VoIP switching system and cloud telephony application platform. Our network allows us to provide end-to-end cloud telephony solutions designed to provide significant benefits to businesses of all sizes, with single or multiple locations. The integration of our cloud communication platform and global VoIP network allows us to provide our customers with virtually any type of telephony solution on a global basis.
 
Our cloud communication solutions, also known as UCaaS, are designed to minimize upfront capital costs, increase the scalability and flexibility of the customer’s communications network and service environment, provide robust features and functionality to increase productivity and reduce the overall cost of communications.
 
Strategy
 
Our strategy is to target the small to medium-sized business market and capitalize on the wave of migration from the legacy telephone network to cloud telephony. We will continue to concentrate our sales and marketing efforts on developing vertically oriented solutions for targeted markets primarily focusing on municipalities, banking, healthcare, legal services and real estate. In addition, we will continue to partner with our distributors and Value-Added Resellers (“VARs”) to expand our customer base. Our typical VAR is an information technology services firm, traditional PBX vendor, managed service provider, or systems integrator that has established relationships with businesses in its local market. These VARs are currently providing local customer support for other IT or PBX services but lack the technology infrastructure to provide cloud communication and VoIP services to their customers. Our strategy allows these VARs to focus on their strength of providing first tier support to their customers while we provide the second and third tier technical support required to operate a cloud communication and VoIP network. In addition, we transform our VARs’ business model by introducing new cloud telephony services and adding a new and lucrative recurring revenue stream that increases the VARs’ value proposition for its current and prospective customers.
 
Our cloud-based technology platform enables us and our VARs to deliver enhanced voice services to their business customers. The features supported on our cloud communication platform include all standard telephone features and value-added applications such as voicemail to email, VoIP peering, teleconferencing, IVR auto attendant, and dial-by-name directory. Our system provides our customers and VARs with a migration path from a traditional PBX system to a complete cloud-based PBX solution.
 
Our strategic initiatives to successfully meet our long-term business objectives include:
 

● | A disciplined approach to evaluating additional acquisitions as we build on the foundation created by our most recent acquisitions in Texas and Florida. We will continue to target local and/or regional UCaaS/cloud telephony providers which have excelled in their market with that “local” touch when serving their business customers. We believe the experience gained in integrating products, personnel, and customers will facilitate continued growth via acquisition.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | A continued emphasis on our UCaaS/cloud communication business which operates in a segment of the telecommunication industry that continues to experience significant growth as businesses migrate from legacy phone systems to cloud-based telephony systems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhancements to our broadband product portfolio with an emphasis on marketing leading-edge network and business continuity solutions like cloud WAN, also known as SD-WAN (Software Defined Wide-Area Network), to our customers which we anticipate will increase average revenue per customer.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implementing a total support model (pre and post sales) for building a world-class service delivery and help desk organization.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Emphasis on our sales distribution model that enables our VARs to offer cloud and session-based communication services to the enterprise market in various regions and industries.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue enhancing our infrastructure and back office system to streamline operations, automate key processes, and support the scalability of our VAR distribution model.

Competitive Conditions
 
The cloud services industry, including the provisioning of cloud communications services, cloud connectivity, cloud storage and cloud computing, as well as carrier voice and data services, is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change and intense marketing by providers with similar products and services. We expect that new, smaller, but very agile competitors, specializing in providing service to regional and emerging markets at low margin and hence low cost, may have an impact on our market. Similarly, the business services market includes competitors who may be significantly larger and have substantially greater market presence, financial, technical, operational and marketing resources than we do, including Tier 1 carriers, cable companies and premise-based solutions providers that are implementing cloud communication services. In the event that such a competitor expends significant sales and marketing resources in one or several markets where we compete with them, we may not be able to compete successfully in those markets. Specialized cloud services providers, who focus on one or more cloud service or application, could adopt aggressive pricing and promotion practices that could impact our ability to compete. We also believe that competition will continue to increase, placing downward pressure on prices. Such pressure could adversely affect our gross margins if we are not able to reduce our costs commensurate with the price reductions of our competitors. In addition, the pace of technological change makes it impossible for us to predict whether we will face new competitors using different technologies to provide the same or similar services offered or proposed to be offered by us. If our competitors were to provide better and more cost-effective services than ours, we may not be able to increase our revenues or capture any significant market share.
 
The VoIP and Internet telephony market are highly competitive. Our competitors include major telecommunications carriers in the U.S., national UCaaS providers, and numerous small cloud telephony operators. We expect to face continuing competition based on price and service offerings from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future. The principal competitive factors in our market include price, coverage, customer service, technical response times, reliability, and network size/capacity. The competitive landscape is rapidly altering the number, identity and competitiveness of the marketplace, and we are unable to determine with certainty the impact of potential consolidation in our industry.
 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we have. As a result, certain of these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies that could hinder our ability to market our services. We believe that our key competitive advantages are our ability to deliver reliable, high quality voice service over the Internet in a cost-effective manner, superior customers service and our VAR distribution model. We cannot provide assurances, however, that these advantages will enable us to succeed against comparable service offerings from our competitors.

Government Regulation
 
VoIP and other communications services, like ours, have been subject to less regulation at the state and federal levels than traditional telecommunications services. Providers of traditional telecommunications services are subject to the highest degree of regulation, while providers of VoIP and other information services are largely exempt from most federal and state regulations governing traditional common carriers. The FCC has subjected VoIP service providers to a smaller subset of regulations that apply to traditional telecommunications service providers and has not yet classified VoIP services as either telecommunications or information. The FCC is currently examining the status of VoIP service providers and the services they provide in multiple open proceedings. In addition, many state regulatory agencies impose taxes and other surcharges on VoIP services, and certain states take the position that offerings by VoIP providers are intrastate telecommunications services and therefore subject to state regulation. These states argue that if the beginning and end points of communications are known, and if some of these communications occur entirely within the boundaries of a state, the state can regulate that offering. We believe that the FCC has preempted states from regulating VoIP offerings in the same manner as providers of traditional telecommunications services. However, this issue has not been resolved definitively as a matter of law, and it remains possible that the FCC could determine that such services are not information services, or that there could be a judicial or legislative determination that the states are not preempted from regulating VoIP services as traditional telecommunications services. We cannot predict how or when these issues will be resolved or its potential future impact on our business at this time.
 
The effect of any future laws, regulations and orders on our operations, including, but not limited to, our cloud-based communications and collaboration services, cannot be determined. But as a general matter, increased regulation and the imposition of additional funding obligations increases service costs that may or may not be recoverable from our customers, which could result in making our services less competitive with traditional telecommunications services if we increase our prices or decreasing our profit margins if we attempt to absorb such costs.
 
Federal, state, local and foreign governmental organizations are considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate and/or tax applications running over the Internet. We cannot predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending on the type of taxes imposed, whether and how our services would be affected thereafter. Increased regulation of the Internet may decrease its growth and hinder technological development, which may negatively impact the cost of doing business via the Internet or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Regulation of Internet-based Telecommunication Services in the United States
 
We have the necessary authority under Section 214 of the Communications Act to operate as a domestic and international carrier. We are considered a non-dominant domestic interstate carrier subject to minimal regulation by the FCC. We are not required to obtain FCC authority to initiate or expand our domestic interstate operations, but we are required to obtain FCC approval to transfer control or discontinue service and are required to file various reports and pay various fees and assessments. In addition, we must offer service on a nondiscriminatory basis at just and reasonable rates and are subject to the FCC’s complaint jurisdiction. Generally, our international voice traffic is subject to minimal regulation by state and local jurisdictions.
 
The FCC requires Internet voice communications service providers, such as our company, to provide E-911 service in all geographic areas covered by the traditional wire-line E-911 network. Under the FCC’s rules, Internet voice communications providers must transmit the caller’s phone number and registered location information to the appropriate public safety answering point, or PSAP, for the caller’s registered location. The FCC also requires interconnected VoIP service providers to make Universal Service Fund (“USF”) contributions. We believe that our services are currently compliant with all applicable requirements of the FCC, and we have made and are making the required contributions to the USF. However, should we at some time fail to meet certain requirements or fail to make required contributions, we could be subject to revocation of our authority to operate or to fines or penalties.
 
As a result of the FCC’s preemption of states’ ability to regulate certain aspects of VoIP service, and a trend in state legislatures to affirmatively deregulate VoIP services for most purposes, our VoIP services are subject to relatively few state regulatory requirements aside from collection of state and local E911 fees and state Universal Service support obligations. We believe that our VoIP services are currently compliant with all applicable state requirements, and we have made and are making the required contributions to E911, state USF, and other funds. The state regulatory framework for our VoIP services continues to evolve, so we, in conjunction with our professional advisors, monitor the actions of the various state regulatory agencies and endeavor to ensure that we are in compliance with applicable state law, including any new statutes or regulations that may be passed. However, there can be no assurance that we will become aware of all applicable requirements on a timely basis, or that we will always be fully compliant with applicable rules and regulations. Should we fail to be compliant with applicable state regulations, or to file required reports with state regulatory agencies, we could be subject to fines and/or penalties.

In addition to regulations addressing Internet telephony and broadband services, other regulatory issues relating to the Internet generally could affect our ability to provide our services. Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet including online content, user privacy, taxation, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. In addition, a number of initiatives pending in Congress and state legislatures would prohibit or restrict advertising or sale of certain products and services on the Internet, which may have the effect of raising the cost of doing business on the Internet generally.
 
International Regulation
 
The regulatory treatment of Internet telephony outside of the U.S. varies widely from country to country. A number of countries that currently prohibit competition in the provision of voice telephony also prohibit Internet telephony. Other countries permit but regulate Internet telephony. Some countries will evaluate proposed Internet telephony service on a case-by-case basis and determine whether it should be regulated as a voice service or as another telecommunications service. In many countries, Internet telephony has not yet been addressed by legislation or regulation. Increased regulation of the Internet and/or Internet telephony providers or the prohibition of Internet telephony in one or more countries could adversely affect our business and future prospects if we decide to expand globally.
Customers and Suppliers
 
We rely on various suppliers to provide services in connection with our Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") or Unified Communication as a Service ("UCaaS") offerings. Our customers include businesses in various industries including Healthcare, Banking, Financial Services, Legal, Real Estate, and Construction. We are not dependent upon any single supplier or customer.
 
During the year ended July 31, 2018, the Company did not derived a significant amount of revenue from one single customer. During the year ended July 31, 2018, the Company derived a significant amount revenue from four customers, comprising 24%, 24%, 11%, and 8% of the total revenue for the year.
 
As of the year ended July 31, 2018, the company derived 13% and 23% total accounts receivable from two customers. During the year ended July 31, 2017, the Company derived a significant amount of accounts receivable from three customers, comprising 37%, 27% and 14% of the total accounts receivable for the year ended July 31, 2017.


Employees
 
As of July 31, 2018, we had 26 employees, all of whom performed sales, operational, technical and administrative functions. We believe our future success will depend to a large extent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees. We consider our employee relations to be good. None of these aforementioned employees belong to labor unions.

DIGERATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 AND SUBSIDIARIES
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Description of Business. Digerati Technologies, Inc. (“we”, “our”, “Company” or “Digerati”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 24, 2004. Digerati is a diversified holding company that has no independent operations apart from its subsidiaries. Through our operating subsidiaries, T3 Communications, Inc., and Shift8 Networks, Inc., dba, Synergy Telecom, we are an established provider of cloud services specializing in UCaaS (Unified Communications as a Service) solutions for the small to medium-sized business (“SMB”) market. We offer a comprehensive suite of cloud communication services to meet the global needs of businesses that are seeking simple, flexible, and cost-effective communication solutions. Our services include cloud PBX, cloud mobile, Internet broadband, cloud WAN, SIP trunking, and customized VoIP services, all delivered on its global carrier-grade network and Only in the Cloud™.
 
In December 2017, we closed a transaction to acquire all the assets, assumed all customers, and critical vendor arrangements from Synergy Telecom, Inc. Synergy provides UCaaS or cloud communication services to small and medium-sized businesses and municipalities, primarily in Texas.
 
In May 2018, we completed the acquisition of T3 Communications, Inc., an established UCaaS and Internet broadband provider serving a high-growth corridor in Southwest Florida.
 
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Digerati, and its subsidiaries, which are majority owned by Digerati In accordance with ASC 810-10-05. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Reclassifications. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current year for comparative purposes.
Use of Estimates. In preparing financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenue and expenses in the statement of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject Digerati to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. In the normal course of business, Digerati provides credit terms to its customers. Accordingly, Digerati performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for possible losses, which, when realized, have been within the range of management’s expectations. Digerati maintains cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Digerati has not experienced any losses in such accounts and Digerati does not believe it’s exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.
Revenue Recognition. Digerati derives revenue from UCaaS or cloud communication services and managed cloud-based services. Our services include fully hosted IP/PBX services, SIP trunking, call center applications, interactive voice response auto attendant, call recording, simultaneous calling, voicemail to email conversion, disaster recovery services and multiple customized IP/PBX features in a hosted or cloud environment. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, service or network capacity has been provided, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and there are no significant obligations remaining.
 
Digerati records and reports its revenue on the gross amount billed to its customers in accordance with the following indicators:
 

● | Digerati is the primary obligor in its arrangements,
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Digerati has latitude in establishing pricing,
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | Digerati changes the product or performs part of the service and is involved in the determination of the product or service specifications,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Digerati has discretion in supplier selection and
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | Digerati assumes credit risk for the amount billed to the customer.

Sources of revenue: 
 
Cloud-based hosted Services: We provide UCaaS or cloud communication services and managed cloud-based solutions to small and medium size enterprise customers and to other resellers. Our Internet-based services include fully hosted IP/PBX services, SIP trunking, call center applications, interactive voice response auto attendant, voice and web conferencing, call recording, simultaneous calling, voicemail to email conversion, integrated mobility applications that are device and location agnostic, and multiple customized IP/PBX features in a hosted or cloud environment. Other services include enterprise-class data and connectivity solutions through multiple broadband technologies including cloud WAN or SD-WAN (Software-defined Wide Area Network), fiber, and Ethernet over copper. We also offer remote network monitoring, data backup and disaster recovery.
Direct Costs: 
 
Cloud-based hosted Services: We incur bandwidth and colocation charges in connection with our UCaaS or cloud communication services. The bandwidth charges are incurred as part of the connectivity between our customers to allow them access to our various services. We also incur costs from underlying providers for fiber, Internet broadband, and telecommunication circuits in connection with our data and connectivity solutions.
 
Cash and cash equivalents. The Company considers all bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
 
Bad debt expense is recognized based on management’s estimate of likely losses each year based on past experience and an estimate of current year uncollectible amounts. As of July 31, 2018 and 2017, Digerati’s allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $122,000 and $0, respectively.
 
Customer deposits.
 
The Company in some instances requires customers to make deposits for equipment, installation charges and training. As equipment is installed and training takes places the deposits are then applied to revenue. As of July 31, 2018 and 2017, Digerati’s customer deposits balance was $262,000 and $131,000, respectively.
 
Property and equipment. Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Additions are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are one to five years.
 
Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Long-Lived Assets
 
Goodwill is carried at cost and is not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Company management uses its judgment in assessing whether goodwill has become impaired between annual impairment tests according to specifications set forth in ASC 350. The Company completed an evaluation of goodwill at July 31, 2018 and determined that there was no impairment. We did not have any goodwill during the year ended July 31, 2017.
 
The fair value of the Company’s reporting unit is dependent upon the Company’s estimate of future cash flows and other factors. The Company’s estimates of future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions and may differ from actual future cash flows. Estimated future cash flows are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from the Company’s market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at date of the evaluation.
 

25
--

 

The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts the Company’s fair value measurement through the Company’s weighted average cost of capital that the Company uses to determine its discount rate and through the Company’s stock price that the Company uses to determine its market capitalization. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded.
 
The Company recognizes an acquired intangible asset apart from goodwill whenever the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Such intangibles are amortized over their useful lives. Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
 
The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property and equipment, identifiable intangibles, and goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine recoverability of its long-lived assets, the Company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets.
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Digerati reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. Digerati assesses recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair value.
 
Derivative financial instruments. Digerati does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. However, Digerati analyzes its convertible instruments and free-standing instruments such as warrants for derivative liability accounting.
 
For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, any changes in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period. For option-based derivative financial instruments, warrants and notes payable conversion options Digerati uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments.
 
The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is probable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date.
 
Notes payable conversion options are recorded as debt discounts and are amortized as interest expense over the term of the related debt instrument.
 
Sequencing Policy
 
In January 2018, as a result of entering into a convertible debenture which contained a variable conversion feature with no floor, we adopted a sequencing policy in accordance with ASC 815-40-35-12 The Company retrospectively is adopting the sequencing policy so all warrants with fixed exercise price, and convertible notes with fixed conversion price or with a conversion price floor are sequenced by issue date thus excluded from derivative consideration.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is used which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy based on the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:
Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 
Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

26
--

Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.
 
For certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its fair value based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities.
 
Our derivative liabilities as of July 31, 2018 and 2017 of $632,000 and $0, respectively, were valued using Level 3 inputs.
 
The following table provides a summary of the changes in fair value of the derivative financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs:
 

Balance at July 31, 2017 | $ | - 
---------------------------------------+---+--------
Derivative discount - convertible debt | | 541,000
Derivative loss | | 91,000 
Balance at July 31, 2018 | $ | 632,000

 
Income taxes. Digerati recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. Digerati provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.
 
Since January 1, 2007, Digerati accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on income taxes which addresses how an entity should recognize, measure and present in the financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Pursuant to this guidance, Digerati recognizes a tax benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent the “more likely than not” standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. As of July 31, 2017 we have no liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
 
Stock-based compensation. In June 2018 FASB adopted the Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-07, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This update simplifies the accounting for non employee share-based payment transactions by expanding the scope of Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within that reporting period. The Company adopted the updated standard as of May 1, 2018 and adopting this guidance did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. During fiscal 2017 and 2018, the Company issued 1,003,970 common shares and 2,213,512 common shares, respectively to various employees as part of our profit-sharing plan contribution and stock in lieu of cash. At the time of issuance during fiscal 2017 and 2018 we recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $241,000 and $1,240,000, respectively equivalent to the market value of the shares issued calculated based on the share’s closing price at the grant dates.

Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share. The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an “as if converted” basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the year ended July 31, 2017, potential dilutive securities including options and warrants had dilutive effect and were included in the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per common share. For the year ended July 31, 2018, potential dilutive securities including options and warrants were not included in the calculation of diluted net (loss) per common share. Potential dilutive securities, which are not included in dilutive weighted average shares are as follows:
 

 | 7/31/2018 | | 7/31/2017
----------------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------
Options to purchase common stock | | 3,415,000 | | 1,170,000
Warrants to purchase common stock | | 2,370,000 | | 51,000 
Convertible debt | | 3,268,214 | | - 
Total: | | 9,053,214 | | 1,221,000

 
Noncontrolling interest
 
The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810, Consolidation, which governs the accounting for and reporting of non-controlling interests (“NCIs”) in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries. Certain provisions of this standard indicate, among other things, that NCIs be treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability, that increases and decreases in the parent’s ownership interest that leave control intact be treated as equity transactions rather than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses, and that losses of a partially owned consolidated subsidiary be allocated to the NCI even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance.
 
The net income (loss) attributed to the NCI is separately designated in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss). For the year ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized a noncontrolling deficits of $57,000 and $0, respectively.
 
Recently issued accounting pronouncements. 
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Accounting Standards Codification. The updated guidance states that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also provides for additional disclosures with respect to revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The standard will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and the Company adopted the standard effective August 1, 2018.
 

28
--

 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The amendments under this pronouncement will change the way all leases with a duration of one year or more are treated. Under this guidance, lessees will be required to capitalize virtually all leases on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and an associated financing lease liability or capital lease liability. The right-of-use asset represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the specified lease term. The lease liability represents the lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease, measured on a discounted basis. Based on certain characteristics, leases are classified as financing leases or operating leases. Financing lease liabilities, those that contain provisions similar to capitalized leases, are amortized like capital leases are under current accounting, as amortization expense and interest expense in the statement of operations. Operating lease liabilities are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease as lease expense in the statement of operations. This update is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2018.  In July 2018 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases and ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, which provided additional implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
 
In June 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-07, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This update simplifies the accounting for non-employee share-based payment transactions by expanding the scope of Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within that reporting period. The Company adopted this updated standard as of May 1, 2018, and adopting this guidance did not have a material effect on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN
 
Financial Condition
 
Digerati’s consolidated financial statements for the year ending July 31, 2018 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Digerati has incurred net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately $80,800,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $3,722,000which raises substantial doubt about Digerati’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management Plans to Continue as a Going Concern
 
Management believes that current available resources will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations over the next 12 months. The Company’s ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional capital or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding, the Company will seek to secure such additional funding from various possible sources, including the public equity market, private financings, sales of assets, collaborative arrangements and debt. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required to delay or reduce the scope of its operations, and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due.
 
The Company will continue to work with various funding sources to secure additional debt and equity financings. However, Digerati cannot offer any assurance that it will be successful in executing the aforementioned plans to continue as a going concern.
 
Digerati’s consolidated financial statements as of July 31, 2018 do not include any adjustments that might result from the inability to implement or execute Digerati’s plans to improve our ability to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 3 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
 
During fiscal 2008, Digerati made a loan of $150,000 to NetSapiens Inc. The note receivable had a maturity date of June 26, 2008 with interest at 8% per year. The note was secured by NetSapiens’ proprietary Starter Platform License and SNAPsolution modules. On June 26, 2008 Digerati converted the outstanding interest and principal balance into a lifetime and perpetual NetSapiens’ License. The License provides Digerati with the ability to offer Hosted PBX (Private Branch eXchange), IP Centrex application, prepaid calling, call center, conferencing, messaging and other innovative telephony functionality necessary to offer standard and/or custom services to enterprise markets. The NetSapiens’ License, in the amount of $150,000, is being amortized equally over a period of 10 years. For the years ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, amortization totaled approximately $13,750 and $15,000, respectively. As of July 31, 2018 the NetSapiens’ License is fully amortized.
 
On December 1, 2017, Shift8 and Synergy Telecom, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Synergy”), closed a transaction to acquire all the assets, assumed all customers, and critical vendor arrangements from Synergy. The total purchase price was $425,000, the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with Digerati identified as the acquirer. Under the purchase method of accounting, the aggregate amount of consideration assumed by Digerati was allocated to customer contracts acquired, software licenses, and goodwill based on their fair values as of July 31, 2018.
 
The following information summarizes the allocation of the fair values assigned to the assets. The allocation of fair values is based on an extensive analysis and is subject to changes in the future during the measurement period.
 

 | Synergy | | Useful life (years) 
-----------------------+---------+---------+---------------------
Customer relatiosnhips | $ | 40,000 | | 5
License - software | | 105,000 | | 3

Total Purchase price | $ | 425,000 | | 

 
For the years ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, amortization expense for the acquired intangible was $25,000 and $0, respectively.
 
On May 2, 2018, the Company closed on the Merger Agreement with T3 Communications, Inc. to increase its customer base and obtain higher efficiency of its existing infrastructure.
 
The total purchase price was $3,211,945 paid in cash at closing. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with the Company identified as the acquirer. Under the purchase method of accounting, the aggregate amount of consideration assumed by the Company was allocated to cash, customer contracts acquired, current assets, property plant and equipment and assumed payables based on their estimated fair values as of May 2, 2018.
 
The following information summarizes the allocation of the purchase price assigned to intangible assets. The allocation of fair values is based on an extensive analysis and is subject to changes in the future during the measurement period.

NOTE 5 – INCOME TAXES
 
Digerati files a consolidated tax return. The current tax year is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and certain state taxing authorities. As of July 31, 2018, Digerati had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $5,956,000 to reduce future federal income tax liabilities; the loss carryforwards will start to expire in 2020. Under the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the new effective Corporate flat tax rate is 21% (effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017). Income tax benefit (provision) for the years ended July 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:
 
The effective tax rate for Digerati is reconciled to statutory rates as follows:
 

 | 2018 | | | 2017
--------------------------------------------------------+------+-------+----+-----
Expected Federal benefit (provision), at statutory rate | | 21.0 | % | | 35.0 | % 
Change in valuation allowance | | (21.0 | )% | | (35.0 | )%

Deferred tax assets are comprised of the following as of July 31, 2018 and 2016:
 

 | 2018 | | | 2017 | 
------------------------------+------+------------+---+------+--
Net operating loss carryover | $ | 1,090,700 | | | $ | 1,282,000 | 
Valuation allowance | | (1,090,700 | ) | | | (1,282,000 | )
Total deferred tax asset, net | $ | - | | | $ | - | 

 
At July 31, 2018, realization of Digerati’s deferred tax assets was not considered likely to be realized. The change in the valuation allowance for 2018 was resulted in a decrease of approximately $191,000. Management has evaluated and concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in Digerati’s combined financial statements. The current year remains open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which Digerati is subject to tax. The Company files a calendar year return and the net operating loss was adjusted for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018.
 
During the year ended July 31, 2018 the Company issued 4,389,086 common shares, and under our initial assessment this will likely result in a change of control and the net operation loss (NOL’s) became subject to the separate return limitation year. We will evaluate during the tax year and consider the limitations.
 
We record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluate on new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.
