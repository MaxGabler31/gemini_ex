Item 1. | BUSINESS

In this annual report on Form 10-K, “USG,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to USG Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements, except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires.
General
USG, through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, is a leading manufacturer of building materials and innovative solutions that was originally formed in 1902. We produce a wide range of products for use in new residential, new nonresidential, and residential and nonresidential repair and remodel construction as well as products used in certain industrial processes. Our businesses are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including conditions in the North American housing and construction-based markets. Our expansion through two 50/50 joint ventures, referred to as USG Boral Building Products, or UBBP, we formed in 2014 with Boral Limited, or Boral, into the markets of Asia, Australasia, and the Middle East has significantly increased our exposure to the economic conditions in those areas. 
The effects of market conditions on our operations are discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Merger Agreement with Knauf
On June 10, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as it may be amended from time to time, or the Merger Agreement, with Gebr. Knauf KG, a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) organized under the laws of Germany, or Knauf, and World Cup Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Knauf, or Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, Merger Sub will be merged with and into USG, or the Merger, with USG continuing as the surviving corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Knauf. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.10, of USG issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than shares of common stock owned by Knauf and its subsidiaries, USG and its subsidiaries and certain excluded holders) will be converted into the right to receive $43.50 in cash, without interest and subject to tax withholding, or the closing consideration. In addition, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, we announced on August 9, 2018 that USG had declared a conditional special cash dividend of $0.50 per share, or the conditional special dividend, payable to holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on August 21, 2018. Payment of the conditional special dividend was conditioned on adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders at the special meeting held on September 26, 2018, or the special meeting. The Merger Agreement was adopted by our stockholders at the special meeting and following certification of the vote in favor of adoption, the conditional special dividend was paid on October 2, 2018.
The Merger, which is currently expected to close in early 2019, is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including, among others, receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both USG and Knauf. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, we will be required to pay Knauf a termination fee of $215 million.
See Note 4, Equity Method Investments, to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the default notice under the UBBP Shareholders Agreement delivered by Boral in connection with the Merger. Additional information about the Merger Agreement is set forth in Note 19, Merger Agreement, to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, and our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on June 11, 2018.
Segments
Our reportable segments align with how we manage our businesses, review operating performance and allocate resources considering the discrete information available for the geographies within those divisions. Our operating structure is generally aligned by product type and consists of three divisions, in addition to UBBP: Gypsum, Performance Materials and Ceilings. The operations of the divisions are similar throughout North America.
Our operations are organized into five reportable segments: U.S. Wallboard and Surfaces, U.S. Performance Materials, U.S. Ceilings, Canada, and UBBP. See Note 13, Segments, to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for financial information regarding our reportable segments.

The following graph reflects the breakdown by segment of our 2018 consolidated net sales of $3.3 billion.

Net sales of UBBP of $1.2 billion are excluded from the graph above as the joint ventures are accounted for as equity method investments. 
Gypsum
BUSINESS
Our Gypsum division manufactures and markets gypsum and related products in the United States, Canada and Mexico. It is composed of our U.S. Wallboard and Surfaces segment, the Gypsum operations of our Canada segment and the Gypsum operations in Mexico, which do not rise to the level of a reportable segment and thus are included in Other. We are the largest manufacturer of gypsum wallboard in the United States and accounted for approximately 24.5% of total industry shipments of gypsum board in 2018. The gypsum board market, as determined by the Gypsum Association, includes gypsum wallboard, other gypsum-related paneling products and imports. As such, we've included the Gypsum products of USG Sheetrock® brand gypsum wallboard and Securock® brand glass mat sheathing and the Performance Materials product of Fiberock® brand gypsum fiber panels in our estimate of our market share of the gypsum board market. In Canada, we accounted for approximately 31% of Canadian domestic shipments of gypsum board in 2018.
PRODUCTS
Gypsum's products are used in a variety of building applications to construct walls and ceilings of residential, nonresidential and institutional buildings. We also produce gypsum-based products for agricultural and industrial customers to use in a wide variety of applications, including soil conditioning, road repair, fireproofing and ceramics. The major product lines within the Gypsum division are:

WALLBOARD 
USG Sheetrock® brand gypsum wallboard and Securock® brand glass mat sheathing portfolios | Gypsum panels that provide aesthetic as well as sound-dampening, fire-retarding, abuse-resistance and moisture-control value 
SURFACES 
USG Sheetrock® brand joint compound portfolio, as well as corner bead, joint tape, and plaster | Used for finishing wallboard joints 
Construction plaster products, sold under the brand names Red Top®, Imperial®, Diamond® and Supremo™ and industrial gypsum | Used to provide a custom finish for residential and commercial interiors and provide aesthetic, sound-dampening, fire-retarding and abuse-resistance value

MANUFACTURING
Our Gypsum division manufactures products at plants located throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico, some of which are shared with the Performance Materials division. See Item 2, Properties.
Gypsum rock is mined or quarried at company-owned locations in North America. See Item 2, Properties. Our mines and quarries provided approximately 53% of the gypsum used by our plants in North America in 2018. Some of our manufacturing plants purchase or acquire synthetic gypsum and natural gypsum rock from outside sources. In 2018, outside sources of synthetic gypsum and natural gypsum rock accounted for approximately 39% and 8%, respectively, of the gypsum used in our North American plants. 
Synthetic gypsum is a byproduct of flue gas desulphurization carried out by electricity generation or industrial plants that burn coal as a fuel. The suppliers of this kind of gypsum are primarily power companies, which are required to operate scrubbing equipment for their coal-fired generating plants under federal environmental regulations. We have entered into a number of long-term supply agreements to acquire synthetic gypsum. Certain power companies have switched to using natural gas instead of coal for their electricity generation needs. In the event more power companies switch to using natural gas instead of coal, the availability of synthetic gypsum may decrease which could result in an increase to our cost. See Item 1A, Risk Factors.
We produce wallboard paper at four company-owned production facilities located in the United States. Vertical integration in paper helps to ensure a continuous supply of high-quality paper that is tailored to the specific needs of our production processes. We augment our paper needs through purchases from outside suppliers when necessary. We did not make any material purchases of paper from outside suppliers in 2018.
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
Our Gypsum products are marketed and distributed through specialty wallboard distributors, building materials dealers, home improvement centers and other retailers and contractors. Sales of Gypsum products are seasonal in the sense that sales are generally greater from spring through autumn than during the remaining part of the year.
Based on our estimates using publicly available data, internal surveys and industry shipment data for gypsum board, as reported by the Gypsum Association, we estimate that during 2018 volume demand for gypsum board was generated by:

• | residential and nonresidential repair and remodel activity of about 50%,


• | new residential construction of about 35%,


• | new nonresidential construction of about 10%, and


• | other activities, such as exports and temporary construction, of about 5%.

COMPETITION
Industry shipments of gypsum board in the United States (including gypsum wallboard, other gypsum-related paneling products and imports), as reported by the Gypsum Association, were an estimated 25.4 billion square feet in 2018, down approximately 1% from 25.7 billion square feet in 2017. Our share of the gypsum board market in the United States, which includes for comparability shipments of USG Sheetrock® brand gypsum wallboard, Fiberock® brand gypsum fiber panels and Securock® brand glass mat sheathing, decreased to 24.5% in 2018 from 25.4% in 2017.

Other Information
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
To differentiate through innovation and strengthen our leadership in the building materials industry, we perform extensive research and development at the USG Corporate Innovation Center in Libertyville, Illinois, using open innovation models and external partnerships. New technologies and products are developed by collaborating with suppliers, universities and national research laboratories to provide solutions to customer needs. With fire, acoustical, structural and environmental testing capabilities, the research center allows us to conduct our own on-site evaluation of products and systems. Chemical analysis and materials characterization support product development and safety/quality assessment programs. Development activities can be taken to an on-site pilot plant before being transferred to a full-size plant. Research and development activities have been focused on industry challenges including shortage of skilled labor, speed of construction and sustainability. UBBP also operates a research and development center in Thailand. 
SUSTAINABILITY
The adoption of green building codes and standards, such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, rating system established by the U.S. Green Building Council to encourage the design and construction of buildings that are environmentally friendly, combined with an increase in customer preference for products that can assist in obtaining LEED credit, or are otherwise environmentally preferable, has increased demand for products, systems and services that contribute to building sustainable spaces. Many of our products meet the requirements for the awarding of LEED credits, and we continue to develop new products and systems to address market demand for products that enable construction of buildings that require fewer natural resources to build, operate and maintain. Our competitors also have developed and introduced to the market more environmentally responsible products.
We expect that there will be increased demand over time for products, systems and services that meet regulatory and customer sustainability standards and preferences and decreased demand for products that produce significant greenhouse gas emissions. We also believe that our ability to continue to provide these products and systems to our customers will be necessary to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace.
ENERGY
Our primary supplies of energy have been adequate, and we have not been required to curtail operations as a result of insufficient supplies. Supplies are likely to remain sufficient for our projected requirements. Currently, we are using swap 
6

contracts to hedge a significant portion of our anticipated purchases of natural gas to be used in our manufacturing operations over the next 12 months and beyond. We review our positions regularly and make adjustments as market conditions warrant.
SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
On a worldwide basis, for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, The Home Depot accounted for 24%, 23% and 23% of our net consolidated sales, respectively, and L&W Supply Corporation, or L&W, accounted for 14%, 16% and 19% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. On October 31, 2016, we completed the sale of L&W to American Builders & Contractors Supply Co., Inc., or ABC Supply, for $675 million. Our U.S. Wallboard and Surfaces, U.S. Performance Materials, U.S. Ceilings and Canada segments each had net sales to these customers in each of those years. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We consider patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. We hold numerous patents and have registered numerous trademarks of varying duration in multiple legal jurisdictions. Further, we have filed patent applications and applications for the registration of trademarks in the United States and internationally. Although we consider our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and licenses to constitute valuable assets, we do not regard any of our businesses as being materially dependent upon an individual patent, trademark, trade secret, or license.
OTHER
Because we generally fill orders upon receipt, no segment has any significant order backlog.
None of our segments have any special working capital requirements.
No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government.
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 7,300 employees worldwide in our consolidated operations.
See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for information regarding the risks associated with conducting business in international locations, as well as the possible effects that compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have on our businesses and operating results.
