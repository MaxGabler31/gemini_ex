--------+---------

Our Company
 
Good Times Restaurants Inc., a Nevada corporation formed on October 6, 1996, operates Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants ( “Bad Daddy’s”) and Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard ( “Good Times”) restaurants. Bad Daddy’s and Good Times are two distinctly different, restaurant concepts. Each is positioned as a unique brand within its respective segment of the industry. Bad Daddy’s operates in the full-service dining segment as a specialty burger bar concept and Good Times operates in the quick-service restaurant segment as a drive-thru focused concept focused on all-natural burgers, fries, frozen custard.
 
Through our subsidiaries, as of December 14, 2022, we own and operate, or license a total of forty-one Bad Daddy’s restaurants in seven states. We own and operate fourteen Bad Daddy’s restaurants in North Carolina, twelve traditional Bad Daddy’s restaurants in Colorado, five in Georgia, four in South Carolina, two in Alabama, two in Tennessee and one in Oklahoma. Of these restaurants, five restaurants are operated through limited partnership arrangements where we are the operating partner and own between approximately 23% and 75% interest in the partnership entities. We license the Bad Daddy’s brand for the Bad Daddy’s restaurant located in the Charlotte Douglas International Airport which is owned and operated by a third-party licensee.
 
We currently own and operate or franchise thirty-one total Good Times restaurants. Of these restaurants, twenty-nine are in Colorado. Two of the restaurants are in Wyoming and are “dual brand” concept restaurants operated by a franchisee of both Good Times and Taco John’s.
 
The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” “Good Times” and similar terms refer to Good Times Restaurants Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Bad Daddy’s Franchise Development, LLC; Bad Daddy’s International, LLC (“BDI”); Good Times Drive-Thru Inc. (“Drive Thru”); and BD of Colorado, LLC. (“BD of Colo”) Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, financial and operating data in this 10-K report reflect the consolidated business and operations of Good Times Restaurants Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 
The Company’s fiscal year is a 52/53-week year ending on the last Tuesday of September. In a 52-week fiscal year, each of the Company’s quarterly periods comprise 13 weeks. The additional week in a 53-week fiscal year is added to the first quarter, making such quarter consist of 14 weeks. Our discussion for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, which ended on September 27, 2022 (‘fiscal 2022”) and September 28, 2021 (“fiscal 2021”), respectively, each cover periods of 52 full calendar weeks.

Recent Developments
 
Macro Economic Factors and Operating Environment
 
The global crisis resulting from the spread of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) impacted our restaurant operations for the fiscal years ended September 27, 2022 and September 28, 2021, though in fiscal 2022 the impact was more modest than in the prior year. During fiscal 2022, all restaurants remained open. We expect local conditions to continue to dictate limitations on restaurant operations, capacity, and hours of operation. COVID-19 has also contributed to labor challenges, which have increased hourly wages and management salaries at both concepts, and in limited cases have resulted in reduced operating hours at certain restaurants. Supply chain constraints have affected both of our concepts, resulting in higher food and beverage cost associated with general increases in input price levels as well as increased product substitutions, elevated freight costs, and increased variability in product quality, primarily in produce items. In addition, during fiscal 2022 and extending into fiscal 2023, high rates of inflation have been seen globally which have also resulted in increases in commodity, labor and energy costs for both concepts. Further significant increases in inflation could affect the global and U.S. economies, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations if we and our franchisees are not able to adjust prices sufficiently to offset the effect of cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand.

Although we conduct all of our restaurant operations within the USA, worldwide product supply chains have been impacted by the war in Ukraine. Specifically sunflower oil and wheat, which are fungible commodities, are used as ingredients in our raw materials and purchased by our suppliers, have significant supplies that typically originate in Ukraine. The lack of availability of supplies of such products may impact the availability and supplier pricing for products purchased by us for use in our business, which could result in higher food and packaging costs or reduced revenues.
 
We currently have a meaningful cash balance and generated significant cash flow from operations during fiscal 2022. We used a portion of this cash balance to repurchase Company stock by means of the Stock Repurchase Program during fiscal 2022 as described below.
 
Share Repurchase 
 
On February 7, 2022, the Company’s board of directors approved a program to purchase shares of its common stock at an aggregate amount of up to $5.0 million dollars. As of September 27, 2022, a total of 316,447 shares have been repurchased under the plan at an aggregate cost of approximately $1,065,000.
Debt
 
The Company maintains a credit agreement with Cadence Bank (“Cadence”) pursuant to which, as amended, Cadence has agreed to loan the Company up to $8,000,000 with a maturity date of January 31, 2023 (as amended, the “Cadence Credit Facility”). As amended by the various amendments, the Cadence Credit Facility accrues commitment fees on the daily unused balance of the facility at a rate of 0.25%. As of the date of filing of this report, any borrowings under the Cadence Credit Facility, as amended, bear interest at a variable rate based upon the Company’s election of (i) 2.5% plus the base rate, which is the highest of the (a) Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, (b) the Cadence Bank publicly announced prime rate, and (c) LIBOR plus 1.0%, or (ii) LIBOR, with a 0.250% floor, plus 3.5%. Interest is due at the end of each calendar quarter if the Company elects to pay interest based on the base rate and at the end of each LIBOR period if it elects to pay interest based on LIBOR. The Cadence Credit Facility includes provisions for the Administrative Agent of the facility to amend the facility to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate, which may be (but is not required to be) SOFR, at such point in time when appliable LIBOR rates are no longer available or no longer reliable. The exact timing of any transition of LIBOR to an alternate benchmark rate is not currently known. The Company is currently reviewing its future credit facility needs and intends to negotiate an amendment to the existing credit agreement or enter into a new credit agreement prior to January 31, 2023.
 
As of the date of filing of this report, the Cadence Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that the Company considers customary for an agreement of this type, including financial covenants setting a maximum leverage ratio of 5.15:1, a minimum pre-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25:1, a minimum post-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10:1 and minimum liquidity of $2.0 million. As of the date of filing of this report, the Company was in compliance with all of these financial covenants under the Cadence Credit Facility.
 
As a result of entering into the Cadence Credit Facility and the various amendments, the Company paid loan origination costs including professional fees of approximately $308,500 and is amortizing these costs over the term of the credit agreement. As of September 27, 2022 the unamortized balance of these fees is $20,000.
 
The obligations under the Cadence Credit Facility are collateralized by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the Company’s assets.
 
As of the date of filing of this report, there were no outstanding borrowings against the facility. Availability of the Cadence Credit Facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face value of any letters of credit issued under the facility. As of the date of filing of this report, there were no outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility.
 
On May 7, 2020, Good Times and three of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, BDI, Drive Thru, and BD of Colo (each a “Borrower”), entered into unsecured loans in the aggregate principal amount of $11,645,000 (the “Loans”) with Cadence Bank, N.A. (the “Lender”) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program.
 
In June 2021, the SBA approved forgiveness in full of the Loans, including accrued interest, in the aggregate amount of $11,778,226, which was recognized as gain on debt extinguishment in the fiscal year ended September 28, 2021. The principal and accrued interest balance on each of these Loans is now zero, as of the forgiveness date specific to each of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ Loans.
 
Total interest expense on notes payable was $20,000 and $269,000 for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.

Concepts
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar is a full-service, casual dining small box “better burger” concept. Bad Daddy’s currently operates all of its company-owned restaurants under a table service / full-bar service model.
 
There are three primary elements of the concept that we believe differentiates us from our competition:
 

1. | Scratch Cooking. The menu consists of chef-inspired burgers, sandwiches, main-course salads, and appetizers carefully crafted in-house with high-quality ingredients to deliver bold flavor profiles along with portion sizes and presentations that are uncommon in the casual dining segment of the industry. Beyond simply assembling finished ingredients on a plate, many of our sauces, dressings, and even our housemade American cheese are prepared from scratch in our restaurant kitchens. We offer our guests an extensive ability to customize their burgers and salads, including Create Your Own Burgers and Salads, restricted only by the ingredients available in the kitchen, which include a variety of different protein options including bison, turkey, chicken, salmon, and plant-based protein.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | A Bad Ass Bar. The food menu is complemented by a full bar that focuses on local and craft beers and proprietary, handcrafted cocktails. Two specialties are our Bad Daddy’s Amber Ale, available only at Bad Daddy’s, and our Bad Ass Margarita. System-wide, total alcoholic beverages have historically accounted for approximately 15% of sales in our Bad Daddy’s restaurants. As off-premises sales have increased resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, alcoholic beverage sales have declined to approximately 12.6% of restaurant sales. We focus on making our bar a place where both newcomers and regular guests can comfortably relax and enjoy a beverage at happy hour, with their meal, or at any other time of day.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Genuine Hospitality. The restaurants have a high-energy yet family friendly environment with iconic pop culture design elements and a personal, ultra-friendly and informal service platform with a legacy of southern hospitality. Bad Daddy’s menu, service and environment are designed around an irreverent brand personality, including unique menu items, iconic Farrah Fawcett and Paul Newman Cool Hand Luke posters in the men’s and women’s restrooms and our own playlist of classic rock and modern rock music that adds to the high energy atmosphere.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While clearly available for on-premises customers, all three of these elements are available for our off-premises guests as well, as we (1) offer the same customization on our off-premises ordering platforms as we offer in-restaurant, (2) where allowable by state or local regulation, we also provide our alcoholic beverages in an off-premises format for those customers who are ordering their meal for carryout or delivery, and (3) we offer the same level of hospitality to our carry-out guests and tightly manage our delivery service providers to a similar expectation of over-the-top service.
 
This brand positioning results in transactions that generate average sales per transaction of approximately $35. The lunch daypart (open until 2pm) represents approximately 35% and the happy hour and dinner dayparts (2pm until close) represent approximately 65% of restaurant sales. Off-premise sales, including take-out, delivery and curbside pickup, accounted for approximately 27% of all system-wide sales in Fiscal 2022. Off-premise sales average $29 per transaction while on-premise sales average $36 per transaction.
 
A typical Bad Daddy’s restaurant is approximately 3,500-4,000 square feet with an enclosed patio, smaller than most other chain casual dining restaurants. Fiscal 2022 average restaurant sales averaged $2.57 million per restaurant resulting in average sales per square foot of approximately $670. We believe this is a key metric indicating the strength and expansion potential of the concept.
 
While sharing common design elements, each restaurant has unique features intended to represent the local trade area of each Bad Daddy’s and serves as a further point of differentiation from the larger casual dining chains. We believe Bad Daddy’s’ innovative menu and personalized service combined with a unique, fun restaurant design enhance our customers’ experience and differentiate Bad Daddy’s from its competitors.
 
Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard
 
Good Times is a drive-thru, quick-service hamburger-focused restaurant concept offering fresh, 100% all-natural beef and chicken. We own and operate twenty-three Good Times restaurants, and franchise an additional eight, located primarily in the Denver market and along the front range of Colorado. We believe Good Times was the first quick-service chain in our region, and one of the first in the country, to offer a menu of fresh all-natural Angus beef and all-natural chicken from animals that are humanely raised and vegetarian fed without the use of added hormones, steroids, or antibiotics.
 
We compete primarily on the quality of our products, consistently prompt service, and order accuracy. We support our quality position by using only all-natural beef and chicken. Our all-natural frozen custard is made fresh throughout the day. These quality commitments help Good Times challenge quick-serve restaurant norms and match quality found at fast casual restaurants. Our focus on speed of service keeps our customers happy as most of our sales come from the drive thru. With menu innovation, we strive to create flavor profiles unique to Good Times. We have rotating limited time menu items and custard flavors. Our customers appreciate that we support local causes and do not take ourselves too seriously. Good Times makes use of various media but primarily communicate these advantages and promotions through the use of terrestrial radio and digital audio streaming.

Our average per person check is approximately $14.17, which we believe is slightly lower than the average check at fast casual hamburger concepts such as Habit Burger, Five Guys, and Smashburger, but well above the typical quick-service restaurant average check such as McDonalds, Wendy’s and Burger King. We do not offer a low-priced value menu like most national quick-service chains, choosing to define our value proposition based on quality ingredients with a specific focus on all-natural beef and chicken and products spanning a range of price choices within each of our menu categories. We have shifted our focus to a blend of quality and speed while slightly reducing the number of items on the menu.
 
Good Times is primarily a drive-thru concept, as all our restaurants have at least one drive-thru lane and generally have a walk-up window where customers may additionally place orders. Most of our restaurants have no indoor seating and consist of one drive-thru lane and outdoor patio seating. Speed of service in this segment is critical for success and we average less than three-minute transaction times, as measured from the time the customer places their order until they leave the drive-thru lane. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, even in our restaurants that feature dine-in seating, a majority of our sales were conducted through the drive-thru lane. Due to staffing constraints and customer preference for drive thru, our dining rooms remain closed.
 
The success of our strategy is evident in our long-term same-store sales growth (sales growth over the prior year period at restaurants open more than 18 months, also referred to as comparable sales). Same store sales increased 1.1% in fiscal 2022, and 10.5% in fiscal 2021, and five-year sales growth of 20.3%.
 
Our Business Strengths
 
Our Brands Are Complementary
 
While operating in different segments of the restaurant industry, our two brands complement each other in both their similarities and differences:
 
Each has a value proposition enhanced by superior quality ingredients and a focus on the specific elements of service relevant to the concept that deliver an exceptional experience to each guest. We believe Bad Daddy’s resonates with consumers by consistently executing high-quality, scratch-made menu items with bold flavors delivered in a high-energy environment with a slightly irreverent brand personality. The appeal of Bad Daddy’s is not solely based on a purely on-premise customer experience however, as the focus we place on bold, unique flavors; superior ingredients; and scratch cooking in each kitchen translates into significant off-premise adoption, both through traditional customer carry-out and delivery by third party delivery service providers.
 
We believe Good Times is the only drive-thru quick-service chain in our region with an all-natural platform. We do not offer a low-priced value menu as many national quick-service chains do, choosing to compete on a market position emphasizing quality with a specific focus on all-natural beef and chicken, and with a variety of price points across the menu with quick-service restaurant speed of service. The quick-service, and in particular, drive-thru format of our Good Times concept offers a balancing effect to business cycles that are common in the full-service segment of the restaurant industry.
 
Our Brands Have a Common Culture and Operating Philosophy
 
While each of our brands is led by separate operating teams, each shares a commitment to four core values and four dimensions of our business:
 

● | Core Values. Each brand focuses on developing behaviors and expectations around our core values, which are: Hospitality, Integrity, Respect, and Entrepreneurship.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dimensions of the Business:
--+----------------------------


o | Individual Fulfillment. Our first value speaks directly to people, whether that is fellow team members or our customers. Specific to our team members, we seek to hire people with aligned values and the appropriate knowledge and skills throughout the organization, provide them with comprehensive training programs, and provide a framework for self-directed, company-supported continuous development, as we believe that the individual fulfillment achieved from self-actualized team members with aligned values will deliver consistently superior products and service. We maintain incentive programs at all levels of management based on balanced metrics addressing performance related to people development and retention; consistent, strong operations; and superior economic value creation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Our Guests’ Emotional Connection. Rather than merely being a feeding trough for the masses, we strive to differentiate our concepts in a way that creates an emotional connection by the guest to each brand. This emotional connection drives loyalty and long-term strength in same-store-sales.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o | Operational Excellence. We are content with neither mediocrity nor the status quo, even if it is “good enough.” Rather we strive for excellence in execution, whether that is within the operations of our restaurants, or the operations of our shared services capabilities. We: (1) do things the right way, (2) take pride in our work, (3) take pride in our facilities, and (4) take pride in our brand. The pride that is shared by all of us drives us towards excellence in all of our activities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Financial Discipline and Strength. While growth is important, it needs to be sensible and bounded by financial strength. We want to achieve both growth in unit volumes and growth in number of units, but at the same time maintain a low debt load.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Brands Have Growth Potential
 
We believe both of our brands are well positioned to take advantage of consumers’ changing demands for restaurants, whether regarding the quality of the ingredients, the ability to customize their order exactly to their liking, or the ability to eat their food in a restaurant dining room, on a patio, in their car, or to either pick it up or have it delivered so they can eat it at their home or office. We believe Good Times and Bad Daddy’s are both well positioned to capitalize on those macro-trends.
 
Both of our brands currently operate with relatively small market penetration and overall development footprints, providing significant expansion potential. It is our goal to primarily grow our Bad Daddy’s brand and to do so relatively contiguously from our existing restaurants in order to maximize brand awareness and operating and distribution efficiencies.
 
Good Times and Bad Daddy’s operate with a common point-of-purchase system and we have implemented a common back-office system for both brands. We are also continuing to invest in sophisticated digital training tools, making each brand’s restaurant level processes, systems, recipes and management tools available in one commonly accessible database.
 
We Have Assembled a Dedicated Senior Leadership Team with Significant Experience
 
Each of the members of our senior leadership team have more than fifteen years of relevant experience in their field of expertise, and nearly all have more than fifteen years of industry experience, with some members having worked together for more than twenty years developing the Good Times concept. Our executive leadership team has significant experience in both full service and quick service restaurant concepts.
 
Each brand is operated with distinct operations teams led by its own operations leader, while utilizing shared support capabilities in administration, finance, accounting, human resources, development, marketing and information technology, each capability led by its own qualified leader with many years of functional and leadership experience. We believe we have people with the right expertise as well as capable processes and systems in place to support both concepts and targeted future growth of the Bad Daddy’s concept.
 
We Have Maintained Operating Momentum
 
Same-store sales at Good Times have increased ten of the past eleven years. Same-store sales increased for fiscal 2022 primarily due price increases throughout the fiscal year, partially offset by decreased foot traffic Our compound annual same-store sales growth rate was approximately 3.5% from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2022. We believe this performance is largely the result of the evolution in our brand positioning, the re-imaging of several of our older restaurants, effective management of media mix, and consistent execution of the customer experience. We plan to continue to periodically re-image and remodel our restaurants, maintain a relevant menu with a laser focus on speed and accuracy in execution, in keeping with our brand strategy, and communicate our brand story to maintain our same-store sales growth.
 
The Bad Daddy’s concept was started in 2007 in Charlotte, North Carolina by a qualified chef and was initially expanded in partnership with a serial restaurant entrepreneur who remains a non-controlling partner in five of our Bad Daddy’s restaurants. Sales of the Bad Daddy’s restaurants which were open for at least 18 months averaged $2.6 million for fiscal 2022. We purchased one previously-franchised Bad Daddy’s during the second fiscal quarter of 2022. We opened two new Bad Daddy’s restaurants during fiscal 2021 The consistency of our sales growth following the reopening of our dining rooms gives us confidence in the strength of the Bad Daddy’s concept and the ability for us to deliver upon our pre-pandemic model in a post-pandemic world, such that we expect significant long-term expansion potential, both in our existing markets and in new markets, though we expect such expansion to be disciplined and financed primarily from operating cash flow from the Bad Daddy’s business.

Business Strategies
 
We are focused on continuing to grow same store sales and improve the profitability of the Good Times concept while continuing targeted unit growth of the Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar concept in domestic markets. We believe that there are significant opportunities to develop new units, grow customer traffic and increase awareness of our brands. The following sets forth the key elements of our growth strategy:

1. | Organic sales growth in both brands. We intend to continue to focus on increasing our same-store sales. We plan to further strengthen our fresh, all-natural brand positioning at Good Times with targeted merchandising around each of our menu categories and a targeted focus on speed and accuracy in execution instead of deep discounts or exotic, limited-reach menu items. We also expect to continue various advertising programs, shifting the media mix periodically as we determine appropriate to maximize advertising effectiveness and efficiency. At Bad Daddy’s, as we emerge from the restrictions and limitations posed on us, we intend to continue to highlight our ease of access to our concept whether the dining occasion is an on-premise or off-premise format, through continued partnerships with delivery service providers, and identifying innovative ways to better reach all potential customers. We further intend to increase Bad Daddy’s same store sales through ongoing menu engineering around bold flavors and unique, concept-appropriate menu items that we believe drive increased customer visits as well as elevated per person average check. Bad Daddy’s advertising has traditionally targeted individual trade areas, community involvement and in-store, “four-wall” marketing activities that focus on optimizing the guests’ food, bar and service experience. We have enhanced those efforts by leveraging third parties who specialize in social and digital media advertising design.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Improve operational capabilities. We continue to focus on managing our expenses in the operation of our restaurants, with a particular focus on cost of sales, labor and operating expense controls and efficiencies while not adversely impacting our overall quality and service proposition. Macroeconomic, state legislative increases to wages and other external factors have resulted in upward trends in certain of these operating costs. We continue to implement programs to mitigate the impact of these external factors and continue to explore other opportunities to improve efficiency of general and administrative costs. We placed an elevated level of focus in managing overhead costs and gaining further efficiencies in supervision and support services costs and believe that those costs will be relatively stable, though we expect to invest in modern human resource and financial planning systems that will provide improved abilities for our restaurant leaders and support capability leaders to best create value for the business.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Pursue disciplined unit growth of Company-operated Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants. We own the Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar brand, including all associated intellectual property. We have identified potential new restaurant locations in the southeast U.S. market which are in various stages of negotiation. We continue to assess our development strategies and intend to follow a disciplined strategy of unit growth that may include both company-owned and franchisee-owned units. Consistent with our business dimension of Financial Discipline and Strength, we expect that growth in company-owned restaurants will remain more modest than it has been in the past and will stem from operating cash flow rather than through the use of significant debt financing to drive more rapid growth.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Expansion strategy and site selection
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar
 
Our development of the Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar concept in company-owned restaurants has focused on urban and suburban upper income demographic areas with median household incomes over $70,000, with a high concentration of daytime employment, specialty retail and entertainment venues. We use specialized software to create a sales forecast for each site and have continued to update the data in that site forecasting software even as we had limited growth during 2022. We expect to utilize this software as one component of decision making in the selection of sites for future Bad Daddy’s restaurant locations.
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar locations are primarily end-cap locations in new and existing shopping center developments using approximately 3,500 to 4,000 square feet. While our Good Times restaurants are free standing and require extensive site development and entitlement processes, Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants can be developed much more quickly due to the requirement for only a building permit, signage approvals and liquor license without the need for extensive on-site and off-site development or land and zoning submittals and modifications. We estimate that it will take approximately 120 to 150 days to develop a Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar from the time a building permit is issued. We expect that the majority of the Company’s unit growth will be through the development of additional Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar locations.
 
Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard
 
We do not have explicit plans to develop additional Good Times restaurants, as we continue to refine the economic model of our primarily drive-thru business. However, we expect that any opportunistic development in Good Times locations would be through a lens of growth in Colorado and potentially surrounding states, which would preserve operating and marketing efficiencies created by the geographic concentration of our existing base of restaurants. Any development of new Good Times restaurants would involve a new prototype restaurant design focused primarily on drive-thru with an outside patio but without any enclosed dining room.

-


We currently lease either the land or the land and building for all of our Good Times restaurants. If we were to develop additional sites, a lease/buy decision would be based upon the economics of the property and our long-term point of view on the underlying real estate and do not have an explicit preference for leasing in the case of future Good Times restaurants. Our primary site objective is to secure a suitable site, with the decision to buy or lease as a secondary objective. Our site selection process includes evaluating several criteria, including a mix of substantial daily traffic, density of at least 30,000 people within a three-mile radius, strong daytime population and employment base, retail and entertainment traffic generators, good visibility and easy access.
 
Restaurant locations
 
As of December 14, 2022, we own and operate or license a total of forty-one Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar locations. The location in the Charlotte Douglas International Airport is operated pursuant to a License Agreement. We purchased one Bad Daddy’s restaurant from a franchisee during fiscal 2022. We opened two company-owned Bad Daddy’s restaurants during fiscal 2021. We additionally had one non-traditional location in which we operated the kitchen of a local craft brewer’s taproom under the brand name Bad Daddy’s at Tivoli. This location opened in August 2021 and closed in August 2022.
 
Additionally, we own and operate or franchise a total of thirty-one Good Times restaurants. One company-owned Good Times restaurant closed due to the landlord’s purchase of the company’s remaining lease term for the purpose of redevelopment. Additionally, one company-owned Good Times restaurant closed, and the property was subleased during fiscal 2021.

Menu
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar
 
The Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar menu offers our guests a culinary-driven menu consisting of our own unique blend of high quality and handcrafted Angus beef burgers with creative, scratch-made toppings including buttermilk-fried bacon, housemade American cheese, creamy ale queso made in-house with our Bad Daddy’s Amber Ale, and our specialty signature Bad Daddy’s sauce.  The customizable menu options also include a variety of proteins including black bean, salmon, turkey, bison and chicken. Additionally, we offer giant chopped salads, a full gluten-friendly menu, appetizers including hand-cut fries and housemade potato chips, hand-spun ice cream milk shakes and our scratch-made “southern-style” banana pudding.  We feature a variety of craft beers from local breweries and a full bar serving spirits, innovative cocktails, and wines including our signature Red and White pours.
 
Our signature recipes include the Bad Ass Burger; Sam I Am Burger and Emilio’s Chicken Sandwich. Signature Chopped Salads include the Texican Chicken Salad and the Stella’s Greek Salad. However, the true differentiator for the brand is our customers’ ability to build their meal exactly the way they would like. The Bad Daddy’s Create Your Own menu allows full customization of burgers and salads offering over sixty topping options. We’ve partnered with Tivoli Brewing, a premier craft brewer in Denver, and Breckenridge Brewing, to make our Bad Daddy’s draft brews including Bad Daddy’s Amber, IPA, and Light brews. Our creative cocktail menu uses fresh-squeezed housemade sours and fresh garnishes in our signature Bad Ass Margaritas and features creative and timeless options including the Daddy’s Dragonberry and spiked milkshakes.

Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar strives to provide proprietary flavors and recipes available nowhere else with fresh, handcrafted quality throughout the menu paired with genuine and warm hospitality. We also commit to making occasional changes to keep our menu fresh for our guests while still maintaining the spirited flavor profiles that distinguish us from others. In addition, we have rotating chef specials with flavor profiles unique to Bad Daddy’s. At times we also feature a burger with local ingredients with a giveback to a local charity.
 
Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard
 
The menu of each Good Times restaurant is focused primarily on hamburgers, cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches and chicken tenders that are fresh, never frozen, and using only all-natural beef and chicken. This menu is supplemented by side selections including two types of french fries, green chile potato poppers, and onion rings. Beverages include typical soft drinks and fresh lemonades, with a selection of frozen custard products. We have a limited breakfast menu consisting of breakfast burritos, orange juice and coffee and a kid’s meal menu featuring a choice of main item, side, drink, and a wooden nickel that can be redeemed for a free kid’s cup or cone of custard.
 
Our hamburger patties are made with Meyer all-natural, all-Angus beef. Our chicken products are sourced from Springer Mountain Farms, which provides all-natural, antibiotic free, humanely-raised chicken. All-natural Angus beef and chicken are raised without the use of any hormones, antibiotics or animal byproducts that are normally used in the open market. We believe that all-natural beef and chicken deliver a better tasting product and, because of the rigorous protocols and testing that are a part of the Meyer all-natural, all-Angus Beef and Springer Mountain Farms Chicken processes, may also minimize the risk of any food-borne bacteria-related illnesses. We also believe that the use of premium, all-natural beef and chicken products help us to differentiate our concept in a crowded quick-service segment of the restaurant industry.
 
Our fresh frozen custard is a premium ice cream with a proprietary vanilla blend that is prepared from highly specialized equipment that minimizes the amount of air that is added to the mix and that creates smaller ice crystals than other frozen dairy desserts. The resulting product is smoother, creamier and thicker than typical soft serve or hard-packed ice cream products. We serve the frozen custard as vanilla and a flavor of the month in cups and cones and Spoonbenders, a mix of custard and toppings. Additionally, we offer eight flavors of shakes.
 
The breakfast menu is centered around Hatch Valley Green Chile Burritos made with our own proprietary green chile recipe using roasted green chiles sourced exclusively from Hatch Valley, New Mexico, eggs, potatoes, and cheese offered with the choice of bacon, sausage or chorizo. We also offer a premium coffee made by Daz Bog, a Colorado-based coffee roaster, and pure 100% orange juice.
 
Marketing & Advertising
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar
 
Our marketing strategy for Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar focuses on iconic, in-store merchandising materials and local store marketing to the surrounding trade area around each restaurant, including public relations and community-based events. We generally do not focus on large media buys or “traditional” advertising, but on the in-store customer experience, building word-of-mouth reputation and recommendations and local public relations based on prior and recent awards and recognitions received by Bad Daddy’s. We have recently supplemented this with additional investments in social and digital media using third party resources who specialize in highly targeted advertisements on social media and digital platforms. We also use public relations, and trade area specific direct mail materials, particularly in support of new restaurant openings, to drive trial and initial awareness.
Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard
 
Our marketing strategy for Good Times focuses on: 1) driving same store restaurant sales through attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current customers; 2) communicating specific product news and attributes to build strong points of difference from competitors; and 3) communicating a unique, strong and consistent brand personality.
 
Media is an important component of building our brand awareness and distinctiveness. We spent most of our broadcast advertising dollars on radio advertising during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. We augment our broadcast advertising with a social media presence that affords us a higher level of engagement with current customers and an increased level of product giveaways to support high sales opportunity products. As with Bad Daddy’s, we have recently supplemented our legacy advertising approach with additional investments in social and digital media using third party resources who specialize in highly targeted advertisements on social media and digital platforms.
 
Operations
 
We maintain separate operating teams for each of our concepts and have extensive operating, training and quality control systems in place.

Restaurant Management
 
Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar was developed as a chef-driven concept and utilizes a team of three or four managers in our operations at most restaurants. Managers are cross-trained in back of the house skills (prep, kitchen positions and line management), front of the house service positions (host, server and bar) and all management functions, however each manager is assigned one or more specific areas of responsibility over which they have “ownership” and direct accountability for results. Our managers at each restaurant participate in a bonus pool for each restaurant based on a combination of restaurant sales, income, and specific financial and operational objectives. As a full-service concept, our operating leadership structure for Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar operations is distinct and separate, including a separate operations leader, from our Good Times operations team as the experience, qualifications and compensation of team members are significantly different between the quick service and full-service segments of the industry. Although this is the case, we have combined recruiting into a single shared services capability and believe that long-term our training capabilities for the brands will similarly be combined into single shared services capability.
 
Each Good Times restaurant employs a general manager, generally between one and three hourly assistant managers, up to four hourly shift managers and approximately 10 to 20 non-management team members, most of whom work part-time during three shifts. Most of our shift managers, assistant managers, and general managers are internally promoted from team member positions, and in order to become a shift manager, an eight- to ten-week program over which the team member becomes fully capable on all phases of the operation, is used to train a new shift manager. Ongoing training and development is provided as necessary. We believe that incentive compensation of our restaurant managers is essential to the success of our business. Accordingly, our general managers and assistant managers in each restaurant participate in a bonus program based upon meeting financial, customer service and quality performance objectives tied to a monthly scorecard of measures.
 
Operational and Management Systems and Processes
 
We have implemented highly-effective operating systems and processes relative to those in the industry for both of our concepts. Detailed processes have been developed for all responsibilities that drive consistency across our system of restaurants and performance against our standards within different day parts. We utilize a combination of industry-leading labor programs and proprietary algorithms to determine optimal staffing needs of each restaurant based on its actual customer flow and demand. We also employ several additional operational tools to continuously monitor and improve speed of service, food waste, food quality, sanitation, financial performance and employee development. The order system at each Good Times restaurant is equipped with an internal timing device that displays and records the time each order takes to prepare and deliver.
 
We use several sources of customer feedback to evaluate each restaurant’s service and quality performance, including an extensive secret shopper program, telephone surveys, website comments and a customer feedback tool that aggregates all social media comments as well as store-by-store surveys each week for each restaurant. We believe that information will assist us in evaluating opportunities for improved execution of the customer experience.
 
Training
 
We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants for both Good Times and Bad Daddy’s through the careful training and supervision of our restaurant leadership team members and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation and maintenance of our restaurants. Each manager must complete an eight- to ten-week training program, be certified on several core processes and is then closely supervised to show both comprehension and capability before they are allowed to manage autonomously. We have a defined weekly and monthly goal-setting process around service, employee development, financial management and store maintenance goals for every restaurant. Additionally, we have a library of video training tools to drive training efficiencies and consistency at both brands.
 
Prior to opening a new restaurant, a training and opening team travels to the new restaurant location to prepare for an intensive training program for all team members hired for the new restaurant opening. Part of the training team remains on-site for a period after the opening of the restaurant while an additional team provides several weeks of support following opening.
 
Recruiting and Retention
 
At Bad Daddy’s we seek to hire experienced restaurant managers and operating partners. We support employees by offering competitive wages and benefits, including a matching 401(k) plan, medical insurance, and incentive plans at every level of management that are tied to performance against key goals and objectives. We motivate and prepare our employees by providing them with opportunities for increased responsibilities and advancement. We also provide various other incentives, including paid time off, communication allowances, incentive performance bonuses and referral bonuses. We have implemented an online screening and hiring tool that has proven to reduce hourly employee turnover.

Franchising
 
For Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar, we have prepared forms of area rights and franchise agreements. We anticipate that a franchisee will typically pay a royalty of 4% to 5% of net sales and will participate in an advertising fund and local advertising by contributing up to 2% of net sales. Initial development and franchise fees are projected to be $35,000 per restaurant. We estimate that it will cost a Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar franchisee $590,000 to $1,382,000 to open a 3,500 to 4,000 square foot restaurant in an in-line or end-cap retail center, based on our knowledge of the development costs of the existing Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants. We are not currently actively soliciting new franchisees but are assessing potential future growth through the development of franchised Bad Daddy’s restaurants.
 
For Good Times, we have previously prepared forms of area rights and franchise agreements and advertising material to be utilized in soliciting prospective franchisees. We have historically sought to attract franchisees that are experienced restaurant operators, are well capitalized and have demonstrated the ability to develop one to five restaurants.  We review sites selected for franchises and monitor performance of franchise units. Currently, we are not actively soliciting new franchisees but are assessing potential future growth through the development of franchised Good Times restaurants.
 
We currently have one license agreement for a Bad Daddy’s location in the Charlotte Douglas International Airport. We currently have six Good Times restaurants operating under franchise agreements in the greater Denver metropolitan area and two dual-branded franchised restaurants operate in Wyoming. In addition, seven joint-venture restaurants are operating in the Denver metropolitan area media market.
 
We actively work with and monitor our franchisees to ensure successful franchise operations as well as compliance with our systems and procedures. We advise the franchisee on menu, management training and marketing. On an ongoing basis we conduct standards reviews of all franchise restaurants in key areas including product quality, service standards, restaurant cleanliness and sanitation and food safety.
 
Management Information Systems
 
The systems in our restaurants are designed in a manner to minimize the amount of time our managers spend on administrative tasks. We utilize up-to-date versions of a leading point-of-sale system in each of our company-owned restaurants that captures transaction-level data required to support information about sales, product mix, and average check. Configuration of restaurant point-of-sales systems is performed by our technology share service capability.
 
We use a cloud-based back-office solution across both brands that collects sales, labor and cash data from the restaurant point-of-sale system in near real-time and is the primary source of capture for inventory and supply chain management information. This back-office solution interfaces with our primary financial accounting systems and provides all levels of management with relevant daily, weekly and monthly reports across substantially all store-level income and expense categories.
 
Food Preparation, Quality Control & Purchasing
 
We believe that we have excellent food quality standards relative to the industry. Our systems are designed to protect our food supply throughout the preparation process. We inspect specific qualified manufacturers and work together with those manufacturers to provide specifications and quality controls. Our operations management teams are trained in a nationally recognized comprehensive safety and sanitation course specific to food service. Minimum cook temperature requirements, periodic line checks throughout the day, and daily facilities checklists ensure the safety and quality of both burgers and other items we use in our restaurants.
 
We currently purchase 100% of the food and paper supplies for our Good Times restaurants and the majority of the food and paper supplies for our Bad Daddy’s restaurants from US Foods. In addition, we maintain multiple approved suppliers for all key components of our menu to mitigate risk and ensure supply. Suppliers are chosen based upon their ability to provide (i) a continuous supply of product that meets all safety and quality specifications, (ii) logistics expertise and freight management, (iii) product innovation and differentiation, (iv) customer service, (v) transparency of business relationships and (vi) competitive pricing. Specified products are distributed to all restaurants through US Foods under negotiated contracts directly to our restaurants two to four times per week depending on restaurant requirements. We do not believe that the current reliance on these distributors will have any long-term material adverse effect since we believe that there are a sufficient number of other suppliers from which food and paper supplies could be purchased with little or no interruption in service. We do not anticipate any difficulty in continuing to obtain an adequate quantity of food and paper supplies of acceptable quality and at acceptable prices. We monitor the primary commodities we purchase and extend contract positions when applicable in order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in price and availability. However, certain commodities, primarily ground beef, remain subject to market price fluctuations.

Employees
 
At September 27, 2022, we had approximately 2,411 active employees of which 2,194 are hourly team members and 217 are salaried managers or professional staff working full time. Our set of values includes Respect and Care for people, including all of our employees, and one of the dimensions of our business is Individual Fulfillment. We strive to provide competitive salary and benefits, strong development opportunities, and a meaningful job or career for all of our employees and believe that this has translated into good employee relations. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Competition
 
The restaurant industry, including both limited service and full-service segments, is highly competitive. Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar competes with both local, regional, and national gourmet, “better burger” concepts as well as more legacy grill and bar concepts.  As such, Bad Daddy’s competes with both full-service and limited-service better burger restaurants. There are other burger-centric fast casual concepts that operate at a lower average customer check than Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar and others in both fast casual and full-service formats that operate with a higher average customer check. We believe that we offer sufficient price choice to be able to compete effectively in the full range of such concepts. We believe that Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar has an advantage in the premium quality of our ingredients, unparalleled ability for guests to customize their order, distinctiveness of its atmosphere and the bold, unique flavors of our scratch-made, chef-inspired menu offerings. Nevertheless, Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar may be at a competitive disadvantage to other restaurant chains with greater name recognition and operating mass.
 
Good Times competes with many other hamburger-oriented quick-service restaurants in the areas in which it operates. Many of these restaurants are owned and operated by regional and national restaurant chains, many of which have greater financial resources and experience than we do. In-N-Out, a California-based, burger-focused quick-service restaurant concept, has expanded into the Colorado market and Whataburger, a Texas-based burger-focused quick-service restaurant concept has announced its intent to expand into the Colorado market. Double drive-thru restaurant chains such as Rally’s Hamburgers and Checker’s Drive-In Restaurants, which currently operate double drive-thru restaurants in various markets in the United States, are not currently operating in Colorado. We are aware of only two significant quick-service competitors offering frozen custard as a primary menu item operating in the Colorado market and both have a significant presence in Midwestern markets that may be targeted for expansion. Additional “fast casual” hamburger restaurants are being developed in the Colorado market; however, these generally do not have drive-thru service and generate an average per person check that is meaningfully higher than the average check at a Good Times restaurant.
 
We believe that Good Times may have a competitive advantage in terms of quality of product compared to traditional quick-service hamburger chains. Early development of our double drive-thru concept in Colorado has given us an advantage over other drive-thru chains that may seek to expand into Colorado because of our brand awareness and present restaurant locations. Nevertheless, we may be at a competitive disadvantage to other restaurant chains with greater name recognition and marketing capability. Furthermore, most of our competitors in the fast-food business operate more restaurants, have been established longer, and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do. There is also active competition for management personnel, as well as for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have registered our marks “Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar” and “Good Times” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We received approval of our federal registration of “Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar” in 2011 and “Good Times” in 2003. Additionally, we own trademarks or service marks that have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office including, but not limited to, “Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar EST. 2007”, “Big Daddy Bacon Cheeseburger,” “Spoonbender”, and “Happiness Made To Order”.  The registration for our “Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar” mark will be renewed prior to September 2031. The registration for our “Good Times” marks will be renewed prior to December 2023 and March 2032 respectively. We intend to maintain our marks and renew registrations on a timely basis.
Government Regulation
 
Each of our restaurants is subject to the regulations of various health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant. Federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations. More stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations. We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime, and other working conditions. In addition, we are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires restaurants and other facilities open to the public to provide for access and use of facilities by the handicapped. Management believes that we are in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Beginning in 2015, we became subject to the Affordable Care Act which requires us to have the required health insurance benefits for eligible employees.

We are also subject to federal and state laws regulating franchise operations, which vary from registration and disclosure requirements in the offer and sale of franchises to the application of statutory standards regulating franchise relationships. Many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreements, including limitations on non-competition provisions and the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Some states require that franchise materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in that state.
 
In addition, each Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurant requires a liquor license and adherence to the attendant laws and requirements regulating the serving and consumption of alcohol. Alcoholic beverage control regulations govern various aspects of these restaurants’ daily operations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control, handling and storage. Typically, licenses to sell alcoholic beverages require annual renewal and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, the definition of which varies by locality.
