--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2


 
• | our geographic, end market and product diversification.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 Our diversified profile today best positions us for stability and leading market performance through all phases of an economic cycle.
 Our Industry
 We compete in the highly fragmented market of contract manufacturers, the majority of which are small local players that are limited in scale, capabilities and technology. Many of these local manufacturers have single or limited production capabilities and provide niche components in specific geographic markets. Accordingly, there are a limited number of competitors in the contract manufacturing market in which we operate with the capacity and expertise to deliver the full range of solutions we offer. For example, our diverse manufacturing capabilities across product lines have contributed to us being the recipient of The Fabricator’s “FAB 40” #1 Largest Fabricator in the attractive U.S. markets for the past eleven years in a row (2011 – 2021). While we compete with certain manufacturers across selected product lines, we believe that no single manufacturer directly competes with us across our full offering and end market applications.
 Our end market diversification coupled with our extensive product breadth allows us to maintain financial stability as individual end markets fluctuate. The primary end markets we serve include heavy- and medium-duty commercial vehicles, construction & access equipment, powersports, agriculture, and military, among other machinery markets. As markets strengthen or weaken, our output is redirected and realigned to support ongoing change. Further, as these fluctuations affect the market, we are favorably positioned to benefit from the broader trend of our OEM customers to consolidate to fewer and more sophisticated suppliers in order to improve quality and delivery while lowering the total cost of doing business. This consolidation trend will allow us to grow and protects our cash flow as markets change and shift.
 We have also experienced, and benefitted from, an OEM trend of seeking to improve their strategy execution and simplify their business through outsourcing. Based on our history, OEMs pursue a strategy that focuses on core component market differentiation, such as structural frames and complete powertrain assemblies, and prefer to outsource the remaining product components to third parties rather than manufacturing them in-house. This is done in order to maintain their strategic focus, drive cost savings and reduce their own investment in manufacturing, thereby allowing them to focus on the most important aspects of their value creation process, namely product design and development, final product assembly and testing, branding, sales, marketing and distribution. While each specific OEM differs in its strategy, we see this trend continuing as customers deal with workforce constraints and look for optimum return on investments and improving cash flow. Moreover, our OEM customers focus on the production of the core components of their products, which leads them to rely on outsourced providers like us for the remaining components of their finished product needs. We believe we will benefit from this continued shift in our customers’ focus and ongoing desire for OEMs to improve efficiencies, reduce costs and simplify supply chains. Our established and embedded relationships, breadth of capabilities and scalability will allow us to simplify the supply chain process for our customers by acting as a single point of contact in the supply chain. In addition, we believe OEMs are increasingly favoring platforms supported by larger, more sophisticated and financially stable suppliers with the ability to serve large national and international operations all while maintaining a local touch. Our extensive manufacturing footprint, competitive cost structure and integrated design, engineering, production planning and quality program management capabilities positions us favorably to take advantage of these opportunities and trends.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that customers turn to us for their manufacturing needs because we are the ultimate “ReSource”. ReSource is a dual-purpose acronym we use to describe the breadth of our capabilities and our goal to be the one-stop solution allowing customers to re-source all of their fabrication needs through us. We collaborate with our customers to generate a strategic alignment and position ourselves as an essential part of our customers’ product development and manufacturing process by drawing on our deep product and engineering knowledge to deliver best-in-class solutions. We offer a broad portfolio of end-to-end solutions comprised of advanced and innovative processes and capabilities that enhance quality and simplify supply chains. We are focused on producing the highest quality components using complex processes at the lowest cost by working with customers throughout the product design and development process to establish optimal solutions. Our engineering expertise and technical know-how allows us to add value through every product redevelopment cycle (generally every three to five years for our customers).
 Value-Added Supply Chain Partner with Embedded Relationships. Our embedded relationships with our large and diverse customer base are driven by the P.R.I.D.E. (“Personal Responsibility In Daily Excellence”) approach our employees take in their work, which emphasizes the highest quality and performance in all facets of our business, including our ability to partner with our customers and deliver to them complex solutions across a wide range of products. Our unique, end-to-end offering provides solutions throughout the life cycle of a product, including upfront product manufacturability advice and prototyping, production volumes and aftermarket components. We strive to maintain operation alignment (and continuous re-alignment) with our customers’ strategy and production activities as they evolve, allowing us to remain agile in response to market changes, while enabling our customers to be successful, and to remain adaptable to changes in customer needs to retain flexibility to adjust appropriately. Together, these items comprise “The MEC Mission.” Our focus on collaboration with our customers and our breadth of capabilities also generates strategic

alignment with our customers, resulting in sticky relationships, driving vendor reduction and providing other ancillary benefits such as optimization of working capital investments. Our track record of engineering expertise has resulted in our consistent inclusion in customer design and prototyping activities, enabling customers to view us as an invaluable extension of their own teams. In turn, this collaboration allows our customers to focus on the development of their core technologies and products. Our position as a deeply embedded supply chain partner of scale allows us to provide a multitude of solutions, driving strong customer relationships with high switching costs.
 Leading and Defendable Market Position in Attractive North American Market. According to the Fabricator, we have been ranked as the largest fabricator in the United States for the past eleven years in a row (2011 – 2021). The market is highly fragmented and characterized by high barriers to entry given the complex nature of the work, established relationships, and high customer switching costs. While there are numerous competitors in the markets in which we operate, few maintain the product breadth, manufacturing capabilities, scale or engineering expertise that we do. Our depth of capabilities allows us to offer our customers:

• | low volume production capability;
--+----------------------------------


• | customized and sophisticated solutions;
--+----------------------------------------


• | unique engineering and manufacturing capabilities throughout the product lifecycle;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | critical scale to service large national and regional customers as well as local customers; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability to act as a single point of contact and offer seamless customer service.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 End Market and Customer Diversification. Our value-added manufacturing focus enables us to remain diversified across a variety of customer end markets, including heavy- and medium-duty commercial vehicles, construction & access equipment, powersports, agriculture, and military, among others. These end markets are representative of our globally recognized customers, which are comprised of large OEM manufacturers. In 2021, our top customer and top ten customers accounted for 16.6% and 79.6% of net sales, respectively, which collectively represents hundreds of platforms that we serve across a variety of end markets and customer operating segments. Our access to a multitude of end markets allows us to strategically shift focus to sell into current opportunities as end market demand evolves. In addition to customer and end market diversification, our customers themselves are also diversified across multiple end markets. For example, John Deere is one of our leading customers with 2021 net sales accounting for 16.6% of our total net sales, to whom we provide over 5,000 SKUs across over 60 individual John Deere platforms including the agriculture, forestry, turf care, power systems and construction & access equipment end markets. Our increasingly stable performance is a direct result of our intentional business design of agility and adaptability to realign manufacturing capacities to serve diversified and ever-changing end markets.

Further, our unique combination of manufacturing processes allows us to opportunistically target sophisticated, higher margin business. The diversity of our offering has provided our Company with financial stability through various end market and economic cycles.
 Technology-Enabled Infrastructure. We continue to invest in a technology-enabled asset base that provides significant flexible and re-deployable capacity to support our planned growth, increases profitability, efficiency, quality and employee safety, reduces spend on energy and drives a long-term cost advantage over our competitors. We have leveraged our purchasing power to make significant investments in operational infrastructure throughout our history, in items such as flexible and re-deployable automation and capacity improvements to improve throughput, quality and consistency. For example, we were one of the first in our industry to adopt fiber lasers and have continued to invest in this capability. We have implemented 10,000- and 12,000-watt fiber lasers with an automation tower, which are on average three times faster, provide a cleaner, more precise cut and use one-third of the power compared to traditional CO2 lasers, with a payback period of less than two years. Additionally, the implementation of robotic brakes has improved quality through a continued shift towards precision automation. By reducing setup procedures, manual employee lifting requirements and downtime while offering additional capacity, the implementation of robotic brakes has resulted in a payback period of approximately two years. These two examples of investments in technology-enabled infrastructure allow us to reallocate our workforce, as employees can be retrained and redeployed into more technically skilled positions. In today’s ever-changing labor market, the ability to redeploy labor to increase flexibility and capacity for our customers is of utmost importance and interest as part of our strategy. Our investments in continuous improvement and automation have driven operational efficiencies and improved metric tracking allowing our management team to more effectively run the business and improve the value we provide to our customers. We have, from time-to-time, made strategic, customer-driven investments that directly support new product and market expansion which result in further competitive advantages and higher switching costs for our customers.

Cost Structure and Operational Excellence. We have reduced our exposure to commodity price risk by structuring our customer contracts to pass through changes in commodity prices. As such, we have been able to effectively limit any potential impact from tariffs and commodity price volatility to our margins. Our scale and profitability have also allowed us the flexibility to implement continuous improvement initiatives in driving efficiencies, such as automation and additional capacity, which will result in long-term efficiency and margin improvements, and expanded capabilities.
Our Strategy
 Achieve Sales Growth Through Organic Expansion. We believe there is ample opportunity to achieve deeper penetration of existing customers and to win new customers with our strong one-stop offerings. By leveraging our core product capabilities to expand into new markets, and establishing new offerings in attractive, adjacent or complementary platforms through new product introductions, there is significant opportunity to execute on our organic growth initiatives. Expanding our wallet share with our customers by capturing a wider variety of products and more platforms both solidifies our relationship with customers (because it increases customer switching costs) and attracts potential new customers that seek to simplify supply chains, while also defending our market position from our competitors. These opportunities are enhanced through cross selling between MEC’s capabilities and customer base. Our expertise allows us to produce higher quality components at cost-effective rates while our volume, equipment and know-how establish competitive advantages. Further, an expanded offering increases our strategic alignment with customers and supports our “We Make Things Simple” value proposition by presenting customers with further vendor consolidation opportunities.
 Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions. Our management team maintains a proven track record of successfully executing and integrating strategic acquisitions. We have completed two significant acquisitions since 2012 (Center Mfg. Co. in 2012 and Defiance Metal Products (DMP) in December 2018) and four other complementary acquisitions since 2004, which have contributed new capabilities, product offerings, end markets served, and technologies to our legacy business, along with significant synergy opportunities that have enhanced our financial position. Our strategy is to continue to identify, and opportunistically execute on, accretive acquisitions that will allow our Company to achieve further growth. We believe that our reputation, scale and track record of performance makes us a “consolidator of choice” among industry participants, which has led to an ample pipeline of actionable acquisition opportunities. Our investment criteria for acquisitions are U.S.-based companies with long-standing customer bases comprised of leading OEMs, and specialized manufacturing capabilities that allows us to enhance our existing expertise or expand into new types of capabilities, among other criteria. It is our view that continued execution of our acquisition strategy provides significant opportunity to generate shareholder value through further consolidation of our fragmented industry. The market environment, comprised mainly of small local and regional players, provides ample add-on acquisition opportunities to bolster our one-stop shop approach to broadly serving our customers. Beyond our existing served markets, we see potential acquisition opportunities within the rail, aerospace, medical, fitness, energy, heavy fabrication and food & beverage end markets, among others.
 Continue Process-Driven Improvement Initiatives. Our process-driven improvement initiatives have resulted in significant savings throughout our history, leading to improved financial results and positive customer outcomes. Our strategy will continue to include a keen focus on continuous improvements in order to maintain a differentiated and defendable market-leading position, as well as ongoing costs and operating improvements including investments in technology and automation, plant consolidations, and acquisition integration synergies, which are expected to drive immediate and long-term productivity and margin improvements through permanent headcount reductions. Examples of recent process driven improvement plans include:

• | successful integration of new 10,000- and 12,000-watt fiber lasers, robotic brake presses, and automated material handling equipment in Mayville, WI and Defiance, OH;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Maintain Alignment with Employee Base and Employee-Driven Results. Our rich history of employee ownership and P.R.I.D.E has cultivated a strategic management-employee alignment and results-driven organization with each employee contributing to a common goal. Our employees maintain a significant ownership stake since our IPO, which we believe benefits the entire organization as our strategic alignment remains in place and continues to generate employee-driven results. As we continue to invest in our business and increasingly implement a more technology-enabled infrastructure, we will strive to redeploy our employees in other, higher-skilled areas of our business and invest in training where needed. Our employees are the foundation of our company; with experience across a diverse range of markets and capabilities, they drive innovation, believe in our process and the outcomes of their work and our success. Our investment in new technology attracts technically savvy employees to replace retiring traditionally skilled employees. We and our employees are also highly involved in, and actively support, the communities in which our facilities are located; our 2,200 employees take P.R.I.D.E. in creating value and support for both our customers and communities every day.

Our Proven Approach 
 We collaborate with our customers to generate a strategic alignment and position ourselves as an essential part of our customers’ product development and manufacturing process by drawing on our deep product and engineering knowledge to deliver best-in-class solutions. Our approach is simple: we view quality as a significant business strategy with a strong return on investment. Our philosophy on quality is based on Continuous Improvement with an IATF (international automotive task force) and ISO (international organization for standardization) foundation. Our skilled and experienced staff is highly trained in areas of quality planning, metrology, geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (ASME Y14.5M 1994), ISO, QS9000, statistical techniques (SPC) and ISO 14001 certifications. Our Quality Management System is comprised of the following:

• | IATF 16949:2016 certification (one of the automotive industry’s most widely used international standards for quality management);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ISO 9001:2015 registration (international standard for quality management systems);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | process and assembly line audits with focus on process control;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | process capability that is proven at validation and monitored during production; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | specialized validations for paint and weld operations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 We periodically enter into joint process improvement efforts with key customers. Such exercises have historically resulted in reduced manufacturing critical path time, cost reductions and quality improvements through effective batch sizes and more repeatable processes. Our continuous improvement initiatives have resulted in the acquisition and application of state-of-the-art technologies and plant improvements that support lean, quick response manufacturing flexibility that put us at the forefront of our market. Moreover, the agility that our quick response manufacturing methodology provides us keeps our purchasing, manufacturing, engineering and quality teams on the cutting edge of flexible manufacturing. This adaptable approach also decreases manufacturing costs, allows for faster order turnaround times, and elimination of excess waste.
 We maintain an advanced machinery portfolio in our facilities that allow us to leverage our employee workforce with state-of-the-art capabilities and functionality. We strive to maintain our assets or upgrade capabilities where deterioration has driven obsolescence or better technology is available, reducing our carbon footprint. Most recently, we have invested in multiple fiber laser systems and robotic brake presses with automation aimed at reducing labor content and optimizing floor space which allows us to generate more revenue with the same workforce and footprint. We have also recently invested in a machining center with palletizers, leading edge tube lasers with automatic loaders, robotic brake presses, robotic weld cells and a direct-to-metal paint line.
 Our Markets 
 Our primary end markets include (but are not limited to) the heavy- and medium-duty commercial vehicles, construction & access equipment, powersports, agriculture, and military markets. While our individual end markets may be exposed to cyclical variations, the diversified nature of our end markets affords us the ability to shift production with demand as certain end markets trend lower and others trend higher. In our experience, our diversification has muted the impact of downturns on our business that we have faced in the past. For example, we experienced net sales growth during the 2008 and 2009 recessions due to strong orders, particularly from our customers focused on the military end market. Moreover, as our heavy- and medium-duty commercial vehicles, construction & access equipment, powersports, and agriculture customers’ revenues fluctuated from 2013 to 2017, with median peak-to-trough sales decline of 23%, our peak-to-trough sales declines were less than that of those respective markets at only 10%. We were able to accomplish this by reallocating our resources to serve our heavy- and medium-duty commercial vehicles and powersports customers, leading to strong double-digit growth in those end markets.

• | Heavy- and Medium-Duty Commercial Vehicles: Heavy-duty commercial vehicles include class 8 heavy trucks such as standard semi-trucks. Medium-duty commercial vehicles include classes 3-7 trucks such as box trucks;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Customers
 We are a critical and deeply embedded supply partner with strong strategic alignment and relationships with our customers. We have developed long-standing business relationships with our OEM customers, many of which span decades. Further, we are diversified by customers and end markets with net sales attributed to our top 20 customers accounting for $406 million of 2021 net sales, and no single end market accounting for more than 34% of net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2021, John Deere, PACCAR Inc., AB Volvo and Honda accounted for 16.6%, 14.1%, 10.8% and 10.0% of net sales, respectively. We have not historically experienced customer attrition given high customer switching costs resulting from our embedded relationships driven by our broad capabilities and scale.
Raw Materials and Manufactured Components
 Our purchases primarily include steel and aluminum. We maintain a broad and diverse base of over 1,000 suppliers. Our established relationships provide efficient and flexible access to resources and redundancy to ensure support of our customers. We have no history of material supply issues or outages. In 2021, no single supplier represented more than 16% of our total purchases and 98% of the raw materials we purchased were sourced from domestic suppliers. Our suppliers are strategically located in order to maximize efficiencies and minimize shipping costs, although switching costs are minimal and we maintain a multitude of alternative suppliers that we could transfer orders to, if needed. We have structured our customer contracts to pass through commodity price changes, which has allowed us to remain mostly unaffected by the recent raw material price volatility and tariffs. As we continue to grow, we intend to leverage our size and scale to further reduce material costs.
Sales and Marketing
 We have a strong sales team comprised of approximately 50 experienced professionals responsible for managing and expanding client relationships, and proactively pursuing new opportunities. Sales personnel are aligned by market segment and customer, including heavy- and medium-duty commercial vehicles, construction & access equipment, powersports, agriculture, military and other end markets, and employ a highly technical and collaborative sales process with deep knowledge of our customers and capabilities. Sales personnel have assigned support teams comprised of inside sales, marketing, and sales administration personnel. We are consistently involved in request for proposal processes, where our sales teams with deep process expertise collaborate with customers on optimal designs for manufacturability and manufacturing efficiency. The upfront collaboration drives formalization of product specifications, program lifecycle planning, cost estimates and risk mitigation. The sales process typically takes 3 – 18 months and ultimately ends in the implementation of product lifecycle timelines and purchase orders under long-term customer arrangements. The sales team utilizes systems infrastructure that effectively track and manage backlogs, quotes and bookings information, strategic projects and call reports, all of which are reviewed at weekly sales team meetings.
Information Systems
 We utilize standardized information technology systems across all areas of quoting and estimating, enterprise resource planning, materials resource planning, capacity planning and accounting for enhanced procurement of work, project execution and financial controls. We provide information technology oversight and support from our corporate headquarters in Mayville, WI. The operational information systems we employ throughout our company are industry specific applications that in some cases have been internally or vendor modified and improved to fit our operations. Our enterprise resource planning software is integrated with our operational information systems wherever possible to deliver relevant, real-time operational data to designated personnel. Accounting and operations personnel of acquired companies are trained not only by our information technology support staff, but by long- tenured employees in our organization with extensive experience using our systems. We believe our information systems provide our people with the tools to execute their individual job function and achieve our strategic initiatives.
Our Competition
 We participate in a highly fragmented market with competitors in each of the end markets we serve ranging in size from small companies focused on a single capability or end market, to large multi-disciplinary companies. While there can be instances of intense competition from specific end markets, we believe that we have been able to effectively compete, and maintain competitive advantages on the basis of our:

• | scale and product offering with the ability to cross-sell and provide our customers with a one-stop solution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | broad manufacturing capability and flexibility to fulfill requests that require complex solutions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer service with our highly skilled and knowledgeable workforce able to provide consultative advice; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regionalized geographic focus provides a defensible position from both foreign and domestic competitors as our customers continue to take a regionalized approach to production, which provides a shorter supply chain with greater flexibility.

Our Human Capital Management
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,200 full-time employees, approximately 1,725 of whom are production employees, none of which are unionized.
  We maintain an experienced and skilled workforce. We have been highly focused on attracting and retaining high quality personnel as they represent a critical factor in our continued success. Despite the recent market challenges in the hiring of trade-skilled employees, our continued investment in newer technologies and capabilities has allowed us to opportunistically re-train and redeploy certain roles that were previously human capital-intensive, and re-train and repurpose employees into other areas of the company. On average, our employees have approximately seven years of service with us.
 We believe we maintain strong relationships with our employees and believe they are aligned with our employee-owned mindset through our ESOP and annual discretionary profit-sharing programs. We offer our employees competitive compensation and comprehensive benefit packages, annually benchmarking them against comparable industries in the same geographic vicinity to where our facilities are located. Further enhancing our benefit offerings, we provide an on-site healthcare team at certain facilities to treat work and non-work related injuries and assist employees with general wellness and overall well-being.
 The safety, health and well-being of our employees is one of the Company’s top priorities. Our “Work MEC Safe” program creates a strong safety culture based on five key elements: Inspire, Lead, Analyze, Educate and Recognize. These elements lay the foundation for establishing an employee voice in daily operations, ensuring safety ownership from those in leadership roles, identifying workplace hazards through routine inspections, audits and observations, training employees to identify and mitigate risks and prevent injuries, and developing avenues to continue enhancing the importance of safety in the workplace.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken steps at all locations across the U.S to limit the risk of exposure. These actions include continuous communication emphasizing personal hygiene best practices, providing hand sanitizer and masks for all employees, implementing additional cleansing and sanitizing processes in all our workstations and common areas, and providing on-site testing at certain facilities. Additionally, our employees are able to socially distance naturally to some extent as a result of being separated by their respective work cells.
 Environmental Matters
 We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to manufacturing, handling and disposal of materials into the environment. We believe that our environmental control procedures are adequate.
