We also operate or partner with numerous warehouse and distribution facilities in our global markets to service the needs of our customers. In addition, we have select manufacturer representatives' warehouses located in specific geographic areas to serve local customers.
We derive a significant portion of revenue from our OEM customers. In our HVAC business, a large portion of our sales are to key OEM customers which makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business. We have long standing relationships with these customers and we expect these customer relationships will continue for the foreseeable future. Despite this relative concentration, we had no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019.
Many of our motors are incorporated into residential applications that OEMs sell to end users. The number of installations of new and replacement HVAC systems, pool pumps and related components is higher during the spring and summer seasons due to the increased use of air conditioning and swimming pools during warmer months. As a result, our revenues tend to be higher in the second and third quarters.

As of January 1, 2022, our backlog was $1,214.5 million, as compared to $444.8 million on January 2, 2021. We believe that virtually all of our backlog will be shipped in fiscal 2022.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We own a number of US patents and foreign patents relating to our businesses. While we believe that our patents provide certain competitive advantages, we do not consider any one patent or group of patents essential to our business as a whole. We also use various registered and unregistered trademarks, and we believe these trademarks are significant in the marketing of most of our products. However, we believe the successful manufacture and sale of our products generally depends more upon our technological, manufacturing and marketing skills.
Human Capital Management
At the end of fiscal 2021, we employed approximately 30,000 full-time associates worldwide. Of those associates, approximately 13,000 were located in Mexico; approximately 6,000 in the US; approximately 3,000 in China; approximately 3,000 in India; and approximately 5,000 in the rest of the world. 
We feel that our associates are our most valuable assets and consider our associate relations to be very good. Our objective is to create a high-performing organization by attracting and retaining high-quality, diverse talent and creating an environment in which all associates have the opportunity to reach their full potential. 
The core goal of our performance management process is to develop and maintain a high-performing organization that is positioned to meet our business objectives. Creating a high-performing organization requires associates and managers to exhibit transparency in their day-to-day interactions, and use data to drive decision-making and accountability. Our performance management process focuses on enabling associates and managers to gain alignment through:
•a structured annual goal-setting process where managers and associates work collaboratively to develop specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time bound (SMART) goals that align with our overarching business objectives and our company values;
•clear, organization-wide expectations that managers and associates monitor progress toward completion of their SMART goals with regular coaching sessions and periodic evaluations; and
•an annual performance assessment that provides a direct link between the associate’s pay and performance.
In addition to our focus on performance, we also have a strong commitment to our company values of integrity, responsibility, diversity and inclusion, customer success, innovation with purpose, continuous improvement, performance, and a passion to win, all with a sense of urgency. We regularly promote these values from the top down. In addition to instilling our corporate values as a key part of associate life, we promote a commitment to ethics and compliance among our workforce through our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (our "Code"). In 2021, 94.5% of our global workforce (including employees, temporary employees and contractors), completed training on our Code during our annual training period. Our annual training period for 2021 occurred before the Rexnord and Automation Solutions transactions closed during the fourth quarter, so the new associates who joined the Company as part of those transactions are not included in our data. 
As mentioned above, diversity and inclusion are rooted in our company values. We believe that we are at our best when we bring to bear the unique perspectives, experiences, backgrounds and ideas of our associates. We seek a workforce that reflects the communities in which we operate, and strive to create diverse, equal and inclusive workplaces where all of our associates have the opportunity to achieve their full potential. In 2021, as a sign of our commitment to this goal, we joined the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, which is the largest CEO-driven organization committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and also signed the National Association of Manufacturers Pledge for Action to cement our commitment to advancing justice, equality and opportunity for all people of color.
We are also committed to improving the health and well-being of our associates. Our US wellness program was established in 2008 and is continuously evolving to better educate, motivate and reward our associates for maintaining and achieving healthy measures. During our wellness plan year running from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021, 52% of our US associates 
participated in on-site biometric screening that provides them with key metrics such as BMI, blood pressure, and triglyceride, cholesterol and blood glucose levels. This represents an increase of 17% compared with our prior wellness plan year.
As a company, we believe that our value of responsibility requires community engagement, and we encourage our associates to share in our commitment to the communities where we operate. We have an established charitable foundation, which is governed by an advisory board comprised of our associates. In 2021, the Company and the Company's Charitable Foundation contributed $1,083,100 to charitable organizations, up from $570,481 in 2020. In 2021, the Charitable Foundation realigned its giving philosophy to support charitable organizations in more of the communities where our associates live and work globally. Whereas the Charitable Foundation previously focused primarily on supporting charitable organizations in the US, the amount we contributed internationally in 2021 (predominately in Mexico given the high concentration of our associates there) represented approximately 40% of our overall contributions.

In addition, we have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our officers, directors and associates which satisfies the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange regarding a “code of business conduct.” We have also adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines addressing the subjects required by the New York Stock Exchange. In September 2021, we produced our updated Sustainability Report. We make copies of the foregoing, as well as the charters of our Board committees, available free of charge on our website. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirements under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding amendments to, or waivers from, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by posting such information on our web site at the address stated above. We are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
