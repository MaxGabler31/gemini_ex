Product Candidates 
ANA001: Treatment of COVID-19 Symptoms
ANA001, NeuroBo’s lead drug candidate, is a proprietary oral niclosamide formulation and is being developed as a treatment for patients with moderate COVID-19 (patients not requiring ventilators). Niclosamide is a potential oral antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent with a long history of use and documented safety in humans. ANA001 is currently being studied in a 60-subject Phase 2 clinical trial being conducted at up to 10 clinical sites in the United States. Niclosamide has demonstrated both antiviral and immunomodulatory activity with possible downstream effects on coagulation abnormalities observed in COVID-19. In preclinical research by an independent academic group published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, niclosamide inhibited viral replication in vitro and was more potent than remdesivir and chloroquine in the same assay.
Specifically, studies have shown niclosamide prevents replication of SARS-CoV-2 at very low concentrations and that the compound appears to exhibit three distinct mechanisms of action: 1) acting as a potent antiviral to a broad homology of other viruses including influenza; 2) reducing inflammation without suppressing the immune system; and 3) providing bronchodilation, which is a useful pulmonary mechanism for at-risk patients with underlying cardiovascular and/or pulmonary conditions.
As a result, the Company believes ANA001 has the potential to reduce the viral load and inflammation associated with cytokine dysregulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and coagulation abnormalities and thus improve time to clinical improvement as defined as hospital discharge recorded using the World Health Organization (“WHO”) Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement. We also believe the three key mechanisms of action may also be effective in treating COVID in the outpatient setting or as a prophylaxis.
Background
ANA001 is a proprietary oral niclosamide formulation which is in development as a treatment for patients with moderate COVID-19. Niclosamide is an oral antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent with a long history of safety in humans. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of ANA001 is niclosamide (Figure 1), a chlorinated salicylanilide with anthelmintic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator activity. Niclosamide was discovered in 1958 and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in 1982 under New Drug Application (NDA) 018669 (Bayer Pharmaceuticals) for the treatment of tapeworm infections, although it has since been voluntarily discontinued from marketing in the U.S., and all patents or applications that were originally filed by Bayer AG to cover niclosamide or its use in treating tapeworm have been expired or abandoned. Niclosamide is approved in many other countries for the treatment of tapeworm infections and has been used to safely treat millions of patients globally. Niclosamide is also on the WHO’s List of Essential Medicines (World Health Organization, 2019) In the past several years, mounting evidence has accumulated that niclosamide is a multifunctional drug that is able to regulate multiple signaling pathways and biological processes, suggesting it may be developed as a novel treatment for more than just helminthic infection. Niclosamide is being studied for a variety of clinical indications beyond its use as an anthelmintic, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, metabolic syndrome and COVID-19.

Necessity to Develop a COVID-19 Therapeutic 
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single‐stranded RNA viruses that infect a wide variety of animals and primarily cause respiratory tract infections in humans. Recent outbreaks of novel CoVs, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have caused significant international concern and mortality. Surpassing both of these in severity and loss of life, the current 

7




outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 represents a severe public health emergency. COVID-19, the disease caused by a SARS-CoV-2, continues to spread worldwide. As of March 7, 2022, more than 445 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, with more than 5.9 million deaths from the disease. In the United States alone, the total number of COVID-19 cases as of March 6, 2022 is more than 79 million and the total number of deaths is more than 955,000. As of March 6, 2022, more than 555 million doses of vaccine have been administered in the United States. In addition to this tremendous toll, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that patients who have recovered from COVID-19 often exhibit long-term negative impacts such as fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, joint pain and chest pain. These symptoms sometimes require extended hospitalizations, resulting in health care costs in excess of $10,000/day. Therefore, it is necessary to develop countermeasures, such as therapeutics, that can improve the outcomes for patients who become infected with COVID-19.
​
The approval of multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has helped to slow the spread of the disease and lessen the number of deaths and hospitalizations. However, the protective efficacy of these vaccines are vulnerable to antigenic changes and can be greatly affected by viral changes in the spike protein. The spread of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant and the ability of the virus to evade antibody neutralization in individuals previously vaccinated or infected as well as those receiving several of the monoclonal antibodies underscores this vulnerability. While it is expected the SARS-CoV-2 virus will become endemic, we believe that additional therapeutic and preventative options will be needed for years to come.
​
As of March 2022, multiple treatment options have been approved or given emergency use authorization by the FDA. For hospitalized patients treatments include remdesivir (VEKLURY®), dexamethasone, baricitinib (OLUMIANT®), and tocilizumab (ACTEMRA®). Of these, only remdesivir (VEKLURY®) is considered to be an antiviral. For outpatients at high-risk for progression to severe COVID-19, antiviral treatment options include remdesivir (VEKLURY®), nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (PAXLOVID™) and molnupiravir. In addition, several monoclonal antibody preparations have been approved for use for the outpatient treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19; sotrovimab, bebtelovimab, casirivimab/imdevimab (REGEN-COV®), and bamlanivimab/etesevimab. However, as of the date of this Annual Report, only sotrovimab and bebtelovimab are currently authorized for use within the United States. This is because the widely circulating Omicron strain (B.1.1.529) is resistant to casirivimab/imdevimab (REGEN-COV®), and bamlanivimab/etesevimab. With regard to pre-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19, the monoclonal antibody combination of tixagevimab/cilgavimab (EVUSHELD™) is approved for use in certain individuals who are immunocompromised or have contraindications to an approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
​
The critical need for effective treatments and the volume of urgent activity to find them underscore the tremendous potential value of an effective therapeutic. This value predominantly comes from two sources: health-related benefits and economy-related impacts. Health-related benefits include increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) that result from reducing mortality, symptom severity and duration. Potential benefits also include savings in healthcare expenditures that result from shorter hospital stays and less intensive use of healthcare resources generally.
It is important to note that each of these treatments, with the exception of dexamethasone, are delivered intravenously. This method of delivery complicates and prevents patients from taking the drug themselves in an outpatient environment.
 ​
A white paper from the University of Southern California Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics reported (Mulligan et al., 2020): 
 ​

● | a hypothetical treatment administered outside the hospital that reduces hospitalization risk by 50% would be expected to result in 285,000 fewer hospitalizations, up to 71,000 fewer deaths, and up to $88 billion in value by the end of 2021; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a hospital-based treatment that reduces mortality and length of stay by 30% would be expected to save 51,000 to 85,000 lives, and generates up to $106 billion in value by the end of 2021.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
ANA001 has the potential to benefit patients in the outpatient setting and may also be effective as a prophylaxis treatment. Both reduction in duration of symptoms and the potential to reduce transmission would be a benefit to patients and significantly reducing healthcare expenditures.

Development Rationale
​
Niclosamide has broad in vitro antiviral activity (Figure 2) including activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Additionally, niclosamide has in vitro anti-inflammatory properties due to its inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), two main drivers to induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, a recent in vitro study showed that niclosamide works as a potent bronchodilator that relaxed histamine induced constriction of human bronchial rings (Miner et al., 2019).
​
​
Figure. 2: Broad antiviral activity of niclosamide (modified from Xu et al., 2020). Niclosamide has demonstrated in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus (EBOV), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), human adenovirus (HAdV), and Epstein−Barr virus (EBV).
​
Antiviral Activity of Niclosamide
​
Niclosamide demonstrates potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) with a mean IC50= 0.19 μM and is also active against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV (Wu et al., 2004, Wen et al., 2007, Gassen et al., 2019).

​
Furthermore, multiple studies indicate niclosamide maintains highly active in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Figure 3) like Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) (Lee et al., 2021; Weiss et al., 2021).

​
​
The antiviral mechanism of action for niclosamide has not been fully elucidated, however it appears niclosamide works at the cellular level to inhibit viral replication. In some viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, studies have demonstrated niclosamide acts as a protonaphore to increase endosomal pH. As a consequence multiple pH-dependent steps of the virus life cycle are impaired, including viral and host membrane fusion and uncoating, viral RNA replication (by inhibition of viral polyprotein processing), and the maturation process of the progeny virions (Jurgit et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2019; Prabhakara et al., 2021). Recently, studies with MERS-CoV (Gassen et al., 2019) and SARS-CoV-2 indicate replication is reduced by niclosamide via SKP2-inhibition, thus enhancing autophagy (Gassen et al., 2021). Furthermore, it was shown that pretreating cells for 24 h with 5 µM niclosamide followed by drug washout and viral infection reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication significantly and as potently as spermidine, a natural enhancer of autophagy (Gassen et al., 2021). This indicates, in addition to treating SARS-CoV-2, niclosamide has potential as a prophylactic COVID-19 treatment and serum concentrations may not need to continuously exceed in vitro inhibitory levels to be effective. In summary, these results highlight the potency of niclosamide to inhibit replication of coronaviruses, in particular, SARS-CoV-2.
​
Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Niclosamide
​
Cytokine release syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, a widespread inflammation in the lungs and increased blood clotting. Two transcription factors - nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) – are key drivers of cytokine release. Niclosamide was shown to inhibit them in vitro thus decreasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
​
NF-κB is a transcription factor that induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vitro experiments with U2OS cells demonstrated that niclosamide inhibited NF-kB transcription, its binding to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced phosphorylation of IκBα, translocation of p65 into the nucleus, and expression of NF-κB-regulated downstream genes. The IC50 of niclosamide to inhibit NF-kB transcription was 0.13 µM (Figure 4) (Jin et al., 2010). 
​

​
Figure. 4: Niclosamide prevents TNF-induced NF-κB activation. U2OS cells were co-transfected with NF-κB–TATA-Luc and renilla luciferase reporter plasmids. 24 h later, cells were first treated with different concentrations of niclosamide and then with 0.1 nmol/L TNFα, and luciferase intensity was measured. Shown are means of the fold change ± standard error of three independent experiments. * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01. Modified from Jin et al., 2010.
​
Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are a class of transcription factors that regulate cellular and biological processes, including immune responses and angiogenesis, by modulating the expression of specific target genes (Yu et al., 2007). Upon stimulation by cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), tyrosine residue 705 (Tyr-705) in the STAT3 SH2 domain is phosphorylated, consequently inducing STAT3 to dimerize, translocate into the nucleus, and induce its binding to specific DNA response elements of target genes (Schuringa et al., 2000). Niclosamide has been shown to inhibit activation and transcriptional function of STAT3 in vitro. HeLa cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter driven by a promoter sequence with 7 STAT3 binding sites so that luciferase becomes active upon STAT3 binding. Niclosamide prevented binding and thus the transcriptional function of STAT3 with an IC50 of 0.25 μM (Figure 5) (Ren et al., 2010).
​
​
Figure. 5: Niclosamide inhibits STAT3 activity. Luciferase reporter activity was evaluated after 24 h of treatment with different concentrations of niclosamide. Relative luciferase units were the ratio of the absolute activity of firefly luciferase to that of renilla luciferase. Results are representatives of three independent experiments. Modified from Ren et al., 2010.
​
Bronchodilator Activity of Niclosamide and Potential Pulmonary Benefit
​
Niclosamide has been shown in vitro and in animal models to act as a potent bronchodilator by inhibiting protein transmembrane member 16A (TMEM16A), a calcium-activated chloride channel. This ion channel is implicated in controlling both airway smooth muscle cell contraction and epithelial mucin secretion. Through inhibition of TMEM16A (IC50= 0.13 μM), niclosamide exerts its activity as a bronchodilator in vitro and in a mouse model (Cabrita et al., 2019; Centio et al., 2020; Centio et al., 2021; Miner et al., 2019). 
​
In addition to inhibiting TMEM16A, niclosamide has been shown to inhibit TMEM16F as well (Cabrita et al., 2019; Centio et al., 2020; Centio et al., 2021; Braga et al., 2021). Inhibition of TMEM16F is associated with several potential benefits in patients with COVID-19. Most notably, niclosamide blocks SARS-CoV-2 induced syncytia formation via TMEM16F (Braga et al., 2021). Also by inhibiting TMEM16A and TMEM16F, pulmonary mucous secretion is decreased which has been demonstrated in a mouse model (Cabrita et al., 2019; Centio et al., 2021). Furthermore, niclosamide prevents spike-induced platelet procoagulant activity and thrombin formation, by inhibiting TMEM16F activity in platelets (Cappelletto et al., 2022). Overall, the inhibitory effects of niclosamide on TMEM16A and TMEM16F may further help to explain the antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of the drug and its benefit for severe pulmonary infections like COVID-19 (Braga et al., 2021).

Safety Pharmacology Studies
​
Studies to support the initial FDA marketing approval of niclosamide in 1982 were conducted prior to establishment of the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines, therefore the current standard battery of safety pharmacology studies pertaining to the central nervous, 

12




cardiovascular and respiratory systems that are recommended in the ICH S7A guideline were not conducted. However, there is a substantial amount of data from human and animal exposures to support the expected safety of the proposed clinical development program. Relevant data provided in the available literature related to safety pharmacology in the nervous system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system and gastrointestinal system are summarized in Table 3 below.

​
Completed and Ongoing Clinical Studies
​
Between 1971 and 1978, niclosamide was administered to 6,365 patients under a U.S. IND. Doses were up to and including 2,000 mg/day for 7 days. There were 2,385 evaluable patients, of which 13.3% reported side effects, all of which were mild or moderate, with none requiring treatment discontinuation. These included nausea/emesis in 4.1%, abdominal discomfort/loss of appetite in 3.4%, diarrhea in 1.6%, drowsiness/dizziness/headache in 1.4%, and skin rash/pruritis in 0.3% of patients (NDA 018669 Review Documentation).

​
In addition, according to a safety review of niclosamide, pyrantel, triclabendazole and oxamniquine report of the WHO, there were 84 reported adverse drug reactions related to niclosamide between 1975 and 2004 in the WHO database. They include 173 reports from 16 countries and the most common reactions are related to skin and appendages (41 reports), GI tract (37 reports), cardiovascular system (28 reports) and anaphylactic reactions (9 reports) (Ofori-Adjei et al., 2008).

Bioavailability of Niclosamide in Human Studies
​
As ANA001 is orally administered, it can be taken by hospitalized, ambulatory and non-hospitalized individuals and it can be administered in both ambulatory and acute care environments. Although niclosamide has low bioavailability, data from available literature clearly demonstrate blood levels of niclosamide after oral administration exceed the necessary IC50 for SARS-CoV-2:

▪ | Oral administration of a single dose of 2,000 mg of niclosamide reached maximal systemic serum concentrations (Cmax) in humans of 0.76-18.3 μM (Andrews et al., 1982).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | A study in prostate cancer patients showed that 0.46-0.56 µM become available after a single oral dose of 1,000 mg (Schweizer et al., 2018).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | In a recent study, colorectal cancer patients received 2,000 mg of niclosamide orally once a day until disease progression or toxicity (up to four months). Plasma levels mainly peaked 240 minutes after the first niclosamide administration with a median Cmax of 2.03 µM (Burock et al., 2018).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The lower bounds of the reported Cmax values fall well-above the mean IC50= 0.19 µM noted from multiple in vitro assays (Jeon et al., 2020; Gassen et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2021; Braga et al., 2021; Mostafa et al., 2020) needed for SARS-CoV-2 and an anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits NF-kB and STAT3 at 0.13 µM (Jin et al., 2010) and 0.25 µM (Ren et al., 2010), respectively. It is therefore anticipated that the dose regimen foreseen for the ANA001 clinical development program will provide sufficient systemic and intracellular drug levels for effective antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity.
​
In summary, the following characteristics support the use of niclosamide as an oral treatment for COVID-19:
​

▪ | Niclosamide significantly inhibits in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2 with a mean IC50 of 0.19 µM from published clinical studies (Jeon et al., 2020; Gassen et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2021; Braga et al., 2021; Mostafa et al., 2020).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Pretreatment of mammalian cells for 24 h with 5 µM niclosamide followed by drug washout and viral infection reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication significantly (Gassen et al., 2020) pointing indicating niclosamide could be used for pre/post-exposure prophylaxis.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Niclosamide has anti-inflammatory properties that are expected to be relevant in COVID-19 patients. Niclosamide inhibits NF-kB and STAT3 with an IC50 of 0.13 µM (Jin et al., 2010) and 0.25 μM, respectively (Ren et al., 2010).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | In vitro and animal studies indicate niclosamide has potent activity on TMEM16A and TMEM16F. Niclosamide inhibition of these transmembrane chloride channels prevents SARS-CoV-2 induced syncytia formation, spike-induced platelet procoagulant activity and decreased mucus secretion (Cabrita et al., 2019; Centio et al., 2020; Centio et al., 2021; Miner et al., 2019; Braga et al., 2021; Cappelletto et al., 2022).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | In humans, a single oral dose of 1,000 mg reached maximal systemic serum concentrations of 0.46-0.56 µM (Schweizer et al., 2018). A single oral dose of 2,000 mg reached maximal systemic serum concentrations of 0.76-18.3 μM (Andrews et al., 1982) and 2.03 µM (Burock et al., 2018), respectively. These concentrations exceed the necessary in vitro concentrations suggesting a sufficient amount of drug becomes bioavailable through the course of 2,000 mg daily to provide effective antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Extensive preclinical studies indicate niclosamide does not cause significant toxicity, nor carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or embryotoxicity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Niclosamide is an FDA approved drug that has been used to treat tapeworms in humans (adults, children and pregnant women) with a well-understood safety profile upon oral administration.

ANA001 Phase 2/3 Clinical Development
ANA001 is currently being tested in a U.S. Phase 2/3 study titled “A Phase 2/3 Randomized and Placebo-Controlled Study of ANA001 in Moderate COVID-19 Patients” (NCT04603924). Niclosamide has demonstrated both antiviral and immunomodulatory activity with possible downstream effects on coagulation abnormalities observed in COVID-19. These effects support the development of ANA001, an oral formulation of niclosamide, for the treatment of COVID-19. It is therefore anticipated that ANA001 will reduce viral load and inflammation associated with cytokine dysregulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and coagulation abnormalities and thus improve time to clinical improvement as defined as hospital discharge recorded using the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement.

In addition to the aforementioned Phase 2/3 study in hospitalized patients, NeuroBo is exploring the feasibility of initiating studies with ANA001 for the outpatient treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 as well as for post-exposure prophylaxis in adults and children.
ANA001 Development Plan through NDA
An NDA is the classical vehicle through which the FDA approves a new pharmaceutical for sale and marketing in the US. However, for many COVID-19 drugs and biological products (i.e., nirmaltrelvir/ritonavir (PAXLOVID™), molnupiravir, monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma), the FDA has granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to fast-track treatments during this pandemic, sometimes with only limited safety and efficacy data available. NeuroBo expects data readout of the Phase 2 trial in the third quarter of 2022. Once the Phase 2 trial has been completed, NeuroBo will request a meeting with the FDA to discuss whether data justify an EUA or if data readout from the Phase 3 trial and other additional studies will be necessary for approval of ANA001 as a COVID-19 therapeutic. In case an EUA will not be issued, NeuroBo will pursue an NDA via a 505(b)(2).
NB-01 
NB-01 addresses a range of mechanisms that contribute to neuropathic pain and nerve degeneration in diabetic and other peripheral neuropathies. These include a decrease in key inflammatory markers, restoration of nerve growth factor (NGF) to normal levels, and reduction of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Inflammation is a central factor in pain generation and other peripheral neurodegenerative diseases. NB-01 reduces levels of TNF-a and IL-6, both of which are markers of inflammation. NB-01 also reduces AGEs, which are implicated in diabetes-related complications. AGE inhibitors have been clinically tested as potential treatments for these complications. NB-01 also restores the 

19




neurotrophin NGF, which is involved in nerve growth, maintenance and repair. NB-01 has been shown in animal models to alleviate symptoms of PDN. 
Background 
Based on third-party research, the U.S. population with diabetes is estimated at 30.3 million people. At least half of these individuals will develop diabetic neuropathy, and up to 25% of those individuals will develop neuropathic pain. According to the industry intelligence firm GlobalData plc, as of 2018, the global PDN market was responsible for approximately $3.6 billion in annual sales, approximately $2.6 billion of which is concentrated in the U.S. The same source projects that the global PDN market will increase to approximately $7.1 billion in annual sales by 2026 with approximately $4.8 billion of such sales concentrated in the U.S. Products to address PDN make up about 60% of the market, and products to address indications such as chemotherapy-induced and post-traumatic neuropathic pain are estimated to constitute an additional 20% of the market. The market is characterized by a significant unmet need, with more than 50% of patients not adequately responding to first-line therapy and patients experiencing significant side effects with existing approved therapies.
In the U.S., there are currently only three FDA-approved treatments for PDN: pregabalin (LYRICA®); duloxetine (CYMBALTA®) and tapentadol (NUCYNTA ER®). Despite an established treatment protocol for PDN based on these approved therapeutics, the current treatment paradigm for patients suffers from numerous shortcomings as a result of their negative side effects associated with the available FDA-approved drug products. The first line of therapy typically consists of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) such as gabapentin and pregabalin, which are insufficient on their own in that they have been shown to exhibit only moderate efficacy accompanied by moderate to severe side effects such as somnolence and dizziness in some patients, and, even after drug treatment, 50% to 70% of patients still experience pain. If pain persists beyond treatment with AEDs, as it often does, the second line of therapy typically consists of prescriptions for anti-depressants (SNRIs and TCAs), which have been shown to reduce pain only by an additional 20% when added to AED treatment. Treatment with anti-depressants is also associated with significant drug-to-drug interactions. If pain persists beyond treatment with AEDs and anti-depressants, the third line of therapy typically consists of opiates, which are only appropriate as a short-term option and have been shown to exhibit potentially harmful addictive and habit-forming side effects. A significant number of mortalities from drug overdose have been caused by opiates. Beyond the potential side effects, the existing approved therapies for PDN are burdened by additional safety and efficacy concerns. 
NB-01 Preclinical development 
Extensive and comprehensive preclinical pharmacology, safety and toxicology studies have been completed with NB-01, as detailed in the table below. Among the safety and toxicology studies completed are: (i) central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular (CV), gastrointestinal (GI), and respiratory safety in rats, mice and dogs; (ii) a single-dose 13-week and 26-week oral toxicity study in rats; (iii) a single-dose 13-week and 26-week oral toxicity study in dogs; (iv) range-finding embryo fetal development studies in rats; and (v) fertility, pre-and post-natal studies in rats.

In addition, in mechanism of action studies conducted by Dong-A ST, NB-01 induced nerve regeneration in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced and db/db diabetes mouse models with a significant increase in axon diameter and thickness of myelin sheath, returning thickness and diameter to almost the naturally occurring levels. Similar results were achieved in rat models, including the streptozotocin (STC) diabetes model. NGF has been shown to be lowered in diabetes and diabetic neuropathy animal models, and the administration of NB-01 in these models shows elevation of endogenous NGF to near-normal levels. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that NB-01 has a demonstrable impact on reduction of AGEs as well as inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha and interleukin-6) which are implicated in nerve degeneration in diabetes. 
Additional studies have been completed on the effect of NB-01 on thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in mouse models, including the STZ diabetes model and genetic (db/db) diabetes model. The data from these studies have demonstrated that NB-01 alleviates both thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia relative to the control. 
With respect to additional neuropathic indications, NB-01 has also been studied for its effects on rat models of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain and chronic constriction injury (CCI). In these studies, NB-01 demonstrated an analgesic effect on rats, measured by threshold of paw pressure tolerance, during treatment with paclitaxel and with CCI. In both cases, the paw pressure threshold was significantly elevated following dosing with NB-01. 
NB-01 Phase 2 Clinical Development 
Completed Phase 2 trial in Korea. A 15-site, 128-subject, double blind, dose ranging, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy and safety of NB-01 in the treatment of subjects with PDN has been completed in Korea. Three doses of NB-01 were evaluated versus placebo in 128 subjects (32 per dose group), administered daily for an 8-week treatment period. The treatment groups were placebo or one of NB-01 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg, administered three times daily (TID), for a total daily NB-01 dose of 300 mg, 600 mg or 900 mg, respectively. The primary endpoint of the study was reduction in the average daily Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score from baseline at 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints included percentage reduction in NRS at 8 weeks, Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scale, Clinical Global Impression of Severity, and change from baseline in the NRS based on a daily patient diary. 
Completed Phase 2 trial in the United States. A 14-site, 128-subject, double blind, dose ranging, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy and safety of NB-01 in the treatment of subjects with PDN has been completed in the United States. Three doses of NB-01 were evaluated versus placebo in 128 subjects (32 per dose group), administered daily for a 12-week treatment period. The treatment groups were placebo or one of NB-01 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg, administered three times daily (“TID”) for a total daily NB-01 dose of 300 mg, 600 mg or 900 mg, respectively. The primary endpoint of the study was reduction in the clinic visit Pain Numerical Rating Scale (“NRS”) score at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included percentage reduction in clinic visit NRS score at 12 weeks, proportion of subjects with at least 30% improvement in the clinic visit pain NRS score, proportion of responders in the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (“PGI-I”) scale, and change from baseline in the NRS based on a daily patient diary.

Results of Phase 2 U.S. Clinical Trial for NB-01 
Measured as a change from baseline in NRS score over the course of 12 weeks, NB-01 was observed to be generally well tolerated in its Phase 2 study at doses ranging from 300 mg to 900 mg against placebo, as summarized in the table below. 
Measured in terms of changes in the mean NRS score at week 12 in the Phase 2 study, patients treated with the 300 mg and 600 mg doses showed statistically significant improvement from baseline in pain scores. As summarized in the table below, patients treated with the 300 mg dose experienced an average 45% change from the baseline NRS score, and patients treated with the 600 mg dose experienced an average 47% change from the baseline NRS score. 

Mean Change in NRS Score at Week 12 Following NB-01 Dosing 
During the Phase 2 study, patients in each dose group experienced a number of adverse events, including nausea and pruritus, but not at a level higher than those of subjects who received placebo. 
Future Development of NB-01 
In light of the present business environment including the impact of the COVID-19 disease that emerged in December 2019 as a global threat, we have determined to cease development of NB-01 on the prior regulatory pathway and not advance to Phase 3 clinical trials. We are currently evaluating various alternatives with respect to the future of NB-01, including bringing the NB-01 asset to the market through a different regulatory pathway. Development of NB-01 as an orphan drug is among the alternatives we are considering, and we may conduct feasibility studies to identify a rare disease relevant to NB-01. Additionally, we are considering marketing the NB-01 product line as nutraceutical (non-pharmaceutical) product. There is no assurance that we will be able to pursue either alternative for NB-01. There is no assurance that we will be able to pursue any of these alternatives for NB-01. See “We are currently evaluating alternatives with respect to NB-01 pursuant to other pathways, including as an orphan drug or as a nutraceutical candidate” in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
NB-02 
NB-02 is in development for the symptomatic and disease modifying treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and tauopathies. In preclinical studies, we have observed the mechanisms of action of NB-02 to include inhibition of tau phosphorylation, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, inhibition of Ab toxicity and amyloid plaque formation, and anti-inflammatory effects. 
Specifically, in both in vitro and in vivo models, NB-02 has demonstrated inhibition of AChE, as is the case with three of the current drugs on the market to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. It has also demonstrated inhibition of tau 

22




phosphorylation and of amyloid plaque formation, both mechanisms believed to contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.
NeuroBo acquired NB-02 from Dong-A ST on January 18, 2018. NeuroBo has full worldwide rights to all disease indications for NB-02 from the asset acquisition and does not have further obligations to make future payments to Dong-A ST, however, if NeuroBo wishes to sell products using NB-02 in the Republic of South Korea, Dong-A ST is entitled to certain notice rights and rights to negotiate with respect to any distribution agreement for the sale of NB-02 in such territory.
Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive and chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory and cognitive deterioration beyond normal aging that becomes severe enough to interfere with daily tasks. It is the most common form of dementia. AD is characterized by the loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. Different mechanisms have been implicated in the underlying cause of the cognitive and functional impairments observed in AD. Degeneration of the cholinergic nervous system has been shown to be closely linked to the impairment of cognitive functions. Also, neurodegeneration caused by the buildup of two structural abnormalities known as beta-amyloid (βA) plaques and hyper-phosphorylated tau protein (pTau) aggregates that leads to neurofibrillary tangle formation is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of AD. However, neurodegeneration in AD appears to be a multi-factorial event, in which various genetics as well as environmental risk factors may play a role sequentially and/or in parallel.

Despite the need, there is no cure for AD. Currently available treatments (aducanumab [ADUHELM®], memantine [NAMENDA®], donepezil [ARICEPT®], rivastigmine [EXELON®], and galantamine [RAZADYNE®]) can only temporarily provide symptomatic relief without the ability to control disease progression. As the life expectancy increases, the prevalence of aging-associated diseases such as AD has also dramatically increased and has become a major public health concern. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of AD drugs that are capable of more than just relieving the symptoms. The current goal in AD therapeutics research is to search for drugs/interventions that can directly address the underlying disease processes of AD, also known as disease-modifying therapy (DMT), to delay or even prevent disease progression.
Based on the preclinical studies, NB-02 has both symptomatic relief benefits and disease modifying mechanism of action. Specifically, in in vivo studies, NB-02 was shown to up-regulate nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (“BNDF”) and cellular antioxidant defense system, which is indicative of neuroprotection and neuronal survival. Decrease in the accumulation of Aβ protein level and tau protein hyper-phosphorylation was also observed, which suggests NB-02 has disease modification efficacy by clearance of the toxic proteins that represent the neuropathological indices of AD. Furthermore, NB-02 was shown to reverse cognition impairment by suppressing AChE activity. The findings from these nonclinical studies collectively suggested that NB-02 could be a treatment candidate for AD via multiple mechanisms of action including cognition enhancement and disease modification.
Development Plan
NB-02 has shown considerable promise as a neuroprotective agent in preclinical studies, demonstrating a multimodal mechanism of action including inhibition of tau phosphorylation, AChE inhibition, inhibition of Ab toxicity and amyloid plaque formation, and anti-inflammatory effects. We are currently assessing strategic alternatives for NB-02, including out licensing or making it available for nutraceutical applications.
Gemcabene
Gemcabene is a novel, once-daily, oral therapy designed to target known lipid metabolic pathways to lower levels of LDL-C, hsCRP and triglycerides. Gemcabene shares many of the attributes of statin therapy, including broad therapeutic applications, convenient route of administration and cost-effective manufacturing process, but does not appear to increase the reporting of myalgia when added to statin therapy. Gemcabene has also shown additive LDL-C lowering in combination with stable low, moderate or high-intensity statin therapy. As described below, we licensed global rights to Gemcabene from Pfizer in April 2011. Under the terms of the amended and restated license agreement with Pfizer, Pfizer may terminate the license if we have not made a commercial sale by April 2024.

Gemcabene was being evaluated in a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess its efficacy safety and tolerability in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. In January 2016, the Gemcabene Phase 2 clinical study was placed on partial clinical hold as the FDA requested 2-year rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies to be completed and submitted. The study currently remains on partial clinical hold for the treatment of dyslipidemia. NeuroBo is currently assessing the path forward for Gemcabene for the indication for additional indications including COVID-19 and does not intend to direct additional resources towards Gemcabene as a cardiovascular therapy..
Background
Gemcabene's mechanism of action is multifaceted. In the liver, Gemcabene acts in two major ways to reduce levels of circulating LDL-C and triglycerides: (i) inhibition of the two metabolic pathways that synthesize precursors (i.e., cholesterol and fatty acids) of VLDL-C, LDL-C and triglycerides and (ii) stimulation of a liver mechanism known as the remnant receptor pathway that removes particles that contain cholesterol and triglycerides from the blood. Gemcabene's stimulation of this remnant receptor pathway involves enhanced removal of an LDL-C precursor known as very low-density lipoprotein remnants. With regard to Gemcabene's anti-inflammatory properties, in human clinical trials and animal studies, to date, Gemcabene has been shown to significantly reduce plasma levels of CRP. Furthermore, in preclinical studies of dyslipidemia as well as NASH, Gemcabene inhibited production of a number of known pro-inflammatory molecules (e.g., CRP, CCR2, CCR5, IL-6, TNF-alpha, MCP-1 and MIP1-beta) as well as pro-fibrotic factors (e.g., TIMP-1, MMP-2). Overall, Gemcabene's multifaceted mechanism of action provides the potential for safely addressing multiple major risk factors in a broad array of cardiometabolic patients who have an elevated risk of cardiovascular or liver disease, even when taking conventional therapies. 
Clinical Experience with Gemcabene 
Gemcabene has been assessed in 25 Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. Across these trials, over 1,500 adult subjects have participated, including healthy volunteers and patients with various underlying conditions. Of these subjects, over 1,100 have been exposed to at least one dose of Gemcabene. 
Across the Gemphire-sponsored clinical trials, Gemcabene was observed to be well tolerated at single doses up to 1,500 mg and multiple doses up to 900 mg/day. Safety of the subjects in these trials was evaluated by adverse event (“AE”) monitoring, clinical laboratory assessments, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, and vital sign assessments. Across all trials, 10 Gemcabene treated healthy volunteers or patients reported a treatment-emergent severe adverse event (“SAE”), none of which were considered by the clinician to be related to Gemcabene. No deaths occurred in any of the trials. AEs reported were generally mild to moderate in intensity with the most common events being headache, weakness, nausea, dizziness, upset stomach, infection and abnormal bowel movements. Gemcabene, when compared with placebo, was not associated with an increased incidence of myalgia or liver enzyme elevations, whether as monotherapy or in combination with statin therapy. Elevated levels of liver enzymes, specifically alanine transaminase (“ALT”) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (“AST”), were observed in three patients (0.27% of Gemcabene treated subjects). These three patients had ALT or AST levels more than three times the upper limit of normal (“ULN”) returning to near baseline after cessation of treatment. Small mean increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (“BUN”) have been observed in some trials. The increase in creatinine values was reversible returning to baseline within approximately four weeks of cessation of Gemcabene. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in physical examinations or vital signs, including blood pressure. 
In addition, Gemcabene demonstrated promising clinical pharmacology attributes across 15 completed Company-sponsored Phase 1 trials in healthy subjects, such as once-daily dosing, no meaningful drug-drug interactions with high-intensity statins and no observed food effect. Gemcabene can be taken with or without food. Gemcabene was observed to: (i) be rapidly absorbed following oral administration with time of maximum concentration within two hours and (ii) reach maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve over 24 hours (AUC0-24) that were dose proportional following both single-and multiple-dose administration. Steady state concentrations were achieved within six days of repeated dose administration. Average half-life ranged from 32 to 41 hours. Gemcabene's primary route of elimination was renal. No significant drug-drug interactions (“DDIs”) were observed with digoxin, a cardiovascular drug for the treatment of atrial fibrillation or statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin and rosuvastatin) used as background therapy in patients with HoFH, HeFH and many SHTG patients. 

24




Gemcabene has been evaluated in ten Company-sponsored Phase 2 trials across a diverse patient population. These trials explored safety, tolerability and efficacy using multiple doses of Gemcabene as monotherapy and in combination with low-, moderate- and high-intensity statins. In Company-sponsored Phase 2 trials, patients treated with Gemcabene were observed to have significantly lowered LDL-C, hsCRP and triglycerides. 
Development Plan 
We are assessing Gemcabene as a treatment for additional indications including COVID-19 in combination with ANA001. NeuroBo does not intend to direct additional resources towards Gemcabene as a cardiovascular therapy. 
Development History
The historical development of Gemcabene is as follows: in August 2018, Gemphire announced that it had completed and submitted to the FDA the results from its two year rodent carcinogenicity studies. These studies were submitted as part of a request for the FDA to remove the partial clinical hold that prevents human studies of Gemcabene that are greater than six months in duration. In response to its submission, the FDA did not lift the hold, requested that Gemphire provide additional data, including two preclinical studies, namely, a subchronic (13 week) study of Gemcabene in PPARa knock-out mice and a study of Gemcabene in in vitro PPAR transactivation assays using monkey and canine PPAR isoforms and informed Gemphire that an End-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting to reach agreement on the design of Phase 3 registration and long-term safety exposure trials for its target indications in dyslipidemia would not take place until such time, if ever, as the clinical hold is lifted.
In late 2017 and early 2018, Gemphire announced the initiation of two non-Company investigator-initiated proof-of-concept Phase 2 trials in Pediatric Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and in Familial Partial Lipodystrophy Disease (FPLD). 
In August 2018, the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) halted the Pediatric NAFLD trial early due to “unanticipated problems” in the first three patients. Specifically, ALT was increased in 2 of these 3 subjects beyond baseline levels. In addition, all 3 subjects had an increase in liver fat fraction as measured by MRI PDFF. All 6 subjects treated in this study gained weight and had increased TGs during study treatment. These observations are in contrast to the totality of the evidence from other Gemcabene trials. In addition, there was evidence of non-compliance to the dosing regimen and patient non-adherence to dietary and lifestyle guidelines, as well as inconsistencies in biomarkers. The six pediatric patients that were enrolled in the study were followed for a 12 month safety monitoring period post final dose. During this follow-on period there were no drug related adverse events reported. There was one serious non-related adverse event of hospitalization of subacute spinal cord infarction/embolism. No deaths or other SAEs were reported. 
In June 2019, Gemphire reported topline data from the FPLD trial. Overall Gemcabene treatment resulted in a median change in serum triglycerides (TGs) of –19.6% for the five patients at twelve weeks (the primary endpoint) with a range of TG responses from +40.4% to –52.9% and three patients showing decreases. Gemcabene was generally well tolerated and safe. Nonsignificant fluctuations in ALT, AST, serum creatinine and eGFR were observed. Four of 5 subjects completed the study; one subject withdrew due to an AE of right quadrant pain considered related to Gemcabene. There was one SAE of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo considered unrelated to treatment.
On July 24, 2019, Gemphire announced that it had entered into the Beijing SL License Agreement pursuant to which Gemphire has granted to Beijing SL an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize products containing Gemcabene for the treatment of any human disease in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.
With respect to the partial clinical hold that prevents human studies of Gemcabene that are greater than six months in duration, Gemphire has completed the in vitro PPAR transactivation studies and the subchronic study of Gemcabene in PPARa knock-out mice. In May 2020, we received written communication from the FDA that the clinical development program for Gemcabene remains on a partial clinical hold.

The term of the agreement continues on a country-by country and product-by-product basis until the later of the 12th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country or expiration or termination of the last valid claim within the patent rights covering the product. The royalty rate is then reduced by 30% in any country that prohibits 

26




the payment of royalties on a patent license beyond the expiration or invalidation of the last valid claim covering the product. 
Either Dong-A ST or we may terminate the agreement if the other party is in material breach of the agreement and has not cured or started to cure the breach within 60 days of notice of such breach, or is subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency event. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days’ written notice. 
We may assign our rights under the agreement in connection with a merger, consolidation, or sale of substantially all of its assets, with prior written notice to Dong-A ST, and if the successor entity agrees in writing to be bound by the agreement.
Pfizer License Agreement
In August 2018, an Amended and Restated License Agreement with Pfizer (the “Pfizer Agreement”) for the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of Gemcabene went into effect. This agreement amended and restated in full the prior license agreement with Pfizer dated April 16, 2011.
The Pfizer Agreement included milestone payments to Pfizer totaling up to $37 million upon the achievement of certain milestones, including the first NDA (or its foreign equivalent) in any country, regulatory approval in each of the United States, Europe and Japan, the first anniversary of the first regulatory approval in any country, and upon achieving certain aggregate sales levels of Gemcabene. Future milestone payments under the Pfizer Agreement, if any, would not be expected to begin for at least several years and extend over a number of subsequent years. 
Pfizer will also receive tiered royalties on a country-by-country basis based upon the annual amount of net sales as specified in the Pfizer Agreement until the later of: (i) five years after the first commercial sale in such country; (ii) the expiration of all regulatory or data exclusivity for Gemcabene in such country; and (iii) the expiration or abandonment of the last valid claim of the licensed patents, including any patent term extensions or supplemental protection certificates in such country. The royalty rates range from the high single digits to the mid-teens depending on the level of net sales. The royalty rates are subject to reduction during certain periods when therapeutically-equivalent generic products represent a certain market share of prescription volume in the country. Under the Pfizer Agreement, commercially reasonable efforts must be used to develop and commercialize Gemcabene. 
The Pfizer Agreement will expire upon expiration of the last royalty term. On expiration (but not earlier termination), we will have a perpetual, exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free license under the licensed patent rights and related data to make, use, develop, commercialize, import and otherwise exploit the clinical product candidate Gemcabene. Either party may terminate the Pfizer Agreement for the other party's material breach following a cure period or immediately upon certain insolvency events relating to the other party. Pfizer may immediately terminate the Pfizer Agreement in the event that (i) we or any of our affiliates or sublicenses contests or challenges, or supports or assists any third party to contest or challenge, Pfizer's ownership of or rights in, or the validity, enforceability or scope of any of the patents licensed under the Pfizer Agreement or (ii) we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees fails to achieve the first commercial sale in at least one country by April 16, 2024.
License Agreement with Beijing SL
As of July 23, 2019, Beijing SL has an exclusive royalty-bearing license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize pharmaceutical products comprising, as an active ingredient, Gemcabene in the territory comprised of mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. We retain all rights to Gemcabene outside of the territory. The parties have agreed to collaborate with respect to development and commercialization activities under the Beijing SL License Agreement through a joint steering committee composed of an equal number of representatives of Beijing SL and us. 
Beijing SL will be responsible, at its expense, for developing and commercializing products containing Gemcabene in the territory, with certain assistance from us. To the extent mutually agreed to in writing, the parties will collaborate on the Phase 3 clinical trial for HoFH or other clinical trials, with us as the sponsor, and designed to enroll patients both inside and outside the territory, but Beijing SL will be responsible, at its expense, for the conduct of any such study to the extent solely in the territory. Beijing SL will be responsible for development activities, including non-clinical and 

27




clinical studies directed at obtaining regulatory approval of the licensed product in the territory. Beijing SL has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed products for each indication that receives regulatory approval in the territory and shall prepare and present a commercialization plan that shall be subject to approval by the joint steering committee. 
Pursuant to the Beijing SL License Agreement, Beijing SL made an upfront gross payment of $2.5 million. Additionally, with respect to each licensed product, Beijing SL will pay (i) payments for specified developmental and regulatory milestones (including submission of a NDA to China's National Medical Product Administration, dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial in mainland China and regulatory approval for the first and each additional indication of a Licensed Product in the Territory) totaling up to $6 million in the aggregate and (ii) payments for specified global net sales milestones of up to $20 million in the aggregate multiplied by the ratio of the net sales of a licensed product divided by the global net sales of a licensed product, which net sales milestone payments are payable once, upon the first achievement of such milestone. 
Beijing SL will also be obligated to pay tiered royalties ranging from the mid-teens to twenty percent on the net sales of all licensed products in the territory until the latest of (a) the date on which any applicable regulatory exclusivity with respect to such Licensed Product expires in such region, (b) the expiration or abandonment of the last valid patent claim or joint patent claim covering such Licensed Product in each region and (c) the fifth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in such region. Future milestone payments under the Beijing SL License Agreement, if any, are not expected to begin for at least one year and will extend over a number of subsequent years. 
Either party may terminate the Beijing SL License Agreement (x) with written notice for the other party's material breach following a cure period or (y) if the other party becomes subject to certain insolvency proceedings. In addition, we may terminate the Beijing SL License Agreement in its entirety if Beijing SL or its affiliates or sublicensees commence a proceeding challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of any of our patents. 
The Beijing SL License Agreement contemplates that parties shall, no later than twelve months prior to the anticipated date of the first commercial sale of a licensed product, if any, negotiate in good faith and execute a commercial supply agreement, pursuant to which Beijing SL shall purchase from us, and we shall use commercially reasonable efforts to supply, Gemcabene or licensed product for clinical or commercial purposes, as applicable, until manufacturing and regulatory transfers are complete. 

















Manufacturing
ANA001 is a small molecule drug candidate that can be synthesized using readily available raw materials and based on conventional chemical processes. Contract manufacturers produce both the drug substance and drug product required for the preclinical studies and clinical trials of ANA001. All of the contract manufacturers have updated GMP certificates and all of the drug products are being manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (GMP), a quality system regulating CMC activities.
ANA001 capsules are manufactured under GMP to support all clinical trials. More specifically, drug substance and drug product manufacturing process and analytical method development have been optimized and updated based on ICH/FDA guidelines. There is solid stability data for both the drug substance and drug product. The current contract manufacturers have been producing, and could produce in the future, bulk drug substance and drug product for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials on a purchase order basis.
NB-01
NB-01 is derived from two plant species native to China, Dioscorea Rhizome and Dioscoreae Nipponicae Rhizoma. Both species have been previously used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of arthritis-related pain, muscular pain and pain related to other conditions such as Kashin-Beck disease. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a style of traditional medicine built on a foundation of more than 2,500 years of Chinese medical practice that includes various forms of herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage (tui na), exercise (qigong), and dietary therapy.

28




While the characterization of the full composition of NB-01 and underlying active compounds is underway, certain compounds have been identified for purposes of product screening and quality control. These include allantoin and dioscin, the chemical structures for which are shown in the figure below. Allantoin is a marker of the D. Rhizome extract and dioscin is a marker of the D. Nipponicae Rhizoma extract. Signature high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chemical profile assays are established for both markers. These markers are used to show the drug quality profile during the manufacturing of the drug extract from the plant species and the final drug product formulation used in the human clinical studies. 

NB-01 is manufactured in a highly monitored and controlled manner to ensure rigorous batch-to-batch consistency that yields a complex mixture of active compounds. NB-01 is considered a "botanical drug product" by the FDA, which defines this class of products to include plant materials, algae, macroscopic fungi, and combinations thereof. As a result, it has unique features that must be taken into account during the drug development process. Plant species used for the production of our compounds are cultivated on dedicated, Good Agricultural Practices (GAP)-compliant acreage in accordance with established WHO standards for starting materials of plant or herbal origin, as recommended by FDA its guidelines for botanical drug development. Production of the drug substance from the botanical raw material involves modern harvesting and extraction processes incorporating state-of-the-art molecular biology and analytical chemistry methodologies. 
The manufacturing process and analytical testing methodologies have been validated and the adherence to regulatory requirements of the processes have been audited by two firms, Amarex and FDAMap, well-experienced in the review and audit of botanical drug requirements of the FDA. The drug substance, an ethanol extract of the two plant species, combined in a specific weight ratio, is manufactured in KGC Yebon, in South Korea in a GMP-compliant process, and has been audited by Amarex and FDAMap. The drug substance has completed process validation and analysis method validation, and demonstrated 36-month stability. The drug product is manufactured by Dong-A ST in South Korea in a GMP-compliant process, and is audited by Amarex and FDAMap. The final drug product has completed process validation and analysis method validation, and demonstrated 36-month stability.
NB-02
NB-02 is derived from two plant materials, Morus alba Linne and the peel of Poria cocos Wolf. NB-02 is manufactured in a highly monitored and controlled manner to ensure rigorous batch-to-batch consistency that yields a complex mixture of active compounds. NB-02 is considered a "botanical drug product" by the FDA, which defines this class of products to include plant materials, algae, macroscopic fungi, and combinations thereof. As a result, NB-02 has unique features that must be taken into account during the drug development process. Plant species used for the production of our compounds are cultivated on dedicated, GAP-compliant acreage in accordance with established WHO standards for starting materials of plant or herbal origin, as recommended by FDA its guidelines for botanical drug development. Production of the drug substance from the botanical raw material involves modern harvesting and extraction processes incorporating state-of-the-art molecular biology and analytical chemistry methodologies. 
Gemcabene
Gemcabene is a small molecule drug candidate that can be synthesized as a single polymorph crystalline monocalcium salt, using readily available raw materials and based on conventional chemical processes. Contract manufacturers produce both the drug substance and drug product required for the preclinical studies and clinical trials of Gemcabene. All of the contract manufacturers have updated GMP certificates and all of the drug products are being manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (GMP), a quality system regulating CMC activities. 
Gemcabene Immediate Release (IR) tablets are manufactured under GMP to support all clinical trials. More specifically, drug substance and drug product manufacturing process and analytical method development have been optimized and 

29




updated based on ICH/FDA guidelines. In addition, Gemcabene is successfully manufactured in multiple strengths of tablets under GMP: 150mg, 300mg, and 600mg. There is solid stability data for both the drug substance and drug product. The current contract manufacturers have been producing, and could produce in the future, bulk drug substance and drug product for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials on a purchase order basis. 
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
Some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Other firms may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for our programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors with us, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize therapeutics that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain marketing approvals for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in some cases insurers or other third-party payors, including government programs, seek to encourage the use of generic products. This may have the effect of making branded products less attractive, from a cost perspective, to buyers. 
ANA001—COVID-19
We expect that, if approved, ANA001 will compete with a number of drugs that are being studied for the treatment of symptoms of COVID-19. Currently, multiple treatment options have been approved or given emergency use authorization by the FDA. For hospitalized patients treatments include remdesivir (VEKLURY®), dexamethasone, baricitinib (Olumiant®), and tocilizumab (ACTEMRA®). Of these, only remdesivir (VEKLURY®) is considered to be an antiviral. For outpatients at high-risk for progression to severe COVID-19, antiviral treatment options include remdesivir (VEKLURY®), nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (PAXLOVID™) and molnupiravir. In addition, several monoclonal antibody preparations have been approved for use for the outpatient treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19; sotrovimab, bebtelovimab, casirivimab/imdevimab (REGEN-COV®), and bamlanivimab/etesevimab. However, at the time of preparation of this document only sotrovimab and bebtelovimab are currently authorized for use within the United States. This is because the widely circulating Omicron strain (B.1.1.529) is resistant to casirivimab/imdevimab (REGEN-COV®), and bamlanivimab/etesevimab. With regard to pre-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19, the monoclonal antibody combination of tixagevimab/cilgavimab (Evusheld™) is approved for use in certain individuals who are immunocompromised or have contraindications to an approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. 
​
While vaccines and the aforementioned approved products do provide a clear benefit, there are still many unmet needs regarding therapeutics for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. There are no drugs currently approved for the post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2. Changing SARS-CoV-2 variants evade the protective effects of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. With all direct acting antivirals there is the concern for the emergence of resistance in addition to product specific concerns. Remdesivir (VEKLURY®) must be given in the healthcare setting as it only comes in an intravenous formulation. Molnupiravir is not recommended in children ≤18 years as well as pregnant women and those trying to become pregnant. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (PAXLOVID™) has many contraindications secondary to a multitude of drug-drug interactions. There is still a clear clinical need for an oral antiviral that can be given to a wider group of individuals including children.
​

30




Many companies are still working to develop new treatments for COVID-19. These include Novartis, Adagio Therapeutics, Shionogi, Pardes Biosciences, Atea Pharmaceuticals, and Enanta Pharmaceuticals. We are also aware of several companies currently developing and commercializing niclosamide for the treatment of COVID-19 symptoms, these include Daewoong Pharmaceuticals, Union Therapeutics, TFF Pharmaceuticals, and First Wave Biopharma. This is a constantly changing environment, the aforementioned companies are the ones we believe could be the most competitive to ANA001, however this is not a comprehensive list of all companies developing therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19.
NB-01—Painful Diabetic Neuropathy 
We expect that, if approved, NB-01 will compete with currently approved drug therapies for painful diabetic neuropathy, including pregabalin (LYRICA®), duloxetine (CYMBALTA®), and tapentadol HCl (NUCYNTA®). We are also aware of a number of therapies that are approved to treat other types of neuropathic pain, and that various therapies are used off-label to treat neuropathic pain. In addition to the marketed therapies, we are aware of several companies currently developing therapies for neuropathic pain, including Biogen Inc., Cara Therapeutics, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo Company, Eliem Therapeutics Inc, Immune Pharmaceuticals Inc., Novartis AG, and Xenoport Inc.
NB-02—Cognitive disease and Tauopathies 
We expect that, if we determine to advance the development of NB-02, NB-02 will compete with the currently approved therapies for management of cognitive disease including Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, five drugs are currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, based on AChE inhibition (donepezil [ARICEPT®], rivastigmine [EXELON®], and galantamine [RAZADYNE®]), immunotherapy to reduce amyloid beta plaques (aducanumab [ADUHELM®]) and NMDA receptor antagonism (memantine [NAMENDA®]). In addition to the marketed therapies, we are aware of several companies currently developing therapies for Alzheimer's disease, including Eisai Co., Ltd., Hoffman-LaRoche, Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novartis AG, Avanir Pharmaceuticals, and Biohaven Pharmaceuticals. 
Intellectual Property
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application or a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application to which a U.S. application claims priority. In the United States, a patent's term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a U.S. patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when approval from the FDA is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, our product candidates receive approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and/or other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or other favorable adjustment to the term of any of its patents. 
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates, preclinical compounds, and its core technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, patent applications were subject to a “first to invent” rule of law. Applications effectively filed on or after March 16, 2013, are subject to a “first to file” rule of law. 
Discoveries reported in the scientific literature often lag the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. We cannot be certain that any existing application will be subject to the “first to file” or “first to invent” rule of law, that we 

31




or our licensor were the first to make the inventions claimed in our existing patent portfolio subject to the prior laws, or that we or our licensor were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions subject to the new laws. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology we have claimed in our patents or patent applications, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings and/or invalidation proceedings in the USPTO, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. 
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain its competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with its employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed under those agreements. 
Our ability to commercialize product candidates depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates. Our policy is to seek to protect our intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business strategy. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

Government authorities at the federal, state and local level in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture (including any manufacturing changes), packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
United States — FDA Regulation
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as imposition of clinical holds, refusal by the FDA to approve pending NDAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves preclinical or other nonclinical laboratory and animal tests and the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. For commercial approval, the sponsor must submit adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show that the drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling. The sponsor must also submit substantial evidence, generally consisting of adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to establish that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling. In certain cases, the FDA may determine that a drug is effective based on one clinical study plus confirmatory evidence. Satisfaction of the FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. For botanical drug products in particular, which may be heterogeneous in nature and may carry additional uncertainty about their active constituents in comparison to synthetic small-molecule drug products, one of the critical issues during drug development is ensuring that the therapeutic effect for marketed drug product batches is consistent. The FDA has determined that therapeutic consistency can generally be supported by a "totality of the evidence" approach, which the agency has outlined in a 2016 guidance for industry entitled Botanical Drug Development. 
Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal requirements, including the FDA's good laboratory practice regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's, or USDA's, regulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act. The results of nonclinical testing are 

33




submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal studies of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not imposed a clinical hold on the IND or otherwise commented or questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors (some of which have been codified into U.S. federal regulations), and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, at each site where a trial will be conducted for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In general, in Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human volunteers or, in some cases, patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. The FDA may, however, determine that a drug is effective based on one clinical trial plus confirmatory evidence. Only a small percentage of investigational drugs complete all three phases and obtain marketing approval. In some cases, the FDA may require post-market studies, known as Phase 4 studies, to be conducted as a condition of approval to gather additional information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. Depending on the risks posed by the drugs, other post-market requirements may be imposed. 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee. 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the statute and implementing regulations, the FDA has 180 days (the initial review cycle) from the date of filing to issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter, unless the review period is adjusted by mutual agreement between the FDA and the applicant or as a result of the applicant submitting a major amendment. In practice, the performance goals established pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act have effectively extended the initial review cycle beyond 180 days. The FDA's current performance goals call for the FDA to complete review of 90% of standard (non-priority) NDAs within 10 months of receipt and within six months for priority NDAs, but two additional months are added to standard and priority NDAs for a new molecular entity, or NME, such that the 10-month and 6-month action goals for NME applications begin to run from the 60-day filing date rather than from receipt of the original NDA submission. 

34




The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter (CRL) generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing 90% of NDA resubmissions within two to six months depending on the type of information included in response to the deficiencies identified in the CRL. 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and/or elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
The FDA is authorized to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and other accelerated approvals. 
Under the Fast Track Program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate that is intended to treat a serious condition may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor's request. In addition to other benefits such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug's NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA's time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
In 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory program for products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to designated breakthrough therapies, including: holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
The FDA may also designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when 

35




compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA's goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The accelerated approval regulations are codified within Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as Subpart H under Part 314, the part of the FDA regulations covering applications for FDA approval to market a new drug, and as such the accelerated approval pathway is sometimes referred to as approval under “Subpart H.” 
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved under Subpart H is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. Unless otherwise informed by the FDA, for an accelerated approval product an applicant must submit to the FDA for consideration during the preapproval review period copies of all promotional materials, including promotional labeling as well as advertisements, intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval. After 120 days following marketing approval, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the applicant must submit promotional materials at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination of the labeling or initial publication of the advertisement. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals. The U.S. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity and trade name, if any, of the drug and its designated use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. 
Nutraceutical Regulation

The FDA regulates foods, food additives, drugs and cosmetics. Unlike pharmaceutical drugs and conventional foods, nutraceuticals are regulated as “dietary supplements” under the Dietary Supplement, Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) as a separate regulatory category of food. Before the DSHEA, dietary supplements were subject to the same regulatory requirements as were other foods. DSHEA amended the FDCA to create a new regulatory framework for the safety and labeling of dietary supplements. Under the DSHEA, a company is responsible for determining that the dietary 

36




supplements it manufactures or distributes are safe and that any representations or claims made about them are substantiated by adequate evidence to show that they are not false or misleading. Dietary supplements do not need approval from FDA before they are marketed. Except in the case of a “new dietary ingredient,” where pre-market review for safety data and other information is required by law, a firm does not have to provide FDA with the evidence it relies on to substantiate safety or effectiveness before or after marketing a product. In addition, there is a requirement for manufacturers to register pursuant to the Bioterrorism Act with the FDA before producing or selling supplements. In June 2007, FDA published regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) for those who manufacture, package, label or hold dietary supplement products. These regulations focus on practices that ensure the identity, purity, quality, strength and composition of dietary supplements.

Congress defined the term “dietary supplement” in DSHEA as “a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs or other botanicals; a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of the ingredients listed above.” A dietary supplement is a product taken by mouth that contains a “dietary ingredient” intended to supplement the diet. The “dietary ingredients” in these products may include vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues, glandulars, and metabolites and can also be extracts or concentrates. Dietary supplements are produced in the form of tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders. Dietary supplements can also be in other forms, such as a nutrition bar, but if they are in another form, information on their label must not represent the product as a conventional food or a sole item of a meal or diet. Regardless of form, DSHEA places dietary supplements in a special category under the general umbrella of “foods,” not drugs, and requires the product to be labeled as a “dietary supplement.”
​
According to the FDA, a drug is an article intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease. While nutraceuticals are not intended to cure or treat disease, both dietary supplements and drugs are intended to affect the structure or function of the body. Dietary supplements that contain structure/function claims on their labels must bear the disclaimer: "This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease." The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and truthfulness of these claims; they are not approved by FDA. Moreover, dietary supplements are supposed to enhance the diet, not be used as a conventional food or as the sole item of a meal or diet, and not supposed to be taken alone as a substitute for any food or medicine.
​
The DSHEA requires that a manufacturer or distributor notify FDA if it intends to market a dietary supplement in the U.S. that contains a “new dietary ingredient.” The manufacturer and distributor must demonstrate to FDA why the ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe for use in a dietary supplement, unless it has been recognized as a food substance and is present in the food supply. A new dietary ingredient is an ingredient marketed after October 15, 1994. There is no authoritative list of dietary ingredients that were marketed before October 15, 1994. Therefore, manufacturers and distributors are responsible for determining if a dietary ingredient is “new,” and if it is not, for documenting that the dietary supplements its sells, containing the dietary ingredient, were marketed before October 15, 1994. The DSHEA states that the manufacturer is responsible for the safety evaluation of the product. If the dietary supplement contains a new ingredient, the manufacturer must inform FDA that the new ingredient “can reasonably be expected to be safe” within 75 days of going to market. This notice must provide information that supports the manufacturer’s conclusion that the ingredient is safe. It is up to the FDA to prove that a dietary supplement is unsafe after it is marketed.

A dietary supplement is adulterated if, among other things, it or an ingredient in it presents a “significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury” when used as directed or contains a new ingredient for which there is insufficient information to provide assurance that the ingredient does not present any significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The DSHEA also has labeling requirements for dietary supplements, including requiring information on the label such as (1) name of each ingredient; (2) quantity of each ingredient; (3) total weight of all ingredients, if a blend; (4) identity of the plant part used; (5) the term “Dietary Supplement;” and (6) nutritional labelling information (calories, fat, sodium, etc.). 
​
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers for submission of data, as well as deferrals for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to 

37




be collected before the pediatric studies begin. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA's determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers. 
Special Protocol Assessment
A company may reach an agreement with the FDA under the Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, process as to the required design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim for a new drug product. According to its performance goals, the FDA seeks to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. An SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record. Under the FDCA and FDA guidance implementing the statutory requirement, an SPA is generally binding on the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy after the study begins, public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, the sponsor and the FDA agree to the change in writing, or if the study sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of these trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for up to two years if the sponsor certifies that it is seeking approval of an unapproved product or that it will file an application for approval of a new indication for an approved product within one year. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of the development programs. Failure to timely register a covered clinical study or to submit study results as provided for in the law can give rise to civil monetary penalties and also prevent the non-compliant party from receiving future grant funds from the federal government. Since the NIH's Final Rule on ClinicalTrials.gov registration and reporting requirements became effective in 2017, both NIH and FDA have signaled the government's willingness to begin enforcing those requirements against clinical trial sponsors who fail to meet those legal obligations, with FDA releasing a guidance document in August 2020 for certain procedural steps it intends to take when determining whether and how to assess civil monetary penalties against a non-compliant party. 
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured, marketed or distributed pursuant to FDA approval decisions are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to FDA review and approval before they can be implemented. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and related manufacturing facilities, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture of approved drugs are required to register their facilities with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with GMP requirements. Prescription drug distribution facilities are also subject to state licensure, including inspections, by the relevant local regulatory authority. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved drug are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being 

38




implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from GMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and others involved in the drug manufacturing process. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance and ensure ongoing compliance with other statutory requirements the FDCA, such as the requirements for making manufacturing changes to an approved NDA.
Thus, even after new drug approval is granted, Regulatory authorities may withdraw that approval or request product recalls if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences of regulatory non-compliance include, among other things:

​ | | ​ |

As described further below, the FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant penalties.

The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
Orange Book Listing
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. As part of the marketing application process when seeking approval for a new drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA every patent of which claims cover the applicant's product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, approval information about the drug along with each of the applicant's listed patents is then published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the "Orange Book." Pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the reference license drug (“RLD”) and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be bioequivalent to the RLD. The FDA is responsible for determining that the generic drug is "bioequivalent" to the innovator drug, although under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if "the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug..." 
Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are most often considered to be therapeutically equivalent to the RLD, are commonly referred to as "generic equivalents" to the RLD, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original RLD in accordance with state law. Specifically, upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is "therapeutically equivalent" to the RLD in the Orange Book. By operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA's designation of therapeutic equivalence in the Orange Book often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or the patient.

39




The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also amended the FDCA to enact Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. A Section 505(b)(2) applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies, if it can establish that reliance on studies conducted for a previously-approved product is scientifically appropriate. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional trials or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. With respect to listed patents, patent certification requirements, and the blocking of follow-on marketing applications for the drug product previously approved under an NDA and listed in the Orange Book—known as the reference listed drug, or RLD—505(b)(2) NDA applications and ANDAs are required under the statute and FDA's implementing regulations to follow similar procedures and are subject to similar conditions. However, only in some cases is a 505(b)(2) NDA-approved drug product determined by FDA to be therapeutically equivalent to the original innovator RLD.
As part of its own marketing application process, the ANDA/505(b)(2) applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the relevant RLD in the FDA's Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify either that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the generic product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement, certifying that its proposed ANDA or 505(b)(2) labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. 
If the ANDA/505(b)(2) applicant does not challenge the innovator's listed patents, or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA/505(b)(2) application will not be approved by the FDA until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA/505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of that Paragraph IV certification to the NDA sponsor and patent holders once FDA accepts the ANDA/505(b)(2) application for filing. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification, as provided for in the statute. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA/505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA/505(b)(2) applicant. 
Non-Patent Exclusivity
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA also may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. During this five years of marketing exclusivity, the FDA cannot receive any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking approval of a drug that references a version of the NCE drug. 
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or the addition of a new indication. During this three-year period of exclusivity, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that includes the change. 
An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification 

40




requirement, and in such situations, no ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 
For a botanical drug, the FDA may determine that the active moiety is one or more of the principal components, or the complex mixture as a whole. This determination would affect the possibility of any five-year exclusivity as well as the ability of any potential generic competitor to demonstrate that it is the same drug as the original botanical drug. Because the agency has not promulgated specific regulations for botanical drug products and is approaching the development of such products, especially those that are composed of more complex mixtures, on a case-by-case basis, the 2016 Botanical Drug Development guidance for industry represents the best source for the FDA's current thinking on these drug products. 
Patent Term Extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug's testing phase—the time between IND submission and NDA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years from market approval. 
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
Prescription Drug Marketing Act
As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians, as well as prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations.
New Legislation and Regulations 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA and relevant regulatory authorities outside the United States. In addition to new legislation, regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by regulatory authorities in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
If we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and launch them commercially in the United States, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Some of the laws that may affect our future ability to operate include:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

41





● | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners and physician ownership and investment interests; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Moreover, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act.

Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of its products, if approved. 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. 
The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
In the European Union, medicinal products are subject to extensive pre- and post-marketing regulation by regulatory authorities at both the European Union and national levels. Additional rules also apply at the national level to the manufacture, import, export, storage, distribution and sale of controlled substances. In many E.U. member states the regulatory authority responsible for medicinal products is also responsible for controlled substances. Responsibility is, however, split in some member states. Generally, any company manufacturing or distributing a medicinal product containing a controlled substance in the European Union will need to hold a controlled substances license from the competent national authority and will be subject to specific record-keeping and security obligations. Separate import or export certificates are required for each shipment into or out of the member state.
Clinical Trials and Marketing Approval 
Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a 

42




country's requirements and a company has received favorable ethics committee approval, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country, even though there is already some degree of legal harmonization in the European Union member states resulting from the national implementation of underlying E.U. legislation. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements. 
To obtain regulatory approval to place a drug on the market in the European Union, we must submit a marketing authorization application. This application is similar to the NDA in the United States, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. All application procedures require an application in the common technical document, or CTD, format, which includes the submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and non-clinical and clinical trial information. Drugs can be authorized in the European Union by using (i) the centralized authorization procedure, (ii) the mutual recognition procedure, (iii) the decentralized procedure or (iv) national authorization procedures. 

The European Commission created the centralized procedure for the approval of human drugs to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union and, by extension (after national implementing decisions) in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which, together with the E.U. member states, comprise the European Economic Area, or EEA. Applicants file marketing authorization applications with the EMA, where they are reviewed by a relevant scientific committee, in most cases the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. The EMA forwards CHMP opinions to the European Commission, which uses them as the basis for deciding whether to grant a marketing authorization. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the European Union, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated "orphan drugs" (drugs used for rare human diseases) and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may, at the voluntary request of the applicant, also be used for human drugs which do not fall within the above-mentioned categories if the CHMP agrees that (a) the human drug contains a new active substance not yet approved on November 20, 2005; (b) it constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or (c) authorization under the centralized procedure is in the interests of patients at the E.U. level.
Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the EMA is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP), with adoption of the actual marketing authorization by the European Commission thereafter. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest from the point of view of therapeutic innovation, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated, the absence of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach, and anticipation of exceptional high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150 days and the opinion issued thereafter. 
For those medicinal products for which the centralized procedure is not available, the applicant must submit marketing authorization applications to the national medicines regulators through one of three procedures: (i) the mutual recognition procedure (which must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other E.U. member state, and in which the E.U. member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the other E.U. member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health), (ii) the decentralized procedure (in which applications are submitted simultaneously in two or more E.U. member states) or (iii) national authorization procedures (which results in a marketing authorization in a single E.U. member state).

43




Mutual Recognition Procedure 
The mutual recognition procedure, or MRP, for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing authorizations within the European Union. Basically, the MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products and must be used if the product has already been authorized in one or more member states.
The characteristic of the MRP is that the procedure builds on an already—existing marketing authorization in a member state of the European Union that is used as a reference in order to obtain marketing authorizations in other E.U. member states. In the MRP, a marketing authorization for a drug already exists in one or more member states of the European Union and subsequently marketing authorization applications are made in other E.U. member states by referring to the initial marketing authorization. The member state in which the marketing authorization was first granted will then act as the reference member state. The member states where the marketing authorization is subsequently applied for act as concerned member states. The concerned member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the reference member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health. 
The MRP is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by E.U. member states of their respective national marketing authorizations. Based on a marketing authorization in the reference member state, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other member states. In such case, the reference member state shall update its existing assessment report about the drug in 90 days. After the assessment is completed, copies of the report are sent to all member states, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states then have 90 days to recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement. 
If any E.U. member state refuses to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the issue will be referred to a coordination group. Within a timeframe of 60 days, member states shall, within the coordination group, make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee is then forwarded to the European Commission for the start of the decision making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human Medicinal Products.
Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union
In the European Union, NCEs qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator's data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization (MA) holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a NCE and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products approved for marketing in the United States by the FDA will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, and commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, 

44




state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, utilization management and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our operating results. If these third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell its products on a profitable basis. 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D is available through both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. 
Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval in the U.S. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers. 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), was enacted with the goal of expanding coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall health care costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. 
Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
In the United States, Medicare covers certain drug purchases by the elderly and eligible disabled people and introduced a reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, Medicare may limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Ongoing cost reduction initiatives and future laws could decrease the coverage and price that we will receive for any approved products. While Medicare beneficiaries are limited to most elderly and certain disabled individuals, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. 
​

Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our product candidates are the following:

● | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service Act's pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals (i.e., the Federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which has since been expanded to cover additional specified healthcare providers);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we will receive for any approved product. Any reduction in payments from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. 
​
There remain judicial and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to health care, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. The likelihood of success of these and other measures initiated by the former Trump administration is uncertain.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, some E.U. 

46




jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. Such differences in national pricing regimes may create price differentials between E.U. member states. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the E.U. do not follow price structures of the United States. In the E.U., the downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become intense. As a result, barriers to entry of new products are becoming increasingly high and patients are unlikely to use a drug product that is not reimbursed by their government. 
Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 5 full-time employees, 3 full-time consultants and 3 part-time consultants, all located in the United States. Of these employees and consultants, seven were engaged in research and development and four were engaged in general and administrative functions. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
