ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL
 
Background and Strategy
 
We were founded in 1986 as a provider of expedited freight transportation, primarily using two-person driver teams in transcontinental lanes. Since that time, we have grown from 25 tractors to approximately 2,300 tractors and expanded our services to include a wide array of transportation and logistics services for our customers. The expansion of our fleet and service offerings have placed us among the nation's twenty-five largest truckload transportation companies based on 2021 revenue. We are strategically focused on continuing to integrate into the supply chain of our customers and reducing our seasonal and cyclical volatility. Our 2018 acquisition of Landair Holdings, Inc., Landair Transport, Inc., Landair Logistics, Inc., and Landair Leasing, Inc., (“Landair”), is an example of that commitment. Landair is a leading dedicated truckload carrier and supplier of transportation management, warehousing, and logistics inventory management systems.
 
As our fleet has grown over three and a half decades and our service platform matured, several important trends dramatically affected the truckload industry and our business. First, supply chain patterns became more fluid in response to dynamic changes in labor and transportation costs, ocean freight and rail-intermodal service standards, retail distribution center networks, governmental regulations, and other industry-wide factors. Second, the cost structure of the truckload business rose dramatically, particularly equipment, driver wages, insurance premiums, and, at times, fuel prices, impacting us and our customers' freight decisions. Third, customers used technology to constantly optimize their supply chains, which necessitated expanding our own technological capability to optimize our asset allocation, manage yields, and drive operational efficiency. Fourth, a confluence of regulatory constraints, safety and security demands, and scarcity of qualified driver applicants, negatively impacted our asset productivity and reinforced what a precious resource professional truck drivers are (and we believe increasingly will be) in our industry.

In 2020, we implemented a number of operational adjustments as part of our strategic plan, including: 1) the disposition of three separate facilities within our terminal network, 2) a fleet reduction of approximately 600 tractors and 1,100 trailers, 3) the disposition and discontinuation of our Factoring reportable segment and 4) a reduction in force of our non-driver employees. As a result of these strategic changes, it is difficult to compare 2020 to other years. We are proud of the operational improvements we have made, especially in light of headwinds we faced around the COVID-19 pandemic, rising casualty insurance costs and the challenging supply shortage of professional drivers. We believe we have made significant progress in achieving our strategic plan, but remain focused on seven initiatives that fall under the following key tenets:
 
●     Organizational Excellence and Entrepreneurial Spirit. In 2021, we made further refinements to our management team, added talent, and implemented additional best practices to bring a new focus to metrics, accountability and ownership. 
 
●     Focus on the Driver. Drivers are the lifeblood of our company and our industry. We employ a broad range of safety, lifestyle, compensation, equipment technology, and personal recognition methods to convey our respect and appreciation for our drivers and to improve their careers. A portion of these techniques involve analytics to identify likely candidates, match teams, evaluate recruiting spending, deliver training content to drivers, and design tractor specifications. 
 
●     Focus on the Customer Experience. We offer premium service in sectors where we can make a difference, and we use our brokerage services to cover loads that cannot be as efficiently serviced through our asset based transportation services. With each interaction, we seek to enhance the value we bring to the customer relationship.
 
●    Rigorous Capital Allocation Process. Our senior management evaluates capital investment opportunities against available capital and acceptable leverage levels, and material investments must pass return on investment and capital investment committee approval processes. Our leverage ratio decreased in both 2021 and 2020 as compared to the respective prior years, as we remain focused on investing capital when we can obtain acceptable returns while maintaining our current leverage. We believe our disciplined investment review has contributed to our improved results by allocating capital to more profitable business units and downsizing other units into greater profitability. In the first quarter of 2022, due to our improved results, we have implemented a quarterly cash dividend program of $0.0625 per share, subject to quarterly approval by our Board of Directors, and adopted a 10b5-1 plan for the purchase of up to $30.0 million in shares subject to defined trading parameters, under our current stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $38.0 million of our Class A common stock.
 
●    Risk Management—Assess and Mitigate. We evaluate risk areas with significant volatility, as well as the costs and benefits associated with mitigating the volatility. Diesel fuel prices, interest rates, insurance and claims cost, and used equipment prices are all areas where we identified significant risk and volatility for our business. To manage these risks, we have at times employed fuel hedging contracts on a portion of our fuel usage not covered by customer fuel surcharges, maintain lower self-insured accident liability retention when economically feasible, and expanded our ability to sell our used equipment to increase bargaining power with the tractor and trailer manufacturers.
 
●   Technology. We purchase and deploy technology that we believe will allow us to operate more safely, securely, and efficiently. Our operational information systems are tailored to the needs of our various service offerings, utilizing software developed internally and purchased off-the-shelf depending on the operational needs. We will continue to seek out technology to improve efficiencies and expand our resources while still providing enterprise wide visibility for critical operating functions.
●   Safety. The Company experienced its safest year on record in 2021, as measured by accident rates. The DOT accident rate per million miles, as defined by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ("FMCSA"), decreased 11% year over year and was the lowest in the Company’s history. The critical accident rate per million miles, certain accident types defined internally by the Company, decreased 17% year over year and was the lowest in the Company’s history. We believe that the key to the improved safety results is a combination of continual training, consistent and proactive coaching, utilizing proven safety technologies, and consistent collaboration between all of our business units. Also, the expansion of our safety training program is expected to allow us to further increase new driver training, provide specific training, and sustain consistent messaging around the culture of safety.  We are looking forward in the coming year to be part of several pilot programs, including the Safe Driver Apprenticeship Program and a new pilot with E-Smart, an advanced driver assistance system. We also have developed a robust 2022 enterprise safety tactical plan that will continue to drive sustainability across our enterprise.
 
We believe the ongoing execution of our strategic plan has contributed to the substantial improvement in operating results and profitability we have generated over the past several years. Some of the significant successes resulting from our strategic planning efforts include the Landair Acquisition in 2018; consolidation of our back-office operations; enhancements to recruiting, retention, and business intelligence; upgraded information technology; focus on service and on time delivery; and sale of TFS. Each of these accomplishments positively impacted the success of the key initiatives identified above, our overarching financial goals, and ultimately, the Company. However, we still have significant work ahead to achieve our goals, deliver a strong and stable product for our customers, provide a bright future for our employees and independent contractors, and create meaningful value for our stockholders.
 
The Company
 
We operate a relatively new tractor fleet and employ sophisticated tractor technology that enhances our operational efficiencies and our drivers' safety. Our company-owned tractor fleet has an average age of approximately 2.1 years, compared to an average U.S. Class 8 tractor age of approximately 7.3 years in 2019. Some of the technologies we employ include the following: (1) freight optimization software that can perform sophisticated analyses of profitability and other measures on each customer, route, and load; (2) routing software that selects the best route, identifies fuel stops, and warns of deviations from routing instructions; (3) a tracking and communications system that permits direct communication between drivers and fleet managers, as well as constant location and delivery updates; (4) electronic logging devices (“ELDs”) in all of our tractors; (5) aerodynamics and other fuel efficiency systems that have significantly improved fuel mileage; and (6) safety technology, including rollover stability control, collision mitigation, adaptive cruise control, and lane-change warning. We believe our modern fleet lowers maintenance costs, improves fuel mileage, improves safety, contributes to better customer service, and assists with driver retention.

Reportable Operating Segments and Service Offerings
 
Our asset based transportation services include two separate reportable operating segments: (i) Expedited and (ii) Dedicated, both of which transport full trailer loads of freight from origin to destination with minimal intermediate stops or handling. We provide truckload transportation services primarily throughout the continental United States utilizing equipment we own or lease or equipment owned by independent contractors. Our Expedited reportable operating segment transports freight over nonroutine routes. Our Dedicated reportable operating segment provides similar transportation services, but does so pursuant to agreements whereby we make our equipment available to a specific customer for shipments over particular routes at specified times. 
 
To complement our asset based transportation services, we also offer non-asset based or asset light logistics services through our Managed Freight reportable operating segment. Our Managed Freight reportable operating segment relies heavily on technology and provides: (i) freight brokerage ("Brokerage") and (ii) transportation management services (“TMS”) to our customers.
 
Lastly, to further our goal of becoming more critical throughout the supply chain, we offer day-to-day warehouse management services through our Warehousing reportable segment. At this point we own no Warehouse facilities but either lease space coterminous with the underlying customer contract or manage the customer's facility.
 
Our combined asset based and non-asset based capabilities, allow us to transport many types of freight for a diverse customer base. We concentrate on service offerings where we believe our capacity in relation to sector size and our operating proficiency can make a meaningful difference to customers. The primary service offerings are further described below:
 

● | Expedited: In our Expedited business, we operate approximately 850 tractors substantially all of which are driven by two-person driver teams. The Expedited reportable operating segment primarily provides truckload services to customers with high service freight and delivery standards, such as 1,000 miles in 22 hours, or 15-minute delivery windows. Expedited services generally require two-person driver teams on equipment either owned or leased by the Company.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dedicated: In our Dedicated business, we operate approximately 1,450 tractors, substantially all of which are driven by a solo driver. The Dedicated segment provides customers with committed truckload capacity over contracted periods with the goal of three to five years in length. Equipment is either owned or leased by the Company. Many of our Dedicated contract customers are automotive companies or shippers of produce, where the nature of the product we ship requires high service standards.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Managed Freight: Our Managed Freight business, includes our brokerage services and TMS. Brokerage services provide logistics capacity by outsourcing the carriage of customers' freight to third parties. TMS provides comprehensive logistics services on a contractual basis to customers who prefer to outsource their logistics needs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Warehousing: The Warehousing segment provides day-to-day warehouse management services to customers who have chosen to outsource this function. We also provide shuttle and switching services related to shuttling containers and trailers in or around freight yards and to/from warehouses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, we participate in the market for used equipment sales and leasing through our 49% ownership of Transport Enterprise Leasing, LLC (“TEL”). 
 
The following table reflects the size of each of our reportable segments measured by 2021 total revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue, which we refer to as "freight revenue":
 

Distribution of Freight Revenue Among Service Offerings
-------------------------------------------------------
Expedited | 32 | %
Dedicated | 31 | %
Managed Freight | 31 | %
Warehousing | 6 | %
Total | 100 | %

 
In our Expedited and Dedicated segments, we generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers. Generally, we are paid a predetermined rate per mile for our truckload services. We enhance our truckload revenue by charging for tractor and trailer detention, loading and unloading activities, and other specialized services, as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel. The main factors that could affect our Expedited and Dedicated revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, and the number of shipments and miles we generate. These factors relate, among other things, to the general level of economic activity in the United States, inventory levels, specific customer demand, the level of truck capacity in the trucking industry, and driver availability.
 
The main expenses that impact the profitability of our Expedited and Dedicated segments are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers. These costs include fuel expenses, driver-related expenses, such as wages, benefits, training, and recruitment, and purchased transportation expenses, which primarily include compensating independent contractors. Expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, self-insured retention versus insurance premiums, fleet age, efficiency, and other factors. Historically, our main fixed costs include rentals and depreciation of long-term assets, such as revenue equipment and terminal facilities, and the compensation of non-driver personnel.
 
We measure the productivity of our Expedited segment with three key performance metrics: average freight revenue per total mile (excluding fuel surcharges), average miles per tractor and average freight revenue per tractor per week. We primarily measure the productivity of our Dedicated segment with the average freight revenue per tractor per week metric. A description of each follows:
 
Average Freight Revenue Per Total Mile. Our average freight revenue per total mile is primarily a function of 1) the allocation of assets among our subsidiaries, 2) the macro U.S. economic environment including supply/demand of freight and carriers, and 3) individual negotiations with customers.
Average Miles Per Tractor. Average miles per tractor reflect 1) economic demand, 2) driver availability, 3) regulatory constraints, and 4) the allocation of tractors among the service offerings.
 
    6 

  

Average Freight Revenue Per Tractor Per Week. We use average freight revenue per tractor per week as our main measure of asset productivity. This operating metric accumulates the effects of freight rates, non-revenue miles, and miles per tractor. In addition, because we calculate average freight revenue per tractor using all of our tractors, it takes into account the percentage of our fleet that is unproductive due to lack of drivers, repairs, and other factors.
 
A summary of these metrics for our Expedited segment for 2021 and 2020 is as follows:
 

 | 2021 | | 2020 | 
---------------------------------------------+------+---------+------+--
Average freight revenue per total mile | $ | 1.97 | | $ | 1.82 
Average miles per tractor | | 172,080 | | | 144,636
Average freight revenue per tractor per week | $ | 6,498 | | $ | 5,031 

 
A summary of the key performance metrics for our Dedicated segment for 2021 and 2020 is as follows:
 

 | 2021 | | 2020 | 
---------------------------------------------+------+--------+------+--
Average freight revenue per total mile | $ | 2.19 | | $ | 1.88 
Average miles per tractor | | 81,284 | | | 85,284
Average freight revenue per tractor per week | $ | 3,417 | | $ | 3,066 

 
Within our Managed Freight segment, we derive revenue from providing Brokerage and TMS services, particularly arranging transportation services for customers directly and through relationships with thousands of third-party carriers and integration with our Expedited segment. Additionally, utilizing technology and process management to provide detailed visibility into a customer’s movement of freight – inbound and outbound – throughout the customer’s network providing focused customer support through multi-year contracts. We provide Brokerage services directly and through agents, who are paid a commission for the freight they provide. The main factors that impact profitability in terms of expenses are the variable costs of outsourcing the transportation freight for our customers and managing fixed costs, including salaries, facility warehousing costs, and selling, general, and administrative expenses.
 
Within our Warehousing segment we empower customers to outsource warehousing management including moving containers and trailers in or around freight yards. The main factors that impact profitability in terms of expenses are managing fixed costs, including salaries, facility warehousing costs, and selling, general, and administrative expenses.
 
In May 2011, we acquired a 49.0% interest in TEL. TEL is a tractor and trailer equipment leasing company and used equipment reseller. We have accounted for our investment in TEL using the equity method of accounting and thus our financial results include our proportionate share of TEL's net income since May 2011, or $14.8 million in 2021 and $3.9 million in 2020.
 
Refer to Note 15, "Segment Information," of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our reporting segment's operating and financial results.
 
Customers and Operations
 
We focus on targeted markets throughout the United States where we believe our service standards can provide a competitive advantage. We are a major carrier for transportation companies such as parcel freight forwarders, less-than-truckload carriers, and third-party logistics providers that require a high level of service to support their businesses, as well as for traditional truckload customers such as manufacturers, retailers, and food and beverage shippers. 
 
We had no customers and one customer that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Such customer for 2020 was serviced by our Expedited, Dedicated, and Managed Freight segments. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 53% and 48% of our total revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
Within our asset based transportation service offerings (Expedited and Dedicated), we operate tractors driven by a single driver and also tractors assigned to two-person driver teams. Our single driver tractors generally operate in shorter lengths of haul, generate fewer miles per tractor, and experience more non-revenue miles, but the lower productive miles are expected to be offset by generally higher revenue per loaded mile and the reduced employee expense of compensating only one driver. In contrast, our two-person driver tractors generally operate in longer lengths of haul, generate greater miles per tractor, and experience fewer non-revenue miles, but we typically receive lower revenue per loaded mile and incur higher employee expenses of compensating both drivers. We expect operating statistics and expenses to shift with the mix of single and team operations.
 
Our reportable segments operate on a variety of operating systems to maximize the effectiveness of the unique attributes associated with each service offering. We have one primary financial system and continue to focus on cloud based solutions for data storage versus storing on local servers when possible. We continue to evaluate where we can leverage technology to add further efficiencies across the Company and for our customers.

Drivers and Other Personnel
 
Driver recruitment, retention, and satisfaction are essential to our success, and we have made each of these factors a primary element of our strategy. We recruit both experienced and student drivers as well as independent contractor drivers who own and drive their own tractor and provide their services to us under contract. We conduct recruiting and/or driver orientation efforts from four of our locations, and we offer ongoing training throughout our terminal network. We emphasize driver-friendly operations throughout our organization. We have implemented automated programs to signal when a driver is scheduled to be routed toward home, and we assign fleet managers specific tractors, regardless of geographic region, to foster positive relationships between the drivers and their principal contact with us.
 
The truckload industry has experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining enough qualified truck drivers. It is also common for the driver turnover rate of individual carriers to exceed 100% in a year. At times, there are driver shortages in the trucking industry. In past years, when there were driver shortages, the number of qualified drivers had not kept pace with freight growth because of (i) changes in the demographic composition of the workforce; (ii) alternative employment opportunities other than truck driving that became available in a growing economy; (iii) individual drivers' desire to be home more often; and (iv) regulatory requirements that limit the available pool of drivers.
 
Despite our reduced fleet, driver recruitment and retention remained extremely challenging in 2021, as the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to slow the ability to train, test, and license drivers. Other employment opportunities have attracted professional drivers away from trucking. Our average number of teams as a percentage of our fleet increased for 2021 as compared to 2020. Our average open tractors, including wrecked tractors, increased to 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021, from approximately 4.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
 
We believe having a happy, healthy, and safe driver is the key to our success, both in the short term and over a longer period. As a result, we are actively working to enhance our drivers' experience in an effort to recruit and retain more drivers.
 
Independent contractors provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile. We do not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractor. The payments to independent contractors are recorded in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation. When independent contractor tractors are utilized, we avoid expenses generally associated with company-owned equipment, such as driver compensation, fuel, interest, and depreciation. Obtaining equipment from independent contractors and under operating leases effectively shifts financing expenses from interest to "above the line" operating expenses.
 
We continue to educate our drivers and non-driver personnel regarding the FMCSA Compliance Safety Accountability program ("CSA"). We believe CSA, in conjunction with other U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") regulations, including those related to hours-of-service and ELDs, has reduced and will likely continue to impact effective capacity in our industry as well as negatively impact equipment utilization. Nevertheless, for carriers that are able to successfully manage this regulation-laden environment with driver-friendly equipment, compensation, and operations, we believe opportunities to increase market share may be available. Driver pay may increase as a result of regulation and economic expansion, which could provide more alternative employment opportunities. If economic growth is sustained, however, we expect the supply/demand environment to be favorable enough for us to offset expected compensation increases with better freight pricing.
 
We use driver teams in a substantial portion of our tractors. Driver teams permit us to provide expedited service on selected long haul lanes because teams are able to handle longer routes and drive more miles while remaining within DOT hours-of-service rules. The use of teams contributes to greater equipment utilization of the tractors they drive than obtained with single drivers. The use of teams, however, increases the accumulation of miles on tractors and trailers, personnel costs as a percentage of revenue, and the number of drivers we must recruit.
 
We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. At December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,000 drivers and approximately 1,500 non-driver personnel. At December 31, 2021, we engaged 159 independent contractor drivers.

Revenue Equipment
 
At December 31, 2021, we operated 2,291 tractors and 5,331 trailers. Of such tractors, 1,467 tractors were owned, 665 tractors were financed under operating leases, and 159 tractors were provided by independent contractors, who own and drive their own tractors. Of such trailers, 4,607 trailers were owned, 103 trailers were financed under an operating lease or as short-term rentals, and 621 trailers were financed under finance leases. Furthermore, at December 31, 2021, approximately 79% of our trailers were dry vans, and the remaining trailers were refrigerated vans.
 
We believe that operating high quality, late-model equipment contributes to operating efficiency, helps us recruit and retain drivers, and is an important part of providing excellent service to customers. We operate a modern fleet of tractors, with the majority of tractors under warranty, to minimize repair and maintenance costs and reduce service interruptions caused by breakdowns. We also order most of our equipment with uniform specifications to reduce our parts inventory and facilitate maintenance. At December 31, 2021, our tractor fleet had an average age of approximately 2.1 years, and our trailer fleet had an average age of approximately 5.1 years. We equip our tractors with a satellite-based tracking and communications system that permits direct communication between drivers and fleet managers. We believe that this system enhances our operating efficiency and improves customer service and fleet management. This system also updates the tractor's position approximately every fifteen minutes, which allows us and our customers to locate freight and accurately estimate pick-up and delivery times. We also use the system to monitor engine idling time, speed, performance, and other factors that affect operating efficiency. At December 31, 2021, all of our tractors were equipped with ELDs, which electronically monitor tractor miles and facilitate enforcement of hours-of-service regulations.
 
Over the past decade, the price of new tractors has risen dramatically and there has been significant volatility in the used equipment market. This has substantially increased our costs of operation. Currently, tractor and trailer manufacturers are experiencing significant shortages of semiconductor chips and other component parts and supplies, including steel, forcing many manufacturers to curtail or suspend their production, which has led to a lower supply of tractors and trailers, higher prices, and lengthened trade cycles, and which could lead to, among other things, higher maintenance expense and driver retention.
 
Industry and Competition 
 
Truckload is the largest segment of the for-hire ground freight transportation market based on revenue, surpassing the combined market size of less-than-truckload, railroad, intermodal, and parcel delivery combined. The truckload market is further segmented into sectors such as regional dry van, temperature-controlled van, flatbed, dedicated contract, expedited, and irregular route.
 
The U.S. trucking industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of "for-hire" motor carriers, none of which dominate the market. Service and price are the principal means of competition in the trucking industry. We compete to some extent with railroads and rail-truck intermodal service but attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competition on the basis of service. Rail and rail-truck intermodal movements are more often subject to delays and disruptions arising from rail yard congestion, which reduce the effectiveness of such service to customers with time-definite pick-up and delivery schedules. Historically, in times of high fuel prices or decreased consumer demand, however, rail-intermodal competition has been more significant.
 
Our industry is subject to dynamic factors that significantly affect our operating results. These factors include the availability of qualified truck drivers, the volume of freight in the sectors we serve, the price of diesel fuel, and government regulations that impact productivity and costs. Recently, our industry has experienced volatile freight demand, increased fuel costs, tight new and used equipment market, scarcity of qualified truck drivers, and regulations that limit productivity. In 2021, the rates increased from 2020, and costs such as driver pay also increased. For at least the first few months of 2022, we anticipate a strong freight market accompanied by constrained capacity due to a national driver and equipment shortage. We expect cost pressure to persist even if freight demand moderates. We believe large and diversified companies, like ourselves, are best positioned to capitalize on the current industry environment, because we can offer significant capacity commitments to major customers, safe and comfortable new equipment to drivers, and optimized routing and other business analytics to make the most of our drivers' federally limited operating hours.
 
We believe that the cost and complexity of operating trucking fleets are increasing and that economic and competitive pressures are likely to force many smaller competitors and private fleets to consolidate or exit the industry. As a result, we believe that larger, better-capitalized companies, like us, will have opportunities to increase profit margins and gain market share. In the market for dedicated services, we believe that truckload carriers, like us, have a competitive advantage over truck lessors, which are the other major participants in the market, because we expect to be able to offer lower prices by utilizing back-haul freight within our network that traditional lessors may not have.

Regulation
 
Transportation Regulations
 
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various U.S. agencies. Our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of-service. Such matters as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to U.S. regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions, drivers' hours-of-service, ergonomics, or other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS"), and the U.S. Department of Defense also regulate our equipment, operations, drivers, and environment.
 
The DOT, through the FMCSA, imposes safety and fitness regulations on us and our drivers, including rules that restrict driver hours-of-service. Changes to such hours-of-service rules can negatively impact our productivity and affect our operations and profitability by reducing the number of hours per day or week our drivers may operate and/or disrupting our network. However, in August 2019, the FMCSA issued a proposal to make changes to its hours-of-service rules that would allow truck drivers more flexibility with their 30-minute rest break and with dividing their time in the sleeper berth. It also would extend by two hours the duty time for drivers encountering adverse weather, and extend the shorthaul exemption by lengthening the drivers’ maximum on-duty period from 12 hours to 14 hours. In June 2020, the FMCSA adopted a final rule substantially as proposed, which became effective in September 2020. Certain industry groups have challenged these rules in court, and it remains unclear what, if anything, will come from such challenges. Any future changes to hours-of-service rules could materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability.
 
The DOT uses two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers. The first method is the application of a safety rating that is based on an onsite investigation and affects a carrier’s ability to operate in interstate commerce. All of our subsidiaries with operating authority currently have a satisfactory DOT safety rating under this method, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we received a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could adversely affect our business, as some of our existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating. In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining a revised safety rating measurement system which would replace the current methodology. Under the proposed rule, the current three safety ratings of "satisfactory," "conditional," and "unsatisfactory" would be replaced with a single safety rating of "unfit." Thus, a carrier with no rating would be deemed fit. Moreover, data from roadside inspections and the results of all investigations would be used to determine a carrier’s fitness on a monthly basis. This would replace the current methodology of determining a carrier’s fitness based solely on infrequent comprehensive onsite reviews. The proposed rule underwent a public comment period that ended in June 2016 and several industry groups and lawmakers expressed their disagreement with the proposed rule, arguing that it violates the requirements of the FAST Act (as defined below) and that the FMCSA must first finalize its review of the CSA scoring system, described in further detail below. Based on this feedback and other concerns raised by industry stakeholders, in March 2017, the FMCSA withdrew the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to the new safety rating system. In its notice of withdrawal, the FMCSA noted that a new rulemaking related to a similar process may be initiated in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when, or under what form any such rule could be implemented. The FMCSA also indicated that it is in the early phases of a new study on the causation of crashes. Although it remains unclear whether such study will ultimately be completed, the results of such study could spur further proposed and/or final rules in regards to safety and fitness.
 
In addition to the safety rating system, the FMCSA has adopted the CSA program as an additional safety enforcement and compliance model that evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards. The CSA program analyzes data from roadside inspections, moving violations, crash reports from the last two years, and investigation results. The data is organized into seven categories. Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (e.g., crashes, inspections, or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold. Currently, these scores do not have a direct impact on a carrier’s safety rating. However, the occurrence of unfavorable scores in one or more categories may (i) affect driver recruiting and retention by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers, (ii) cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet rankings, (iii) subject us to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, (iv) cause us to incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores or (v) increase our insurance costs, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
 
Under the CSA, these scores were initially made available to the public in five of the seven categories. However, pursuant to the, Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (the "FAST Act"), which was signed into law in December 2015, the FMCSA was required to remove from public view the previously available CSA scores while it reviews the reliability of the scoring system. During this period of review by the FMCSA, we will continue to have access to our own scores and will still be subject to intervention by the FMCSA when such scores are above the intervention thresholds. A study was conducted and delivered to the FMCSA in June 2017 with several recommendations to make the CSA program more fair, accurate, and reliable. In June 2018, the FMCSA provided a report to Congress outlining the changes it may make to the CSA program in response to the study. Such changes include the testing and possible adoption of a revised risk modeling theory, potential collection and dissemination of additional carrier data and revised measures for intervention thresholds. The adoption of such changes is contingent on the results of the new modeling theory and additional public feedback. Therefore, it is unclear if, when and to what extent such changes to the CSA program will occur. However, any changes that increase the likelihood of us receiving unfavorable scores could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
 
 In May 2020 the FMCSA announced that effective immediately it is making permanent a pilot program that will not count a crash in which a motor carrier was not at fault when calculating the carrier’s safety measurement profile, called the Crash Preventability Demonstration Program (“CPDP”). The CPDP will expand the types of eligible crashes, modify the Safety Measurement System to exclude crashes with not preventable determinations from the prioritization algorithm and note the not preventable determinations in the Pre-Employment Screening Program. Under the program, carriers with eligible crashes that occurred on or after August 2019, may submit a Request for Data Review with the required police accident report and other supporting documents, photos or videos through the FMCSA’s DataQs website. If the FMCSA determines the crash was not preventable, it will be listed on the Safety Measurement System but not included when calculating a carrier’s Crash Indicator Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Category measure in SMS. Additionally, the not preventable determinations will be noted on a driver’s Pre-Employment Screening Program report. 
 
Currently, certain of our subsidiaries are exceeding the established intervention thresholds in one or more of the seven categories of CSA, in comparison to their peer groups; however, they all continue to maintain a satisfactory rating with the DOT. We will continue to promote improvement of these scores in all seven categories with ongoing reviews of all safety-related policies, programs, and procedures for their effectiveness.

The FMCSA published a final rule in December 2015 that required the use of ELDs or automatic on board recording devices (“AOBRs”) by nearly all carriers by December 2017 (the "2015 ELD Rule"). Use of AOBRs was permitted until December 2019, at which time use of ELDs became required. We ultimately had ELDs (not AOBRs) installed on 100% of our fleet by the December 2019 deadline. We believe that more effective hours-of-service enforcement under the 2015 ELD Rule may improve our competitive position by causing all carriers to adhere more closely to hours-of-service requirements and may further reduce industry capacity.
 
In December 2016, the FMCSA issued a final rule establishing a national clearinghouse for drug and alcohol testing results and requiring motor carriers and medical review officers to provide records of violations by commercial drivers of FMCSA drug and alcohol testing requirements. Motor carriers are required to query the clearinghouse to ensure drivers and driver applicants do not have violations of federal drug and alcohol testing regulations that prohibit them from operating commercial motor vehicles. The final rule became effective in January 2017, with a compliance date in January 2020. In December 2019, however, the FMCSA announced a final rule extending by three years the date for state driver’s licensing agencies to comply with certain Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse requirements. The December 2016 commercial driver’s license rule required states to request information from the Clearinghouse about individuals prior to issuing, renewing, upgrading, or transferring to a CDL. This new action will allow states’ compliance with the requirement, which was set to begin January 2020, to be delayed until January 2023. That being said, the FMCSA has indicated that it will allow states the option to voluntarily query Clearinghouse information beginning January 2020. The compliance date of January 2020 remained in place for all other requirements set forth in the Clearinghouse final rule, however. Upon implementation, the rule may reduce the number of available drivers in an already constrained driver market. Pursuant to a new rule finalized by the FMCSA, effective November 2021, states are required to query the Clearinghouse when issuing, renewing, transferring, or upgrading a commercial driver's license and must revoke a driver's commercial driving privileges if such driver is prohibited from driving a motor vehicle for one or more drug or alcohol violations.
 
In September 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) announced proposed mandatory guidelines to allow employers to drug test truck drivers and other federal workers for pre-employment and random testing using hair specimens. However, the proposal also requires a second sample using either urine or an oral swab test if a hair test is positive, if a donor is unable to provide a sufficient amount of hair for faith-based or medical reasons, or due to an insufficient amount or length of hair. The proposal specifically requires that the second test be done simultaneously at the collection event or when directed by the medical review officer after review and verification of laboratory-reported results for the hair specimen. DHHS indicated the two-test approach is intended to protect federal workers from issues that have been identified as limitations of hair testing, and related legal deficiencies identified in two prior court cases. The American Trucking Associations (“ATA”) has voiced concerns with the new guidelines, characterizing them as “weak” and “misguided,” and specially taking issue with the second sample requirement, which the ATA feels diminishes the value of hair testing. It is unclear if, and when, a final rule may be put in place. Any final rule may reduce the number of available drivers. We currently perform urine testing and will continue monitor any developments in this area to ensure compliance.
 
Other rules have been recently proposed or made final by the FMCSA, including (i) a rule requiring the use of speed limiting devices on heavy duty tractors to restrict maximum speeds, which was proposed in 2016, and (ii) a rule setting forth minimum driver training standards for new drivers applying for commercial driver’s licenses for the first time and to experienced drivers upgrading their licenses or seeking a hazardous materials endorsement, which was made final in December 2016, with a compliance date in February 2020. However, in May 2020, the FMCSA approved an interim rule delaying implementation of the final rule by two years, which extends the compliance date to February 2022. In July 2017, the DOT announced that it would no longer pursue a speed limiter rule, but left open the possibility that it could resume such a pursuit in the future. In May 2021, however, the Cullum Owings Large Truck Safe Operating Speed Act was reintroduced into the U.S. House of Representatives and would require commercial motor vehicles with a gross weight of more than 26,000 pounds to be equipped with a speed limiter that would limit the vehicle’s speed to no more than 65 M.P.H. The effect of these rules, to the extent they become effective, could result in a decrease in driver availability, which could adversely affect our business or operations.
 
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), signed into law by President Biden in November 2021, created an apprenticeship program for drivers younger than 21 to eventually qualify to drive commercial trucks in interstate commerce. The provision drew certain mechanics from the bills introduced in Congress in 2019 related to lowering the age requirements for interstate commercial driving. The FMCSA announced the establishment of this apprenticeship program in January 2022 in an effort to help the industry’s ongoing driver shortage. The program is open to 18 to 20-year-old drivers who already hold intrastate commercial driver's licenses and sets a strict training regimen for participating drivers and carriers to comply with. Motor carriers interested in participating must complete an application for participation and submit monthly data on an apprentice’s driver activity, safety outcomes, and additional supporting information. It remains unclear whether any regulatory changes will stem from the apprenticeship program.
 
In December 2018, the FMCSA granted a petition filed by the ATA and in doing so determined that federal law does preempt California’s wage and hour laws, and interstate truck drivers are not subject to such laws. The FMCSA’s decision has been appealed by labor groups and multiple lawsuits have been filed in federal courts seeking to overturn the decision. In January 2021, the Ninth Circuit upheld the FMCSA's determination that federal law does preempt California's meal and rest break laws, as applied to drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles. Other current and future state and local laws, including laws related to employee meal breaks and rest periods, may also vary significantly from federal law. Further, driver piece rate compensation, which is an industry standard, has been attacked as non-compliant with state minimum wage laws and lawsuits have recently been filed and/or adjudicated against carriers demanding compensation for sleeper berth time, layovers, rest breaks and pre-trip and post-trip inspections, the outcome of which could have major implications for the treatment of time that drivers spend off-duty (whether in a truck’s sleeper berth or otherwise) under applicable wage laws. Both of these issues are adversely impacting the Company and the industry as a whole, with respect to the practical application of the laws, thereby resulting in additional cost. As a result, we, along with other companies in the industry, could become subject to an uneven patchwork of laws throughout the United States. In the past, certain legislators have proposed federal legislation to preempt certain state and local laws; however, passage of such legislation is uncertain. If federal legislation is not passed, we will either need to comply with the most restrictive state and local laws across our entire network, or overhaul our management systems to comply with varying state and local laws. Either solution could result in increased compliance and labor costs, driver turnover, decreased efficiency, and amplified legal exposure.
 
 Tax and other regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have increasingly asserted that independent contractors in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors, for a variety of purposes, including income tax withholding, workers' compensation, wage and hour compensation, unemployment, and other issues. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for those that engage independent contractors and to heighten the penalties of companies who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees' overtime and/or wage requirements. The most recent example being the Protecting the Rights to Organize ("PRO") Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives and received by the Senate in March 2021 and remains with the Senate's Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The PRO Act proposes to apply the "ABC Test" for classifying workers under Federal Fair Labor Standards Act claims. It is unknown whether any of the proposed legislation will become law or whether any industry-based exemptions from any resulting law will be granted. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors, and impose notice requirements based upon employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers' compensation, and income taxes, and a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with these initiatives.  
 
    11 

  

Recently, courts in certain states have issued decisions that could result in a greater likelihood that independent contractors would be judicially classified as employees in such states. In September 2019, California enacted A.B. 5 (“AB5”), a new law that changed the landscape of the state’s treatment of employees and independent contractors. AB5 provides that the three-pronged “ABC Test” must be used to determine worker classification in wage-order claims. Under the ABC Test, a worker is presumed to be an employee, and the burden to demonstrate their independent contractor status is on the hiring company through satisfying all three of the following criteria:
 

● | the worker is free from control and direction in the performance of services; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the worker is performing work outside the usual course of business of the hiring company; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
How AB5 will be enforced is still to be determined. In January 2021, however, the California Supreme Court ruled that the ABC Test could apply retroactively to all cases not yet final as of the date the original decision was rendered, April 2018. While AB5 was set to go into effect in January 2020, a federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of AB5 on the trucking industry while the California Trucking Association (“CTA”) moves forward with its suit seeking to invalidate AB5. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the reasoning behind the injunction in April 2021, ruling that AB5 is not pre-empted by federal law, but granted a stay of the AB5 mandate in June 2021 (preventing its application and temporarily continuing the injunction) while the CTA petitioned the United States Supreme Court (the “Supreme Court”) to review the decision. In November 2021, the Supreme Court requested that the U.S. solicitor general weigh in on the case. The injunction will remain in place until the Supreme Court makes a decision on whether to proceed in hearing the case. While the stay of the AB5 mandate provides temporary relief to the enforcement of AB5, it remains unclear how long such relief will last, and whether the CTA will ultimately be successful in invalidating the law. It is also possible AB5 will spur similar legislation in states other than California, which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
 
Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against certain members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers' compensation and health care coverage. In addition, companies that utilize lease-purchase independent contractor programs, such as us, have been more susceptible to reclassification lawsuits and several recent decisions have been made in favor of those seeking to classify as employees certain independent contractors that participated in lease-purchase programs. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. Our classification of independent contractors has been the subject of audits by such authorities from time to time. While we have been successful in continuing to classify our independent contractor drivers as independent contractors and not employees, we may be unsuccessful in defending that position in the future. If our independent contractors are determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, air emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine idling, and discharge and retention of storm water. Our tractor terminals often are located in industrial areas where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Certain of our facilities have waste oil or fuel storage tanks, and fueling islands. A certain portion of our freight consists of low-grade hazardous substances, which subjects us to a wide array of regulations, and another portion consists of high security cargo such as arms, ammunition, and explosives, which subjects us to a myriad of regulatory requirements concerning the storage, handling and transportation of hazardous materials, chemicals, and explosives. Accidents or malfeasance involving these services or cargo, or a failure of a product (including as a result of cyberattack), could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability. Additionally, increasing efforts to control emissions of greenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on us. Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport, if soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to cleanup costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.
 
In August 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") and the EPA adopted final rules that established the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium-and heavy-duty vehicles, including the tractors we employ (the "Phase 1 Standards"). The Phase 1 Standards apply to tractor model years 2014 to 2018 and require the achievement of an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption by the 2018 model year, which equates to approximately four gallons of fuel for every 100 miles traveled. In addition, in February 2014, President Obama announced that his administration would begin developing the next phase of tighter fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for medium-and heavy-duty tractors and trailers (the "Phase 2 Standards"). In October 2016, the EPA and NHTSA published the final rule mandating that the Phase 2 Standards will apply to trailers beginning with model year 2018 and tractors beginning with model year 2021. The Phase 2 Standards require nine percent and 25 percent reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for trailers and tractors, respectively, by 2027. The final rule was effective in December 2016, but has since faced challenges and delays. In October 2017, the EPA announced a proposal to repeal the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to gliders (which mix refurbished older components, including transmissions and pre-emission-rule engines, with a new frame, cab, steer axle, wheels, and other standard equipment). The outcome of such proposal is still undetermined. Additionally, implementation of the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to trailers has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In November 2021, a panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the association challenging the standards and vacated all portions of the Phase 2 Standards that applied to trailers, and consequently, the Phase 2 Standards will only require reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for tractors. The Company’s new tractor purchases in 2021 complied with the emission and fuel consumption reductions required by the Phase 2 Standards. Even though the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 standards have been removed, we will still need to ensure the majority of our fleet is compliant with the California Phase 2 standards.

In January 2020, the EPA announced it is seeking input on reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants from heavy-duty trucks. The EPA is aiming to release proposed rulemaking for the new plan, commonly referred to as the “Cleaner Trucks Initiative,” and anticipates taking final action as soon as 2022. The EPA is targeting 2027 for these new standards to take effect and is also working on enacting more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards (beginning with model year 2030 vehicles) by the end of 2024.
 
The California Air Resources Board ("CARB") also adopted emission control regulations that will be applicable to all heavy-duty tractors that pull 53-foot or longer box-type trailers within the state of California. The tractors and trailers subject to these CARB regulations must be either EPA SmartWay certified or equipped with low-rolling, resistance tires and retrofitted with SmartWay-approved aerodynamic technologies. Enforcement of these CARB regulations for model year 2011 equipment began in January 2010 and have been phased in over several years for older equipment. We currently purchase Smart Way certified equipment in our new tractor and trailer acquisitions. In addition, in February 2017 CARB proposed California Phase 2 standards that generally align with the federal Phase 2 Standards, with some minor additional requirements, and as proposed would stay in place even if the federal Phase 2 Standards are affected. In February 2019, the California Phase 2 standards became final. Thus, even though the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 Standards were removed, we will still need to ensure the majority of our fleet is compliant with the California Phase 2 standards, which may result in increased equipment costs and could adversely affect our operating results and profitability. CARB has also recently announced intentions to adopt regulations ensuring that 100% of tractors operating in California are operating with battery or fuel cell-electric engines in the future. Whether these regulations will ultimately be adopted remains unclear. Federal and state lawmakers also have proposed a variety of other regulatory limits on carbon emissions and fuel consumption. Compliance with these regulations could increase the cost of new tractors and trailers, impair equipment productivity, and increase operating expenses. These effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the operating results that will be produced by the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of these vehicles, could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. In June 2020 CARB also passed the Advanced Clean Trucks (“ACT”) regulation, which became effective in March 2021 and generally requires original equipment manufacturers to begin shifting towards greater production of zero-emission heavy duty tractors starting in 2024. Under ACT, by 2045, every new tractor sold in California will need to be zero-emission. While ACT does not apply to those simply operating tractors in California, it could affect the cost and/or supply of traditional diesel tractors and may lead to similar legislation in other states or at the federal level.
 
In order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle. These restrictions could force us to purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter our drivers' behavior, which could result in a decrease in productivity or increase in driver turnover.
 
Food Safety Regulations
 
In April 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) published a final rule establishing requirements for shippers, loaders, carriers by motor vehicle and rail vehicle, and receivers engaged in the transportation of food, to use sanitary transportation practices to ensure the safety of the food they transport as part of the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 (the "FSMA"). This rule sets forth requirements related to (i) the design and maintenance of equipment used to transport food, (ii) the measures taken during food transportation to ensure food safety, (iii) the training of carrier personnel in sanitary food transportation practices, and (iv) maintenance and retention of records of written procedures, agreements, and training related to the foregoing items. These requirements took effect for larger carriers such as us in April 2017 and are applicable when we perform as a carrier or as a broker. We believe we have been in compliance with these requirements since that time. However, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations related to the FSMA or if we transport food or goods that are contaminated or are found to cause illness and/or death, we could be subject to substantial fines, lawsuits, penalties and/or criminal and civil liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
As the FDA continues its efforts to modernize food safety, it is likely additional food safety regulations will take effect in the future. In July 2020, the FDA released its “New Era of Smarter Food Safety” blueprint, which creates a ten year roadmap to create a more digital, traceable and safer food system. This blueprint builds on the work done under the FSMA, and while it is still unclear what, if any, changes to the current governing framework may ultimately take effect, further regulation in this area could negatively affect our business by increasing our compliance obligations and related expenses going forward.
 
Executive and Legislative Climate
 
It is still to be determined how President Biden’s leadership will impact our industry. That being said, President Biden has indicated his intent to make a green infrastructure package a top priority for his administration. Any measure in furtherance thereof could draw from the Build Back Better Act (the “BBB”), which passed the U.S. House of Representatives, but is facing resistance in the U.S. Senate. As currently proposed, the BBB would impact transportation by allocating funds to address various industry related issues such as port congestion and traffic safety enforcement. The bill also promotes a myriad of low-emission programs, transit services and clean energy projects, as well as funding for climate change research. It is unclear whether these legislative initiatives will be signed into law and what changes they may undergo. However, adoption and implementation could negatively impact our business by increasing our compliance obligations and related expenses.
 
President Biden also has indicated an intention to make substantial changes to the current U.S. tax laws during his administration, including changes to the way capital gains are treated. Any changes to U.S. tax laws may have an adverse impact on our business and profitability. 
 
The United States Mexico Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) was entered into effect in July 2020. The USMCA is designed to modernize food and agriculture trade, advance rules of origin for automobiles and trucks, and enhance intellectual property protections, among other matters, according to the Office of U.S. Trade Representative. It is difficult to predict at this stage what could be the impact of the USMCA on the economy, including the transportation industry. However, given the amount of North American trade that moves by truck, it could have a significant impact on supply and demand in the transportation industry, and could adversely impact the amount, movement, and patterns of freight we transport.
 
The IIJA was signed into law by President Biden in November 2021. The roughly $1.2 trillion bill contains an estimated $550 billion in new spending, which will impact transportation. In particular, it dedicates more than $100 billion for surface transportation networks and roughly $66 billion for freight and passenger rail operations. Among provisions in the law specific to trucking is the aforementioned apprenticeship program for drivers younger than 21 to eventually qualify to drive commercial trucks in interstate commerce. It remains unclear how the IIJA will be implemented into and effect our industry. The IIJA may result in increased compliance and implementation related expenses, which could have a negative impact on our operations. 
 
    13 

  

Given COVID-19’s considerable effect on our industry, the FMCSA issued and/or extended various temporary responsive measures throughout the year. Although, to date, these measures have largely been enacted in order to assist industry participants in operating under adverse circumstances, any further responsive measures remain unclear and could have a negative impact on our operations.
 
 In November 2021 the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) published an emergency temporary standard (the “Emergency Rule”) requiring all employers with at least 100 employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or require any employees who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative COVID-19 test result on at least a weekly basis before coming to work. The Emergency Rule has been blocked by the Supreme Court. Any future vaccination, testing or mask mandates that are allowed to go into effect, could, among other things, (i) cause our unvaccinated employees to go to smaller employers, if such employers are not subject to future mandates, or leave us or the trucking industry, especially our unvaccinated drivers, (ii) result in logistical issues, increased expenses, and operational issues from arranging for weekly tests of our unvaccinated employees, especially our unvaccinated drivers, (iii) result in increased costs for recruiting and retention of drivers, as well as the cost of weekly testing, and (iv) result in decreased revenue if we are unable to recruit and retain drivers. Any vaccination, testing or mask mandates that are interpreted as applying to drivers would significantly reduce the pool of drivers available to us and our industry, which would further impact the extreme shortage of available drivers. Accordingly, any vaccination, testing or mask mandates, if allowed to go into effect, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Fuel Availability and Cost
 The cost of fuel trended higher in 2021 as compared to 2020, as demonstrated by an increase in the Department of Energy ("DOE") national average for diesel to approximately $3.29 per gallon for 2021 compared to $2.55 per gallon for 2020. There were $0.4 million of fuel hedging gains in 2021 compared to $0.3 million of losses in 2020.
 
We actively manage our fuel costs by routing our drivers through fuel centers with which we have negotiated volume discounts and through jurisdictions with lower fuel taxes, where possible. We have also reduced the maximum speed of many of our trucks, implemented strict idling guidelines for our drivers, purchased technology to enhance our management and monitoring of out-of-route miles, encouraged the use of shore power units in truck stops, and imposed standards for accepting broker freight that includes minimum rates and fuel surcharges. These initiatives have contributed to significant improvements in fleet wide average fuel mileage. Moreover, we have a fuel surcharge program in place with the majority of our customers, which has historically enabled us to recover some of the higher fuel costs. However, even with the fuel surcharges, the price of fuel can affect our profitability. Our fuel surcharges are billed on a lagging basis, meaning we typically bill customers in the current week based on a previous week's applicable index. Therefore, in times of increasing fuel prices, we do not recover as much as we are currently paying for fuel. In periods of declining prices, the opposite is true. In addition, we incur additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather, empty or out-of-route miles, and for fuel used by refrigerated trailers that generally is not billed to customers. In addition, from time-to-time customers attempt to modify their surcharge programs, some successfully, which can result in recovery of a smaller portion of fuel price increases. Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a materially adverse effect on our operations or future profitability.
 
To reduce the variability of the ultimate cash flows associated with fluctuations in diesel fuel prices, we have periodically entered into various derivative instruments, including forward futures swap contracts. We have historically entered into hedging contracts with respect to ultra-low sulfur diesel ("ULSD"). Under these contracts, we would pay a fixed rate per gallon of ULSD and receive the monthly average price of Gulf Coast ULSD. Because the fixed price is determined based on market prices at the time we enter into the hedge, in times of increasing fuel prices the hedge contracts become more valuable, whereas in times of decreasing fuel prices the opposite is true. At December 31, 2021, we had no forward futures swap contracts on diesel. We had no fuel hedging contracts at December 31, 2021, and at December 31, 2020, the fair value of our fuel hedging contracts represented a $0.2 million asset.
 
Seasonality
 
Our tractor productivity decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations, and some shippers reduce their shipments after the winter holiday season. Our Expedited segment, historically has experienced a greater reduction in first quarter demand than our other operations. Revenue also can be affected by bad weather, holidays and the number of business days that occur during a given period, since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers. At the same time, operating expenses increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims, and more equipment repairs. In addition, many of our customers, particularly those in the retail industry where we have a large presence, demand additional capacity during the fourth quarter, which limits our ability to take advantage of more attractive spot market rates that generally exist during such periods. Further, despite our efforts to meet such demands, we may fail to do so, which may result in lost future business opportunities with such customers, which could have a materially adverse effect on our operations. Recently, the duration of this increased period of demand in the fourth quarter has shortened, with certain customers requiring the same volume of shipments over a more condensed timeframe, resulting in increased stress and demand on our network, people, and systems. If this trend continues, it could make satisfying our customers and maintaining the quality of our service during the fourth quarter increasingly difficult. We may also suffer from natural disasters and weather-related events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, and fires, which may increase in frequency and severity due to climate change, as well as other man-made disasters. These events may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy our assets, or adversely affect the business or financial condition of our customers, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or make our results of operations more volatile. Weather and other seasonal events could adversely affect our operating results.
