ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Francesca’s Holdings Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 2007. We are a holding company and all of our business operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Our principal executive office is located at 8760 Clay Road, Houston, Texas 77080, our telephone number is (713) 864-1358 and our fax number is (713) 426-2751. We maintain a website at www.francescas.com. We may post information that is important to our investors on our website. Information included or referred to on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not intended to form part or be incorporated by reference into this report. Except where the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, the terms “francesca’s®,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” and “our business” refer to Francesca’s Holdings Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries as a combined entity.
 
We operate on a fiscal calendar which, in a given fiscal year, consists of a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31st. The reporting periods contained in our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain 52 weeks of operations in fiscal year 2018, which ended on February 2, 2019, 53 weeks of operations in fiscal year 2017, which ended on February 3, 2018, and 52 weeks of operations in fiscal year 2016, which ended on January 28, 2017.

We aim to offer a differentiated shopping experience and quality, on-trend merchandise at a compelling value, across a wide variety of geographic markets and shopping venues.

Recent Developments
 
We have developed a turnaround plan to stabilize and then grow our business. This plan includes strategies aimed at enhancing our financial performance, which has declined primarily as a result of our continued comparable sales declines. See “Our Growth Strategy” below for additional information. In fiscal year 2018, comparable sales declined 14% and in fiscal year 2017 comparable sales declined 11%. In each case, we believe the declines were primarily the result of our inability to successfully implement merchandise planning, buying and promotional policies to leverage our strength of delivering on-trend merchandise at a compelling value, causing declines in both conversion rates and boutique traffic. Additionally, the growth in our expense structure has outpaced our revenues. As a result, our ability to generate cash from operations was adversely impacted in fiscal year 2018 and we ended the year with $20.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $10.0 million in borrowings under our Asset Based Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). Subsequent to fiscal year 2018, we borrowed an additional $5.0 million under our Asset Based Revolving Credit Facility while waiting for the receipt of an income tax refund from the IRS. As of May 2, 2019, our estimated cash and cash equivalents were approximately $13.0 million which included the receipt of $8.5 million income tax refund from the IRS we received on April 22, 2019. Additionally, the estimated cash balance as of May 2, 2019 reflects a $5.0 million payment on our Asset Based Revolving Credit Facility, bringing the outstanding balance back down to $10.0 million and our estimated additional availability to $14.6 million as of that date. We also incurred an operating loss of $33.5 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to operating income of $30.0 million in fiscal 2017. Our operating loss for fiscal year 2018 includes a non-cash asset impairment charge, a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, professional fees associated with the Company’s turnaround plan and evaluation of strategic and financial alternatives discussed below and reversal of stock-based compensation in connection with our Chief Executive Officer’s (“CEO”) resignation. See below under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Results of Operations,” for additional information.
 
In addition, as previously disclosed, in January 2019, our Board of Directors initiated a review of our strategic and financial alternatives to maximize value. We retained Rothschild & Co and other advisors to assist in the review of these alternatives. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic and financial alternatives will result in any transaction or other result that enhances value. Also as previously disclosed, we have not set a timetable for the completion of the review process, and we do not intend to comment on the process unless a specific transaction or other alternative is approved by our Board of Directors, the process is concluded, or it is otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate or required by law.
 
In addition, in February 2019, Mr. Steve Lawrence resigned from his position as our President and CEO and Mr. Michael Prendergast of Alvarez & Marsal was appointed as our Interim CEO. Also, in February 2019, our Senior Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer departed the Company. We are in the beginning stages of a formal search for a permanent CEO and either a general merchandising manager or a Chief Merchandising Officer, but are confident that we currently have an experienced interim leadership team in place to execute on our turnaround plan.

Our Philosophy
 
Our operating philosophy is grounded in the following and we believe differentiates us from our competitors:
 

· | On-trend Merchandise Delivered at a Compelling Value. Our boutiques aim to carry a broad and shallow selection of quality on-trend apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts at attractive prices that ‘surprise and delight’ our customers. Our buyers closely monitor the marketplace to identify and source proven fashion trends we believe will appeal to our core customers. We have a unique assortment as we primarily offer items under our proprietary labels. We also carry a small selection of third-party, nationally recognized brands that we use opportunistically in certain categories. We offer a broad selection of merchandise, but intentionally purchase relatively smaller quantities of individual items for each boutique. We frequently replenish our boutiques with new merchandise, keeping the shopping experience fresh and exciting for our customers. The short lead times of our vendors maximizes our speed to market, as it generally takes four to twelve weeks from the time an order is placed to the time merchandise is available on the boutique floor. These short lead times enable us to make more informed buying decisions by allowing us to react quickly to fashion trends. This approach, combined with our balanced merchandise mix of approximately 50% apparel and 50% jewelry, accessories and gifts, is designed to encourage frequent visits by our customers and mitigate the seasonal fluctuations in sales and merchandise margin.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Differentiated Shopping Experience. Each of our retail locations is designed and merchandised to feel like an upscale yet affordable boutique. Merchandise presentations, including display windows, tables and walls, are refreshed frequently to keep our boutiques new and exciting. Each boutique feels individualized and our boutique associates strive to provide a personalized and intimate guest experience by creating a high-touch service environment which increases guest engagement and enhances the shopping experience. We believe these attributes, along with our strategy of carrying a broad selection but relatively limited quantities of individual styles, create an atmosphere that appeals to our customers and differentiates us in the marketplace.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Flexible Boutique Format and Rigorous Real Estate Selection Process. Our boutique format typically works across a wide variety of shopping venues, market sizes, climates and demographics. Our boutiques are leased from third parties with initial lease terms of five to ten years and have an average size of 1,452 square feet, which is meaningfully smaller than most specialty retailers. Our flexible real estate format, coupled with the performance of our boutiques, has historically enhanced our ability to secure prominent, highly visible locations in regional malls, lifestyle centers, street locations, strip centers and outlet centers. The selection of the location of our boutiques benefits from our rigorous real estate selection process, with all boutique locations measured against specific financial and geographic criteria, including the calibration of occupancy costs against projected sales for new boutiques.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Solid and Scalable Infrastructure. We have invested in systems, controls and human resources to support our operations. In recent years, we have made significant improvements in our ecommerce and IT systems as well as the infrastructure of our buying, planning and allocation, real estate, boutique operations, and finance departments. For instance, we believe that we have developed an integrated sourcing, distribution and merchandising process that is scalable. This includes buyers who work closely with an established and diverse group of vendors to identify on-trend, quality merchandise for our boutiques, as well as delivery, distribution and merchandising processes that enable us to execute a broad and shallow merchandising approach.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy 
 
We believe we can grow our revenues and earnings by executing on our turnaround plan that includes the following strategies:
 

· | Improve Merchandise to be More On-Trend and Better Aligned with Customer Demand. We plan to increase comparable sales by having customer demand drive our merchandise assortment. In recent years, we have not successfully executed demand based, fast fashion merchandising processes. Going forward, we plan to return to merchandising policies that allow us to better react to customer demands. Additionally, we will be guided by a deliberate category hierarchy focused on three types of merchandise: fashion, seasonal and core to ensure that our merchandise offerings are balanced and relevant to our customers. We believe this merchandising strategy will improve our conversion rates as we better meet our customers’ expectations which will then lead to increased traffic.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Renewed Emphasis on Demand Based, Fast Fashion Principles in Merchandise Planning and Buying. We believe merchandise planning and buying processes that better emphasize demand based, fast fashion principles will help drive comparable sales. We believe successfully implementing these principles will enable us to invest further in merchandise that is resonating with our customers and adjust accordingly when merchandise is not resonating with our customers. We expect this will result in improved sales and a steady flow of on-trend merchandise into our boutiques and ecommerce site. Our turnaround plan includes the following strategies that will help us better implement to those principles:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o | We are updating and adding robust analytics to our planning and buying processes in order to more quickly react to fashion trends and the resonance of our merchandise with our customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We are increasing the flexibility of our planning such that a greater portion of our merchandise will be open to buy in season, enabling our style selection and inventory investments to better respond to customer demand.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We are activating a wide scale testing strategy to help evaluate promotional strategies with the goal to expand impactful wins to all boutiques.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Right Size Our Expense Structure. At the end of fiscal 2018 and in early fiscal 2019, we reduced selling, general and administrative costs by implementing targeted reductions across the entire organization, including workforce reductions in both our corporate office and field management, which we expect will provide us with approximately $15.0 million in annualized savings before costs to achieve. We plan to continue to look for further efficiencies in selling, general and administrative costs in the remainder of fiscal 2019. For example, in February 2019, we instituted a robust and detailed expense controls and review process. We believe these actions will have a direct impact on our profitability in both the short and long term.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increase Boutique Team Productivity. We believe through focused monitoring of our boutique labor and sales metrics we can better utilize our sales associates’ time without sacrificing the customer experience. For example, certain tasks that were previously performed by our associates after boutique hours will now be completed when our boutiques are open but during the windows that our data shows that the boutique traffic is lighter. Additionally, our use of an enhanced scheduling tool, that will be continuously reviewed and refined, should better align boutique payroll expense to sales levels.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Optimize Existing Real Estate Fleet. While we believe we have an opportunity to grow our boutique base in the United States based on our flexible boutique format and the financial characteristics of our boutiques, we are currently focused on optimizing our existing real estate fleet. In particular, we are focusing on optimizing the lease expense structure for our existing boutiques, with an emphasis towards calibrating occupancy costs with sales levels and negotiating with landlords for early lease terminations or rent concessions for underperforming boutiques and early lease extensions for our best performing boutiques. Additionally, we continue to regularly review our existing boutiques for opportunistic closures to increase the overall health of our fleet without incurring material write-offs associated with such closures. In fiscal 2019, we expect to open approximately four new boutiques and close at least 20 underperforming boutiques. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our History
 
In 1999, our Company was founded and we opened our first boutique in Houston, Texas. Initially, we focused on selling fashion jewelry, accessories and selected home décor. As our boutique base grew across the United States we expanded our merchandise offering to include apparel, which has become our largest category. In July 2011, we became a publicly-traded company.
Our Market
 
Our distinct boutique environment and carefully selected merchandise focused on quality, on-trend offerings at a compelling value attracts a wide demographic. Our unique merchandise combination of apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts allows us to participate in a number of large market segments. While our broad assortment appeals to women of varying ages and diverse backgrounds, from the value-conscious to the more affluent, our core guest is a fashion-conscious woman between the ages of 18 and 35. She tends to be college educated and has moderate to high disposable income. She enjoys shopping for the latest fashion and is attracted to our upscale boutique shopping environment, compelling value proposition and personalized customer service. We believe she spends a higher proportion of her income on fashion than the general population.
Our Merchandise Offering and Merchandising Strategy
 
We offer a broad and shallow selection of fashion apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts targeted to our core customer, who seeks on-trend, quality merchandise at attractive prices. We use the term broad and shallow to refer to a diverse merchandise assortment with smaller quantities of each item than most specialty retailers. In addition to our broad assortment, we deliver new merchandise to our boutiques every week offering our customer constant newness. We have a balanced assortment of merchandise categories with 50% of our fiscal year 2018 sales generated by non-apparel items.
 
Our wide range of apparel, jewelry and accessories fills the various casual and dressy fashion needs of our customers and our selection of gifts range from fun to elegant. The majority of our merchandise is sold under our proprietary labels and we also sell a select assortment of third-party, nationally recognized brands. Our ecommerce website features the same merchandise offered in our boutiques coupled with on-line exclusives. Additionally, our ecommerce inventory is now available to order in-boutique in the same transaction as in-boutique purchases or in a separate transaction. The table below shows the approximate breakdown of our fiscal year 2018 net sales by merchandise category:

-


Apparel 47% of Net Sales | Jewelry 25% of Net Sales | Accessories 16% of Net Sales | Gifts 12% of Net Sales 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dresses, Fashion Tops, Sweaters, Cardigans and Wraps, Bottoms, Outerwear and Jackets, Tees and Tanks, Intimates | Necklaces, Earrings, Bracelets, Rings | Handbags, Clutches, Wallets, Shoes, Belts, Hats, Scarves, Sunglasses, Watches, Beauty, Hair Accessories | Fragrance, Candles, Bath and Body, Home Accessories, Books, Wall Art, Nail Polish, Miscellaneous Items

 
As discussed above, we believe we can improve our conversion and traffic rates and our flow of on-trend merchandise by implementing our strategies of customer demand driving our merchandise assortment and our renewed emphasis on demand based, fast fashion principles in merchandise planning and buying.
 
Our buying team is responsible for selecting and sourcing our merchandise. Each merchandise category has a set of dedicated buyers. Our planning and allocation team assists in managing inventory levels and allocating items to boutiques. Both the buying and planning and allocation teams are currently reporting to an interim General Merchandise Manager with a tenured and broad range of retail experience. The teams hold weekly meetings to review merchandise performance and identify new fashion trends. Our buyers also make regular trips to important industry markets and trade shows. We have access to the expertise of hundreds of designers employed by our large vendor base who provide us with a large selection of new styles for review. Our buyers collaborate with vendors to place special orders and to modify presented styles based on current fashion trends and their in-depth knowledge of our customers’ preferences, which means most of our merchandise is typically unique to francesca’s. Before placing an order, every item is evaluated for style, quality, fit, value and profitability to ensure it meets standards consistent with the francesca’s ® brand. Every item is also evaluated to confirm that it fits within our category hierarchy comprised of fashion, seasonal or core categories. In order to clear slow moving inventory, in addition to normal promotional and markdown activities, we regularly mark certain merchandise out-of-stock and dispose of such inventory at a pace suitable for our merchandising strategy.
 
Our Sourcing Strategy
 
Our renewed emphasis on a demand based, fast fashion model in merchandise planning and buying, combined with the short production lead times of our vendors, maximizes our speed to market. We primarily use vendors based in the United States that source from both domestic and overseas markets and it generally takes four to twelve weeks from the time an order is placed to the time merchandise is available on the boutique floor. These short lead times enable us to make more informed buying decisions in terms of customers’ merchandise expectations, and to quickly react to changing fashion trends. This also supports our merchandise strategy of offering a broad and shallow assortment that is consistently refreshed.
 
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We have relationships with a diverse base of more than 500 vendors and transact business on a purchase-order-by-purchase order basis. In fiscal year 2018, we sourced approximately 93% of our merchandise from 200 vendors while our top 10 vendors sourced approximately 28% of our merchandise, with no single vendor accounting for more than 5% of our purchases. We believe that the loss of any single current vendor would not result in a material disruption to our business.
 
We do not enter into exclusive contracts with our vendors and we continue to optimize our vendor network. This provides us with access to an even more extensive variety of merchandise from a greater number of vendors at competitive prices. We believe our vendors view us as an important customer given our market position. Our vendors utilize a network of domestic and overseas factories, providing them access to significant capacity.
 
Each of our vendors is required to adhere to our vendor standards, which are designed to ensure that our vendors conduct their business in a legal, ethical and responsible manner. This also includes the requirement that all of our vendors comply with the applicable laws and regulations of the United States, those of the respective country of manufacture or exportation and all state and local laws and regulations. To date, we have not experienced any significant impact from the trading polices of the United States or its trading partners.

Our Sales Channels
 
We conduct business through our boutiques and our ecommerce website, www.francescas.com. We do not incorporate the information contained on, or accessible through, our investor relations website into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and it should not be considered a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Boutiques
 
As of February 2, 2019, we operated 727 boutiques under the name francesca’s® in 47 states throughout the United States and the District of Columbia. Our long-term strategy depends on our ability to successfully operate existing and new boutiques in a timely and cost-effective manner. Under the turnaround plan, our current priority is to implement the strategies discussed above under “Our Growth Strategy” to enhance comparable sales and profitability and, as such, we are only planning to open approximately four new boutiques in fiscal year 2019 and plan to close at least 20 underperforming boutiques as we continue to optimize our existing boutique fleet. We plan to resume boutique openings in the future as appropriate once the desired results of our turnaround plan are achieved. The following list shows the number of boutiques operated by state as of February 2, 2019.

Boutique Design and Environment
 
The differentiated shopping experience offered through our boutiques is central to the francesca’s® brand. Our boutiques are designed and merchandised to deliver a warm and inviting atmosphere that creates a boutique shopping experience. We also aim to provide a personalized in-boutique guest experience by creating a high-touch service environment with a focus on engaging, connecting and inspiring our customers. Although we strive to maintain a relatively consistent look and feel in all of our boutiques, the intricacies of each boutique’s physical properties, geographic market and shopping venue make each feel different and in tune with its local clientele.
 
Our boutiques typically range in size from 1,000 to 2,000 square feet, with an average size of 1,452 square feet as of February 2, 2019. Our locations typically have a boutique front that is at least 25 feet wide, which we adorn with visually appealing architectural lighting, signage and display window presentations. Inside, we use a variety of color palettes and soft lighting. Each boutique’s merchandise presentation, including display windows, tables and walls, is refreshed frequently to keep our shopping experience new and exciting. We believe by constantly changing our visual merchandising and presentation, we give our customers a reason to shop our boutiques frequently, building customer loyalty. Our boutique managers also share best-practices with each other. We believe these grass-root interactions improve the sense of community among our boutique managers and enhance the shopping experience for our customers.

Staffing in our boutiques consists of a boutique manager, an assistant manager and part-time associates. Our compensation structure includes a bonus component payable upon the achievement of certain financial goals. We endeavor to hire boutique personnel that are friendly and customer-service driven individuals. In addition to training programs for visual merchandising, customer service and operations, boutique managers benefit from ongoing field-level support and training updates as well as guides and manuals. As discussed above under “Our Growth Strategy,” a core component of our growth strategy is to increase the productivity of our in-boutique teams.
 
Boutique Openings, Closures and Remodels
 
During fiscal year 2017, we opened 60 boutiques with an average size of approximately 1,597 square feet. These boutiques generated average sales of approximately $578,000 in the first year and paid back our net investment, on average, in approximately three and a half years. Our average pre-tax net investment consisted of $236,000 in average boutique build-out costs (net of $57,000 average tenant allowance) and $58,000 in average inventory. The payback period for boutiques opened in fiscal year 2017 was significantly longer compared to the payback period for boutiques opened in prior years primarily due to a decrease in overall boutique profitability as well as increasing boutique build-out costs, partly as a result of opening more boutiques in outlet centers, which are generally larger in size compared to boutiques in other venues.
 
The table below indicates certain historical information regarding our boutiques as of the end of each of the periods indicated below:

(3) | Net sales per average square foot is calculated by dividing net sales for the period by the average total square feet during the period. For purposes of providing net sales per square- foot measure, we use average square feet during the period as opposed to total gross square feet at the end of the period. Average square feet is calculated as (a) the sum of total gross square feet at the beginning of the period and total gross square feet at the end of each fiscal quarter within the period, divided by (b) the number of fiscal quarters within the period plus one (which, for a fiscal year, is five). There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate sales per square foot or similarly titled measures. As a result, average square feet and net sales per average square foot for the period may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers.

Our flexible boutique format has enabled us to successfully open boutiques across a variety of shopping venues, market sizes, climates and demographics. Our real estate committee has consistently utilized a disciplined approach to site selection, which analyzes the prospective shopping venue for factors such as overall shopping venue productivity, competitive environment and specific sales of other retailers deemed most relevant as well as the configuration of available space for potential new boutique locations. When selecting a location for a new boutique, we seek prominent locations in high-traffic areas of the shopping venue and in close proximity to other retailers targeting similar customers. We also evaluate each new boutique location based on projected sales and determine whether the capital investment and estimated boutique four-wall contribution satisfies our targeted return threshold, occupancy costs, and boutique contribution. We believe these attributes have provided us, and will continue to provide us, with a wide scope of real estate opportunities and enhances our ability to profitably expand our boutique base. Our current priority is to implement the strategies of our turnaround plan discussed above under “Our Growth Strategy” to enhance comparable sales and profitability and, as such, we are only planning to open approximately four new boutiques in fiscal year 2019 and plan to close at least 20 underperforming boutiques as we continue to optimize our existing boutique fleet. We plan to resume boutique openings in the future as appropriate when the desired results are achieved under our turnaround plan.
 
We continuously review the overall economic performance of our boutiques. As part of our economic review process, we evaluate a variety of factors such as expected future revenue and contribution margin, applicable market conditions, our co-tenancy requirements, unamortized portion of leasehold improvements, our ability to terminate the underlying lease obligation and related cost of any such early termination. As a result of such review, we closed 26 underperforming boutiques during fiscal year 2018, with the bulk of such closures occurring in January 2019, and we plan to close at least 20 underperforming boutiques in fiscal year 2019. For fiscal year 2019, we are focused on optimizing our existing real estate fleet by focusing on optimizing the lease expense structure for our existing boutiques, with an emphasis towards calibrating occupancy costs and sales levels, negotiating with landlords for early lease terminations or rent concessions for underperforming boutiques and early extensions for our best performing boutiques, as appropriate.

In fiscal year 2018, we started a boutique remodel program where we refreshed 81 high-volume existing boutiques. We view this refresh program as an important investment to continually enhance the customer shopping experience. We believe the 2018 refreshes will help improve our comparable sales during fiscal year 2019. While we have decided to put a pause on this program in fiscal year 2019 due to the recent challenges in our business, we currently intend to reinitiate this program in fiscal year 2020.
 
Ecommerce
 
Our ecommerce operations consists of our www.francescas.com website. Through our website, our customers are able to purchase individual items, shop the latest jewelry, gift or fashion merchandise and special promotions, create a wish list, sign up for our customer email list, connect and follow us on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest, as well as obtain current information on our boutique locations. This channel enables us to further build our brand, address the growing preference for online shopping and reach customers in all areas where we currently do not have a boutique. We recognize the growing preference for online shopping and we plan to make investments in our website and supporting functions that will further enhance our customers’ shopping experience as well as establish the framework for our long-term ecommerce strategies. During fiscal 2018, we invested in a warehouse management system to support our ecommerce operations. During fiscal year 2019, we plan to focus on “Our Growth Strategy” as described above and we do not plan to make any significant new investments to our ecommerce operations. We believe there is significant potential to expand this channel over time with our current infrastructure.

We have made significant investments in our technology systems and enabled certain omni channel capabilities, including “buy-online and ship-to-boutique” and “buy-in-boutique and ship-to-home,” which offer a consistent and seamless shopping experience both in-boutique or online. We believe that the line between our boutiques and ecommerce channels are disappearing as customers increasingly interact with us both in-boutique and online. We are focused on leveraging the best of both channels to create an exceptional and seamless omni channel shopping experience for our customers.
Marketing and Advertising
 
We have historically focused on organic, viral and in-boutique marketing to increase customer loyalty and build our brand image. By locating our boutiques in prominent, high-traffic locations and our limited use of traditional radio and print advertising, we encourage people to ‘discover’ francesca’s ®. We believe that many of our customers develop a personal connection with our boutiques and become our ambassadors in the local community by spreading the word about francesca’s®. Our boutique managers are passionate about francesca’s ® and contribute to our marketing effort by participating in shopping center or community sponsored marketing events. We also use email communications, our website and, increasingly, social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest and fashion related blogs to achieve our marketing goals. We plan to continue to focus our investments in the appropriate marketing programs to build customer loyalty. In 2018, we launched a nationwide customer loyalty program, franRewards™, where members may receive free gifts, discounts as well as early access to certain promotions. Our loyalty program is aimed at driving traffic into our boutiques, better understand our customers’ purchasing pattern as well as support various strategic initiatives.
Distribution
 
We distribute most of our merchandise from our distribution center (located within our corporate headquarters) in Houston, Texas. Our current facility occupies approximately 218,000 square feet, consisting of approximately 165,000 square feet of warehouse and distribution space, which services our boutiques and ecommerce, and approximately 53,000 square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters. Our merchandise is generally received, inspected, managed, stored and distributed through our distribution warehouse. The majority of our merchandise is pre-ticketed and pre-sorted by our vendors which allows us to efficiently ship from our distribution center directly to our boutiques, thereby reducing labor costs. Due to the relatively small size of our boutiques, we ship smaller packages of fresh merchandise weekly. Hence, we are able to utilize third party shipping vendors to effectively distribute merchandise on a continuous basis, ensuring successful execution of our broad and shallow merchandising strategy. We believe that our current facilities will be sufficient to support our growth plans for several years.
Management Information Systems
 
Our management information technology systems provide support and timely information to our management team. We believe our current systems provide us with operational efficiencies, scalability, management control and timely reporting that allows us to identify and respond to operating trends in our business. We use a combination of customized and industry-standard software systems to support boutique point-of-sale, merchandise planning and buying, ecommerce, inventory management, financial reporting and administrative functions.

We recently deployed new technologies to enhance our omni-channel and customer engagement capabilities as part of our long-term strategic plan. In fiscal year 2017, we completed our legacy point-of-sale system replacement and the implementation of a new customer relationship management system. In October 2018, we completed the implementation of a new warehouse management system for ecommerce. These new systems will enhance our visibility into our customers’ preferences, merchandise products and supply chain which we expect will result in improved customer service, improved operational efficiency, enhanced management analytics and increased inventory synergies between our ecommerce and our boutique channels.
 
We will remain diligent in our efforts to maintain the functionality and performance of our existing enterprise applications and infrastructure to support the Company’s turnaround and growth plans.
 
Competition
 
The women’s apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts market is large, fragmented and highly competitive. Our largest competitors include national and regional department stores, value retailers, specialty retailers, mass merchants and internet-based retailers. Due to the breadth of our merchandise, it is difficult to identify companies that compete with us in every product category. We generally compete with individual, often owner-operated specialty shops in each of the markets that we operate as well as broadly merchandised department stores and certain specialty stores. We also face intense competition from the ecommerce platforms of our brick and mortar competitors, as well as internet-based retailers due to the continuing shift in customer demand away from brick and mortar to ecommerce. We may also face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
 
The principal basis upon which we compete is by offering a differentiated shopping experience through quality, on-trend merchandise at attractive prices in a warm and inviting boutique environment with personalized customer service. Our manageable boutique size and flexible but disciplined real estate strategy provide us with a competitive advantage that is not easily replicated by our major competitors. Our success also depends in substantial part on our ability to respond quickly to fashion trends so that we can meet the changing demands of our customers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have registered our trademark francesca’s® with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We own domain names, including www.francescas.com, and we own unregistered copyright rights in our website content. We believe our trademarks have value, and we diligently protect them against infringement. For instance, we have filed applications to register our trademark internationally. We will also continue to file new applications as appropriate to protect our intellectual property rights.
Regulation and Legislation
 
We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising and promotions, privacy laws, product and other safety regulations, consumer protection regulations, environmental requirements and other laws that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of boutiques and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws in all material respects.
Insurance
 
We use insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, cyber security and employee-related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by the employees. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis and believe we maintain adequate levels of coverage.
Our Employees
 
As of February 2, 2019, we had 5,955 total employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have had no labor-related work stoppages as of February 2, 2019. Our relationship with our employees is one of the keys to our success and we believe that relationship is satisfactory.
Seasonality
 
Our wide-range of merchandise and our strategy of carrying a broad selection but limited quantities of each item reduce our overall seasonality relative to other specialty retailers. Nevertheless, our business is seasonal in nature and demand is generally the highest in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season and lowest in the first fiscal quarter. As a result of this seasonality and generally because of variation in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales and working capital requirements during the year. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Seasonality” for more information.
