 Item 1.  Business
 The Company is a Canadian corporation that was formed in March 1994 as a result of an amalgamation between WGIM Acquisition Corp. and the former IMAX Corporation (“Predecessor IMAX”). Predecessor IMAX was incorporated in 1967.
 As of December 31, 2021, the Company indirectly owns 71.11% of IMAX China Holding, Inc. (“IMAX China”), whose shares trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. IMAX China is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company.
 GENERAL
 IMAX is a premier global technology platform for entertainment and events. Through its proprietary software, theater architecture, patented intellectual property, and specialized equipment, IMAX offers a unique end-to-end solution to create superior, immersive content experiences for which the IMAX® brand is globally renowned. Top filmmakers, movie studios, artists, and creators utilize the cutting-edge visual and sound technology of IMAX to connect with audiences in innovative ways. As a result, IMAX is among the most important and successful global distribution platforms for domestic and international tentpole films and, increasingly, exclusive experiences ranging from live performances to interactive events with leading artists and creators.
 The Company leverages its proprietary technology and engineering in all aspects of its business, which principally consists of the digital remastering of films and other content into the IMAX format (“IMAX DMR”®) and the sale or lease of premium IMAX theater systems (“IMAX Theater Systems”). 
 IMAX Theater Systems are based on proprietary and patented image, audio and other technology developed over the course of the Company’s history since its founding in 1968. The customers for IMAX Theater Systems are principally theater exhibitors that operate commercial multiplex theaters, and, to a much lesser extent, museums, science centers and destination entertainment sites. The Company generally does not own the theaters in the IMAX network, and is not an exhibitor, but instead sells or leases the IMAX Theater System to the exhibitor along with a license to use its trademarks.
 As of December 31, 2021, there were 1,683 IMAX Theater Systems operating in 87 countries and territories, including 1,599 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations, and 72 institutional locations. This compares to 1,650 IMAX Theater Systems operating in 84 countries and territories as of December 31, 2020 including 1,562 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations, and 76 institutional locations. (See the table below under “Marketing and Customers” for additional information on the composition of the IMAX network.)
 The IMAX Theater System provides the Company’s exhibitor customers with a combination of the following benefits:
  
• | the ability to exhibit content that has undergone the IMAX DMR conversion process, which results in higher image and sound fidelity than conventional cinema experiences;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advanced, high-resolution projectors with specialized equipment and automated theater control systems, which generate significantly more contrast and brightness than conventional theater systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | large screens and proprietary theater geometry, which result in a substantially larger field of view so that the screen extends to the edge of a viewer’s peripheral vision and creates more realistic images;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advanced sound system components, which deliver more expansive sound imagery and pinpointed origination of sound to any specific spot in an IMAX theater;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | specialized theater acoustics, which result in a four-fold reduction in background noise; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a license to the globally recognized IMAX brand.
--+-------------------------------------------------

In addition, certain movies shown in IMAX theaters are filmed using proprietary IMAX film cameras or IMAX certified digital cameras, which offer filmmakers customized guidance and a workflow process to provide further enhanced and differentiated image quality and an IMAX-exclusive film aspect ratio that delivers up to 26% more image onto a standard IMAX movie screen. In select IMAX theaters worldwide, movies filmed with IMAX cameras have an IMAX-exclusive 1.43 film aspect ratio, with up to 67% more image.
 Together, these components cause audiences in IMAX theaters to feel as if they are a part of the on-screen action, creating a more intense, immersive, and exciting experience than a traditional theater.
 As a result of the engineering and scientific achievements that are a hallmark of The IMAX Experience®, the Company’s exhibitor customers typically charge a premium for IMAX films over films exhibited in their other auditoriums. The premium pricing, combined with the higher attendance levels associated with IMAX films, generates incremental box office for the Company’s exhibitor customers and for the movie studios releasing their films to the IMAX network. The incremental box office generated by IMAX films has helped establish IMAX as a key premium distribution and marketing platform for Hollywood blockbuster films and foreign local language movie studios. 
 As a premier global technology platform for entertainment and events, the Company strives to remain at the forefront of advancements in cinema technology. The Company offers a suite of IMAX Laser Theater Systems, which deliver increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast and the widest range of colors available to filmmakers today. The Company further believes that its suite of IMAX Laser Theater Systems are helping facilitate the next major renewal and upgrade cycle for the global IMAX network.
 In addition, the Company continues to evolve its platform to bring new, innovative events and experiences to audiences worldwide. The Company has a connected IMAX theater footprint capable of delivering live, interactive content with low latency and superior sight and sound. As of December 31, 2021, 68 theaters in the IMAX network were configured to enable the streaming of live events with additional theaters expected to go-live throughout 2022.
 IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC
 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and continuously evolving, resulting in significant disruption to the Company’s business and the global economy. At various points during the pandemic, authorities around the world imposed measures intended to control the spread of COVID-19, including stay-at-home orders and restrictions on large public gatherings, which caused movie theaters in countries around the world to temporarily close, including the IMAX theaters in those countries. As a result of these theater closures, movie studios postponed the theatrical release of most films originally scheduled for release in 2020 and early 2021, including many of the films scheduled to be shown in IMAX theaters, while several other films were released directly or concurrently to streaming platforms. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, stay-at-home orders and capacity restrictions were lifted in many key markets and movie theaters throughout the IMAX network gradually reopened. However, following the emergence of the Omicron variant and the rise of COVID-19 cases in late 2021 and early 2022, some governments reinstituted capacity restrictions and safety protocols on large public gatherings, leading to the temporary closure of theaters or the imposition of capacity restrictions in certain markets. As of December 31, 2021, 95% of the theaters in the global IMAX commercial multiplex network were open at various capacities. For additional information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic” and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. 
 (See “Risk Factors – The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods” in Part I, Item 1A, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic” and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)
 IMAX NETWORK
 The Company believes the IMAX network is one of the most extensive premium networks in the world with 1,683 IMAX Theater Systems operating in 87 countries and territories, including 1,599 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations and 72 institutional locations as of December 31, 2021. (See the table below under “IMAX Network and Backlog” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional information on the composition of the IMAX network.)

The Company currently believes that over time its commercial multiplex network could grow to approximately 3,318 IMAX theaters worldwide from the 1,599 operating as of December 31, 2021. The Company believes that the majority of its future growth will come from international markets. As of December 31, 2021, 74% of IMAX Theater Systems in operation were located within international markets (defined as all countries other than the United States and Canada), compared to 73% as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, the box office results and revenues derived from international markets continue to exceed those derived from the United States and Canada. Risks associated with the Company’s international business are outlined in “Risk Factors – The Company conducts business internationally, which exposes it to uncertainties and risks that could negatively affect its operations, sales and future growth prospects” in Part I, Item 1A.
 Greater China is the Company’s largest market, measured by revenues, with approximately 44% and 38% of consolidated revenues generated from its Greater China operations in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 783 theaters operating in Greater China and an additional 215 theaters in backlog. The Company’s backlog in Greater China represents 44% of its total current backlog, including upgrades in system type. The Company’s largest single international partnership is in China with Wanda Film (“Wanda”). As of December 31, 2021, through the Company’s partnership with Wanda, there are 369 IMAX Theater Systems operational in Greater China, of which 355 are under the parties’ joint revenue sharing arrangement. 
 (See “Risk Factors – The Company faces risks in connection with its significant presence in China and the continued expansion of its business there”, “Risk Factors – General political, social and economic conditions can affect the Company’s business by reducing both revenues generated from existing IMAX Theater Systems and the demand for new IMAX Theater Systems”, and “Risk Factors – The Company may not convert all of its backlog into revenue and cash flows” in Part I, Item 1A.) 
 (See “Risk Factors – The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods” in Part I, Item 1A.)

IMAX DMR
 IMAX DMR is a proprietary technology that digitally remasters films into IMAX formats. IMAX DMR digitally enhances the image resolution of films for projection on IMAX screens while maintaining or enhancing the visual clarity and sound quality to levels for which The IMAX Experience is known. In addition, the original soundtrack of a film to be exhibited in IMAX theaters is remastered for IMAX digital sound systems. Unlike the soundtracks played in conventional theaters, IMAX remastered soundtracks are uncompressed and full fidelity. IMAX sound systems use proprietary loudspeaker systems and proprietary surround sound configurations that ensure every theater seat is in an optimal listening position.
 The IMAX DMR process involves: 
 
 
• | in certain instances, scanning, at the highest possible resolution, each individual frame of the movie and converting it into a digital image;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | optimizing the image using proprietary image enhancement tools;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhancing the digital image using techniques such as sharpening, color correction, grain and noise removal and the elimination of unsteadiness and removal of unwanted artifacts;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recording the enhanced digital image into an IMAX digital cinema package (“DCP”) format or onto IMAX 15/70-format film; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | specially remastering the soundtrack to take full advantage of the unique sound system of IMAX Theater Systems.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 IMAX films also benefit from enhancements made by individual filmmakers exclusively for the IMAX release of the film. Collectively, the Company refers to these enhancements as “IMAX DNA”. Filmmakers and movie studios have sought IMAX-specific enhancements in recent years to generate interest in and excitement for their films. Such enhancements include shooting films with IMAX cameras to increase the audience’s immersion in the film and to take advantage of the unique dimensions of the IMAX screen by projecting the film in a larger aspect ratio that delivers up to 26% more image onto a standard IMAX movie screen. In select IMAX theaters worldwide, movies filmed with IMAX cameras have an IMAX-exclusive 1.43 film aspect ratio, with up to 67% more image. 
 In 2021, 63 IMAX films were released to the Company’s global theater network, including films such as Spider-Man: No Way Home, No Time to Die, Dune, F9, The Battle at Lake Changjin, Detective Chinatown 3, Godzilla vs. Kong, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, The Eternals, and Black Widow. The films released in 2021 include 10 with IMAX DNA and 32 local language films released in China (21), Japan (9), Russia (1) and South Korea (1). In 2020, 31 IMAX films were released to the Company’s global theater network, including five with IMAX DNA, and 17 local language films released in China (10), Russia (3), Japan (3), and South Korea (1). In 2019, 60 IMAX films were released to the Company’s global theater network, including six with IMAX DNA, and 18 local language films released in China (14), Japan (1), South Korea (1), India (1) and Russia (1).
 Management believes that growth in international box office remains an important driver of growth for the Company. To support continued growth in international markets, the Company has sought to bolster its international film strategy, supplementing its slate of Hollywood films with appealing local language IMAX films released in select markets, particularly in China. The Company expects to announce additional local language IMAX films to be released to its global theater network in 2022.

 The Company remains in active negotiations with all major Hollywood studios for additional films to fill out its short and long-term film slate for the IMAX network.
 IMAX Theater Systems
 The Company’s primary products are its various digital projection systems, which are either sold or leased to exhibitor customers along with a license for the use of the globally recognized IMAX brand. The Company’s digital projection systems include a projector that offers superior image quality and stability and a digital theater control system; a digital audio system delivering up to 12,000 watts of sound; a screen with a proprietary coating technology, and, in certain situations, 3D glasses cleaning equipment. IMAX’s digital projection systems also operate without the need for analog film prints. The Company’s digital projection systems provide a premium and differentiated experience to moviegoers that is consistent with what they have come to expect from the IMAX brand, while providing exhibitor customers with the compelling economics and flexibility that digital technology affords. 
 As part of the arrangement to sell or lease an IMAX Theater System, the Company provides extensive advice on theater planning and design, and supervision of installation services. The terms of each sale or lease arrangement vary according to the configuration of the IMAX Theater System, as well as the cinema and film distribution markets relevant to the geographic location of the customer.
 Revenue from the sale or lease of an IMAX Theater System may be recognized at a different time from when cash is collected from the exhibitor customer. (See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 and Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion on the Company’s revenue recognition policies.)

The following table presents the number of IMAX Theater Systems that are open and in backlog, by configuration, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:

IMAX Laser Theater Systems 
 In 2014, the Company introduced its first laser-based digital projection system. Since then, the Company has continued research and development aimed at creating more affordable laser-based solutions with various screen sizes for its commercial multiplex customers. Beginning in late-2021, the Company began offering an additional laser-based theater system product to provide a broader array of customers with an opportunity to replace and upgrade IMAX Xenon Theater Systems. The Company believes that IMAX Laser Theater Systems present greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, consume less power and last longer than other digital projection technologies, and are capable of illuminating the largest screens in the IMAX network.
IMAX Xenon Theater Systems
 In 2008, the Company introduced its digital IMAX Xenon Theater System. Prior to 2008, all of the IMAX Theater Systems offered by the Company were film-based and required analog film prints. The Company believes that IMAX Xenon Theater Systems deliver higher quality imagery when compared with IMAX Film Theater Systems.
 IMAX Film Theater Systems 
 IMAX Film Theater Systems include various configurations, including 2D and 3D systems, and screen sizes. Following the introduction of the digital IMAX Xenon Theater System in 2008, the number of IMAX Film Theater Systems in the IMAX network has decreased significantly.
 The following table provides information about the Company’s theater system backlog as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:
  
 | December 31, 2021 | | | December 31, 2020 |

----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The consideration owed under joint revenue sharing arrangements, which are accounted for as leases, is typically contingent on the box office receipts earned by the exhibitor. Accordingly, such arrangements do not usually have a dollar value in backlog; however, certain joint revenue sharing arrangements provide for contracted upfront payments and therefore carry a backlog value based on those payments.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The number of IMAX Theater Systems in backlog reflects the minimum number of commitments under signed contracts. The dollar value fluctuates depending on the number of new arrangements signed from year-to-year, which adds to backlog, and the installation and acceptance of IMAX Theater Systems and the settlement of contracts, both of which reduce backlog. The dollar value of backlog typically represents the fixed contracted revenue under signed IMAX Theater System sale and lease agreements that the Company expects to recognize as revenue upon installation and acceptance of the associated system, as well as an estimate of variable consideration in sales arrangements. The value of backlog does not include amounts allocated to maintenance and extended warranty revenues or revenue from theaters in which the Company has an equity interest, operating leases, and long-term conditional theater commitments. The Company believes that the contractual obligations for IMAX Theater System installations that are listed in backlog are valid and binding commitments. 
 From time to time, in the normal course of its business, the Company will have customers who are unable to proceed with an IMAX Theater System installation for a variety of reasons, including the inability to obtain certain consents, approvals or financing. Once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation, the agreement with the customer is terminated or amended. If the agreement is terminated, once the Company and the customer are released from all their future obligations under the agreement, all or a portion of the initial rents or fees that the customer previously made to the Company are recognized as revenue.
 Certain of the Company’s contracts contain options for the customer to elect to upgrade system type during the term or to alter the contract structure (for example, from a joint revenue sharing arrangement to a sale) after signing, but before installation. Current backlog information reflects all known elections.
 IMAX Maintenance
 IMAX Theater System arrangements also include a requirement for the Company to provide maintenance services over the life of the arrangement in exchange for an extended warranty and annual maintenance fee paid by the theater owner or operator. Under these arrangements, the Company provides preventative and emergency maintenance services to ensure that each presentation is up to the highest IMAX quality standard. Annual maintenance fees are paid throughout the duration of the term of the theater agreements. (See “Maintenance and Extended Warranty Services” below.)
 Film Distribution and Post-Production
 Through its Film Distribution segment, the Company distributes large-format documentary films, primarily to institutional theaters. The Company receives as its distribution fee either a fixed amount or a fixed percentage of the theater box office receipts and following the recoupment of its costs, is typically entitled to receive an additional percentage of gross revenues as participation revenues.
 The ownership rights to the films distributed by the Company may be held by the film’s sponsors, third-party film investors and/or the Company. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has distribution rights with respect to 53 films, which cover subjects such as space, wildlife, music, sports, history, and natural wonders.
 In addition, the Company continues to evolve its platform to bring new, innovative events and experiences to audiences worldwide. The Company has a connected IMAX theater footprint capable of delivering live, interactive content with low latency and superior sight and sound. As of December 31, 2021, 68 theaters in the IMAX network were configured to enable the streaming of live events with additional theaters expected to go-live throughout 2022.
 In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company distributed a Kanye West and Drake concert to 35 IMAX theaters across the United States and Canada through a partnership with Amazon Music. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company also held special screenings of Joel Coen’s The Tragedy of Macbeth, including a live Q&A with Mr. Coen and actress Frances McDormand streamed from the IMAX theater in Lincoln Square, New York, and West Side Story, featuring a live Q&A with director Steven Spielberg and his cast, which was streamed from the IMAX theater of Century City, California. Also, in the first quarter of 2022, the Company partnered with Disney to hold a special screening of The Beatles: Get Back – The Rooftop Concert, featuring a live Q&A with director and producer Peter Jackson streaming to 68 IMAX theaters worldwide.
 The Company continues to believe that the IMAX network serves as a valuable platform to launch and distribute original content.
 Through its Film Post-Production segment, the Company provides film post-production and quality control services for large-format films, whether produced by IMAX or third parties, and digital post-production services.

New Business Initiatives
 The New Business Initiatives segment includes activities related to the expansion of the IMAX brand across new lines of business and initiatives, which seek to leverage the Company’s proprietary, innovative technologies, its leadership position in the entertainment technology space, its unique relationship with content creators, and its brand.
 In September 2018, the Company launched IMAX EnhancedTM, a new initiative to bring The IMAX Experience into the home, in partnership with audio leader DTS (an Xperi subsidiary). IMAX Enhanced provides end-to-end premium technology across streaming content and best-in-class entertainment devices, offering consumers high-fidelity playback of image and sound in the home and beyond, including the following features:
  
• | IMAX’s expanded aspect ratio, which is available on select titles and streaming platforms, including Disney+ and features the full scale and scope of The IMAX Experience as the filmmakers intended;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IMAX’s proprietary remastering technology, which produces a more vivid, higher-fidelity 4K HDR images on today’s best televisions; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IMAX signature sound, which is specially recreated and calibrated for the home by DTS to unlock more immersive audio.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To be certified as IMAX Enhanced, leading consumer electronics manufacturers spanning 4K/8K televisions, projectors, A/V receivers, loudspeakers, soundbars and smartphones must meet a carefully prescribed set of audiovisual performance standards, set by a certification committee of IMAX and DTS engineers, along with some of Hollywood’s leading technical specialists.
 At present, certified global device partners include Sony Electronics, Hisense, TCL, Phillips, Xiaomi, Sound United and Honor, among others. More than 150 IMAX Enhanced titles are now available across six of the biggest streaming platforms worldwide, including Disney+, Sony Bravia CORE, Tencent Video, iQiyi, Tsutaya TV and Rakuten TV. 
 The Company’s collaboration with Disney, which was announced in November 2021, allows fans to stream 14 Marvel titles in IMAX’s Expanded Aspect Ratio at home on Disney+. The 14 titles available on Disney+ include Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings and Eternals, as well as Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, Ant-Man and The Wasp, Captain Marvel, Avengers: Endgame, and Black Widow (content availability varies by region). The launch of IMAX Enhanced on Disney+ served as a focal point of Disney’s “Disney+ Day” two-year anniversary event, earning significant positive media coverage and providing strong brand exposure for IMAX by expanding the Company’s in-home entertainment footprint to more than 80 million subscribers.
 IMAX Enhanced and the collaboration with Disney is part of the Company’s next evolutionary step to grow beyond Hollywood blockbusters and extend the IMAX brand and technology further into the streaming environment.
 Other
 The Company derives a small portion of its revenues from other sources including one owned and operated IMAX theater in Sacramento, California; a commercial arrangement with one theater resulting in the sharing of profits and losses; the provision of management services to three other theaters; renting its proprietary 2D and 3D large-format film and digital cameras to third-party production companies; and also offering production advice and technical assistance to both documentary and Hollywood filmmakers.
MARKETING AND CUSTOMERS 
 The Company markets IMAX Theater Systems through a direct sales force and marketing staff located in offices in Canada, the United States, Greater China, Europe, and Asia. In addition, the Company has agreements with consultants, business brokers and real estate professionals to locate potential customers and theater sites for the Company on a commission basis. 
 Commercial multiplex theaters are the largest part of the IMAX network, comprising 1,599 IMAX theaters, or 95%, of the 1,683 IMAX theaters in the IMAX network as of December 31, 2021. The Company’s institutional customers include science and natural history museums, zoos, aquaria, and other educational and cultural centers. The Company also sells or leases IMAX Theater Systems to commercial destinations such as theme parks, private home theaters, tourist destination sites, fairs and expositions. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 74% of all open IMAX theaters were in locations outside of the United States and Canada.

 INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 Competition
 The out-of-home entertainment industry is very competitive, and the Company faces a number of competitive challenges. For instance, exhibitors and entertainment technology companies have introduced their own branded, large-screen 3D auditoriums or other proprietary theater systems, some of which include laser-based projectors, and in many cases, have marketed those auditoriums or theater systems as having similar quality or attributes to an IMAX Theater System. The Company believes that all of these alternative formats deliver images and experiences that are inferior to The IMAX Experience.
 The Company may continue to face competition in the future from companies in the entertainment industry with new technologies and/or substantially greater capital resources to develop and support them. The Company also faces in-home competition from a number of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as subscription streaming services, transactional video-on-demand (both rentals and sales), advertiser-supported video-on-demand, pay-per-view, internet, and broadcast and cable television. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when theaters were closed in many global markets, certain movie studios released several high-profile films directly or concurrently to streaming platforms rather than exclusively to theaters within the traditional theatrical release window. While there can be no assurances whether or when this practice will end once the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic fully recede, several Hollywood studios have recently reiterated their commitment to maintaining exclusive theatrical release windows. The Company further competes for the public’s leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including gaming, sporting events, concerts, live theater, social media and restaurants.
 12

The Company believes that its competitive strengths include the value of the IMAX brand name, the premium IMAX consumer experience, the design, quality and historic reliability rate of IMAX Theater Systems (including the quality of the sound system components included with an IMAX Theater System), the return on investment of an IMAX Theater System for exhibitors, the number and quality of IMAX films that it distributes, the relationships the Company maintains with prominent Hollywood and international filmmakers and other content creators (a number of whom desire to film their movies and events with IMAX cameras), the availability of Hollywood and international event films to IMAX theaters through IMAX DMR technology, the availability of unique and innovative events and experiences such as distributed concerts, special theatrical screenings, and live Q&A sessions with top content creators, consumer loyalty and the level of the Company’s service and maintenance and extended warranty efforts. The Company believes that its laser-based projection systems further increase the technological superiority of the consumer experience it delivers. As a result, the Company believes that virtually all of the best performing premium theaters in the world are IMAX theaters.
 Exhibitor Consolidation
 The Company’s primary customers are commercial multiplex exhibitors. The commercial exhibition industry has undergone significant consolidation, including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.’s (“AMC”) acquisition of Carmike Cinemas and Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group (“Odeon”), which includes Nordic Cinema Group (“Nordic”), in 2016. In recent years, the commercial exhibition industry has continued to consolidate, as evidenced by Cineworld Group’s acquisition of Regal Entertainment Group (“Regal”) in 2018.
 The Company believes that the consolidation of the commercial exhibition industry has helped facilitate the growth of the IMAX network. The Company has historically enjoyed strong relationships with large commercial exhibitor chains, which have greater capital to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire IMAX Theater Systems. As larger commercial chains such as AMC have purchased smaller chains, those smaller chains have in turn become part of the IMAX network. For instance, following AMC’s acquisition of Odeon and Nordic, the Company and AMC entered into an agreement for 25 new IMAX Theater Systems across the Odeon and Nordic network. The Company believes that continued consolidation could facilitate further signings and other strategic benefits going forward.
 However, exhibitor consolidation has also resulted in individual exhibitor chains constituting a material portion of the Company’s revenue and network. Continued industry consolidation, as well as consolidation in the movie studio industry, may present risks to the Company. (See “Risk Factors – Consolidation among commercial exhibitors and studios reduces the breadth of the Company’s customer base, and could result in a narrower market for the Company’s products and reduced negotiating leverage. A deterioration in the Company’s relationship with key partners could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operation. In addition, an adverse economic impact on a significant customer’s business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on the Company.” in Part I, Item 1A.)
 THE IMAX BRAND
 IMAX is a premier global technology platform for entertainment and events. The Company relies on its brand to communicate its leadership and singular goal of creating entertainment experiences that exceed all expectations. Top filmmakers, studios, and other content creators use the IMAX brand to message that a film will connect with audiences in unique and extraordinary ways. In 2020, IMAX launched the “Filmed in IMAX” program, a partnership with the world's leading camera manufacturers to meet filmmaker demand for The IMAX Experience. Through the program, IMAX will certify high-end, best-in-class digital cameras with leading brands including ARRI, Panavision, RED Digital Cinema and Sony to work in the IMAX format when paired with its proprietary post-production process. 
 The IMAX brand is a promise to deliver what today’s movie audiences crave — a memorable, more emotionally engaging, more thrilling and shareable experience. From 2015 to 2019, the Company commissioned leading third-party research firms to conduct multiple consumer research studies in eleven countries. The studies show that the IMAX brand has near universal awareness, creates a special experience for the audience, and is one of the most differentiated movie-going brands. On a standardized measure of brand equity, the IMAX brand ranged from two to 10 times more powerful than other entertainment technology brands. The Company believes that its strong brand equity supports consumers’ predisposition to choose IMAX over competing brands and to pay a premium for The IMAX Experience now and into the future.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 The Company believes that it is a premier global technology platform for entertainment and events with significant proprietary expertise in digital and film-based projection and sound system component design, engineering, and imaging technology, particularly in laser-based technology. The Company rolled out its flagship laser-based projection system at the end of 2014, which is capable of illuminating the largest screens in the Company’s network. This laser-based projection system provides greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, while consuming less power and lasting longer than existing digital technology, to ensure that the Company continues to provide the highest quality, premier movie going experience available to consumers. Since then, the Company has continued research and development aimed at creating more affordable laser-based solutions with various screen sizes for its commercial multiplex customers. Beginning in late 2021, the Company began offering an additional laser-based theater system product to provide a broader array of customers with an opportunity to replace and upgrade IMAX Xenon Theater Systems.
 The Company intends to continue research and development to further evolve its end-to-end technology. This includes bringing connectivity to the Company’s global theater network and experimenting with live and interactive events worldwide; developing new IMAX film cameras and certifying additional digital cameras; further improving its proprietary DMR process for the delivery of content for both theatrical and home entertainment; and further improving the reliability of its projectors, as well as enhancing the Company’s image and sound quality.
 As of December 31, 2021, 34 of the Company’s employees were connected with research and development projects, as compared to 45 employees as of December 31, 2020. 
 MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE 
 Projector Component Manufacturing
 The Company assembles IMAX Theater System projectors at its facility in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (near Toronto). With few exceptions, the Company develops and designs all of the key elements of the proprietary technology involved in this component. Fabrication of a majority of parts and sub-assemblies is subcontracted to a group of carefully pre-qualified third-party suppliers. Manufacture and supply contracts are signed for the delivery of the component on an order-by-order basis. The Company believes its significant suppliers will continue to supply quality products in quantities sufficient to satisfy its needs. The Company inspects all parts and sub-assemblies, completes the final assembly, and then subjects the projector to comprehensive testing individually and as a system prior to shipment. Historically, these projectors, including both IMAX Laser Theater Systems and IMAX Xenon Theater Systems, have had reliability rates based on scheduled shows of approximately 99%.
Sound System Component Manufacturing
 The Company develops, designs, and assembles the key elements of the theater sound system component. The standard IMAX theater sound system component consists of parts from a variety of sources, with approximately 50% of the materials of each sound system attributable to proprietary parts provided under original equipment manufacturers agreements with outside vendors. These proprietary parts include custom loudspeaker enclosures and horns, specialized amplifiers, and signal processing and control equipment. The Company inspects all parts and sub-assemblies, completes the final assembly and then subjects the sound system to comprehensive testing as a system.
Screen and Other Components
 The Company purchases its screen component and glasses cleaning equipment from third parties. The standard screen system component consists of a projection screen manufactured to IMAX specifications and a frame to hang the projection screen. The proprietary glasses cleaning machine is a stand-alone unit that is connected to the theater’s water and electrical supply to automate the cleaning of 3D glasses.
Maintenance and Extended Warranty Services
 The Company provides ongoing maintenance and extended warranty services to IMAX Theater Systems. These arrangements are usually for a separate fee, although the Company sometimes includes free service in the initial year of an arrangement. The maintenance and extended warranty arrangements include service, maintenance and replacement parts for IMAX Theater Systems.
 14

To support the IMAX network, the Company has personnel stationed in major markets throughout the world who provide periodic and emergency maintenance and extended warranty services on existing IMAX Theater Systems. The Company provides various levels of maintenance and warranty services, which are priced accordingly. Under full-service programs, Company personnel typically visit each theater every six months to provide preventative maintenance, cleaning and inspection services and emergency visits to resolve problems and issues with the theater system. Under some arrangements, customers can elect to participate in a service partnership program whereby the Company trains a customer’s technician to carry out certain aspects of maintenance. Under such shared maintenance arrangements, the Company participates in certain of the customer’s maintenance checks each year, provides a specified number of emergency visits and provides spare parts, as necessary. For both IMAX Laser Theater Systems and IMAX Xenon Theater Systems, the Company provides pre-emptive maintenance, remote system monitoring and a network operations center that provides continuous access to product experts.

 HUMAN CAPITAL
 The Company is a globally diverse brand with the mission to connect the world through extraordinary experiences that inspire us to reimagine what’s possible, together. The Company has the power to inspire, ignite and involve its teams, customers and partners across the 1,683 IMAX Theater Systems in its network to transcend the ordinary. However, the Company understands that these experiences are only made possible through its employees’ diverse range of unique abilities and perspectives and its ability to attract, retain, and engage a talented, inclusive and respected workforce.
 The Company is committed to acquiring talent and developing internal talent to create a high-performing, diverse workforce. In order to achieve this objective, the Company offers competitive pay programs and benefits to its people globally.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
 The Company believes that a culture of diversity and inclusion is a competitive advantage that fuels innovation and strengthens a company’s reputation. The Company is committed to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”), and its culture is defined by its core values of Inspire, Ignite, and Involve. The Company’s focus with respect to DE&I is to attract, retain, and engage a talented, inclusive and respected workforce. As a part of its ongoing commitment to expanding its diverse and inclusive workforce, the Company has assembled a DE&I council of employees across levels, tenures and demographic backgrounds to assist the Company in executing the four key pillars of its global DE&I strategy, which includes the following objectives:

• | Raise awareness and educate those around the Company on issues that are important to its people and its audiences.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Empower the Company’s people and leadership to be champions of diversity, equity and inclusion by rewarding positive behaviors and encouraging frequent feedback and input.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Communicate and connect using inclusive and concise messages.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ensure that equal opportunity and diversity of people is non-negotiable in how the Company attracts, selects, supports, develops and rewards its people, and in whom IMAX chooses to partner with.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2021, the DE&I council hosted multiple Company-wide events and launched educational awareness campaigns that represent, support and spark dialogue among the diverse communities that make up IMAX’s workforce. As of December 31, 2021, women represented approximately 36% of the Company’s global workforce. The Company currently has one female director on the Board of Directors (13%) and five female members on the Company’s management team of 17 (29%). Moreover, four members of the Company’s management team identify as ethnically diverse (24%).

Employee Health and Safety
 Recognizing the various employee health and safety risks associated with the delivery of the world’s most immersive movie-going experience, the Company has implemented a global program for workplace safety that ensures it has the necessary controls in place to keep its employees and visitors safe. 
 Employee health and safety is one of the Company’s top priorities. Risks to the health and safety of the Company’s employees are present in day-to-day office work, building renovation, manufacturing, logistics, training, testing, research and development, and during the designing, installation and service of the Company’s theaters around the world. Every employee at each IMAX location, workplace, business unit and department is responsible for participating in workplace safety planning activities and managers are responsible for employee health and safety program implementation for their business function. This effort is supported by a cross-functional Health and Safety team dedicated to employee health and safety and business continuity. 
 This continuous focus on and commitment to the health and safety of the Company’s employees has remained central to the Company’s continued response to COVID-19. Specifically, the Company:
  
• | instituted a cross-functional Pandemic Response team to support decision making and implementation of COVID-19 response programs;
