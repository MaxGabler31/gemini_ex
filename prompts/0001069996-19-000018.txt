ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
GENERAL
FedNat Holding Company (“FNHC,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an insurance holding company that controls substantially all aspects of the insurance underwriting, distribution and claims processes through our subsidiaries and contractual relationships with independent agents and general agents.   We, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, are authorized to underwrite, and/or place homeowners multi-peril (“homeowners”), federal flood and other lines of insurance in Florida and other states. We market, distribute and service our own and third-party insurers’ products and other services through a network of independent and general agents.
FedNat Insurance Company (“FNIC”), our largest wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, is licensed as an admitted carrier, to write specific lines of insurance by the state’s insurance departments, in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama.  Monarch National Insurance Company (“MNIC”), our other insurance subsidiary, is licensed as an admitted carrier in Florida. Admitted carriers are bound by rate and form regulations, and are strictly regulated to protect policyholders. Admitted carriers are also required to financially contribute to the state guarantee fund used to pay for losses if an insurance carrier becomes insolvent or unable to pay loss amounts due to their policyholders. 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, FedNat Underwriters, Inc. (“FNU”), we serve as managing general agent for FNIC and MNIC. MNIC was founded in 2015 through a joint venture. On February 21, 2018, FNIC acquired the non-controlling interests in MNIC’s indirect parent company, Monarch Delaware Holdings LLC (“Monarch Delaware”) from our joint venture partners (see “Monarch National Insurance Company,” below, for more information).

Acquisitions and Joint Ventures
Maison Acquisition
On February 25, 2019, the Company executed a definitive agreement for the acquisition of the insurance operations of 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. ("PIH"). Specifically, the Company will purchase Maison Insurance Company, Maison Managers, Inc., and ClaimCor LLC (collectively, the "Maison Companies"). The purchase price is $51.0 million, which includes $25.5 million in cash and $25.5 million in shares of the Company’s common stock. Additionally, in connection with the pending acquisition, on March 5, 2019, the Company closed on an offering of $100 million of Senior Unsecured Notes due 2029, which bear interest at the annual rate of 7.5% (the "2029 Notes"). The cash from the offering will be used to purchase the Maison Companies, retire the full $45.0 million of outstanding debt (thereby lowering our overall cost of borrowing) and other general corporate purposes. 
Refer to Note 17 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report, for additional information regarding the pending acquisition, including regulatory and other necessary approval and the potential timing thereof.
Monarch National Insurance Company 
In March 2015, we organized MNIC and obtained its certificate of authority to write homeowners property and casualty insurance in Florida from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (the “Florida OIR”). We and Crosswinds Investor Monarch LP (“Crosswinds Investor”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crosswinds Holdings Inc. (“Crosswinds Holdings”), a private equity firm and asset manager, each invested $14.0 million for a 42.4% membership interest (each holding 50.0% of the voting interests in Monarch Delaware). Transatlantic Reinsurance Company (“TransRe”), an international property and casualty reinsurance company invested $5.0 million for a 15.2% non-voting membership interest in Monarch Delaware. TransRe also received a six-year promissory note in the principal amount of $5.0 million bearing an annual interest rate of 6.0% payable by Monarch National Holding Company (“Monarch Holding”), the direct parent of MNIC and wholly-owned subsidiary of Monarch Delaware (together with MNIC and Monarch Holding, the “Monarch Entities”). Crosswinds AUM LLC (“Crosswinds AUM”) provided investment management services to the Monarch Entities pursuant to an investment management agreement between the Monarch Entities and Crosswinds AUM.
-2-

On November 27, 2017, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Crosswinds Investor and TransRe, whereby we agreed to purchase Crosswinds Investor’s 42.4% Class A membership interest and 50.0% voting interest for $12.3 million, and TransRe’s 15.2% non-voting membership interest in Monarch Delaware for $4.4 million. We completed this transaction on February 21, 2018 for the agreed upon purchase price and repaid the outstanding principal balance and interest due on the $5.0 million promissory note to TransRe. Following the closing, Monarch Delaware and Monarch Holdings were dissolved and merged into FNIC. With the completion of these transaction, FNIC owns 100% of MNIC.
Crosswinds AUM continued to serve as a consultant to FNHC for a quarterly fee of $75,000 through December 31, 2018, and a subsidiary of Crosswinds Holdings and TransRe each had a right of first refusal through December 31, 2018 to participate in our catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program.
Refer to Note 14 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report, for additional information regarding the accounting and consolidation of the joint venture, prior to our acquisition of the non-controlling interest.
Material Distribution Relationships
We are a party to an insurance agency master agreement with Ivantage Select Agency, Inc. (“ISA”), an affiliate of Allstate Insurance Company (“Allstate”), pursuant to which we have been authorized by ISA to appoint Allstate agents to offer our homeowners and commercial general liability insurance products to consumers in Florida. 
We are a party to a managing general underwriting agreement with SageSure Insurance Managers, LLC (“SageSure”) in which they underwrite our FNIC homeowners business outside of Florida.

Overview of Insurance Lines of Business
Homeowners Property and Casualty Insurance
FNIC and MNIC underwrite homeowners insurance in Florida and FNIC also underwrites homeowners insurance in Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina and Alabama. Homeowners insurance generally protects an owner of real and personal property against covered causes of loss to that property. As of December 31, 2018, the total homeowners policies in-force was 291,098, of which 246,619 were in Florida and 44,479 were outside of Florida. As of December 31, 2017, the total homeowners policies in-force was 302,925, of which 272,346 were in Florida and 30,579 were outside of Florida. 
Florida
Our homeowners insurance products provide maximum dwelling coverage of approximately $3.6 million, with the aggregate maximum policy limit being approximately $6.3 million. We currently offer dwelling coverage “A” up to $4.0 million with an aggregate total insured value of $6.5 million. We continually review and update these limits. The approximate average premium on the policies currently in-force is $1,873, as compared with $1,785 for 2017. The typical deductible is either $2,500 or $1,000 for non-hurricane-related claims and generally 2% of the coverage amount for the structure for hurricane-related claims.
Premium rates charged to our homeowners insurance policyholders are continually evaluated to assure that they meet the expectation that they are actuarially sound and produce a reasonable level of profit (neither excessive, inadequate or discriminatory). Premium rates in Florida and other states are regulated and approved by the respective states’ office of insurance regulation.  We continuously monitor and seek appropriate adjustment to our rates in order to remain competitive and profitable.
-4-

The following are our rate actions that we have taken across our two insurance subsidiaries:

• | In 2018, FNIC applied for a statewide average rate increase of 4.6% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies, which was approved by the Florida OIR and is expected to be become effective for new and renewal policies on April 20, 2019.


• | In 2017, FNIC applied for a statewide average rate increase of 6.5% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies only, which was subsequently, increased and approved by the Florida OIR to a statewide average rate increase of 10.0% and became effective for new and renewal policies on August 1, 2017.


• | In 2016, FNIC applied for a rate increase of 5.6% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies, which was approved by the Florida OIR and became effective for new and renewal policies on August 1, 2016.


• | In 2017, MNIC applied for a statewide rate increase of 2.0% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies, which was approved by the Florida OIR and became effective for new and renewal policies on October 1, 2017.


• | Lastly, in 2016, MNIC applied for a statewide rate decrease of 11.9% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies, which was approved by the Florida OIR and became effective for new and renewal policies on April 15, 2016.


Non-Florida
Our non-Florida homeowners insurance products, produced through our partnership with SageSure, provide maximum dwelling coverage “A” up to $1.8 million, with the aggregate maximum policy limit being approximately $3.6 million.  The approximate average premium on the policies currently in-force is $1,758, as compared with $1,803 for 2017.   The typical deductible is either $2,500 or $1,000 for non-hurricane-related claims and generally 2% of the coverage amount for the structure for hurricane-related claims.  
As part of our partnership with SageSure, we entered into a profit share agreement, whereby we share 50% of net profits of this line of business, as calculated per the terms of the agreement, subject to certain limitations.
Other Lines of Business
Flood:  FNIC writes flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (“NFIP”). We write the policy for the NFIP, which assumes 100% of the flood risk while we retain a commission for our service. FNIC offers this line of business in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina and Alabama. FNIC plans to file an admitted flood endorsement as an alternative to the NFIP program. 
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
Our independent agents and general agents have the authority to sell and bind insurance coverage in accordance with procedures established by FNU.  FNU generally accepts all coverage that falls within stated underwriting criteria.  For all policies issued, FNU also has the right, within a period that varies by state between 60 days and 120 days from a policy’s inception, to cancel any policy, upon an advanced notice provided in accordance with statutory specific guidelines, even if the risk falls within our underwriting criteria.  We are focusing our marketing efforts on continuing to expand our distribution network while maintaining our commitment to long-term relationships. We market our products and services throughout Florida by establishing relationships with independent agents and general agents, and in other states, through our partnership with SageSure. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals to offer additional insurance products or expand into other states.
We believe that our integrated computer systems, which allow for rapid automated premium quotation and policy issuance by our agents, are key elements in providing quality service to both our agents and insureds for our various lines of business.
LIABILITY FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES
We are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) payments under the terms of the insurance policies that are underwritten by our insurance companies.  In many cases, there may be a time lag between the occurrence and reporting of an insured loss and our payment of that loss. As required by insurance regulations and accounting rules, we reflect the liability for the ultimate payment of all incurred losses and LAE by establishing a liability for those unpaid losses and LAE for both reported and unreported claims, which represent estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses.
When a claim involving a probable loss is reported, we establish a liability for the estimated amount of our ultimate loss and LAE payments. We based our estimate upon such factors as the type of loss, jurisdiction of the occurrence, knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim, severity of injury or damage, potential for ultimate exposure, estimate of liability on the part of the insured, past experience with similar claims and the applicable policy provisions.
We also establish a liability on an aggregate basis to provide for incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). The estimates of the liability for loss and LAE reserves are subject to the effect of trends in claims severity and frequency and are continually reviewed. As part of this 
-5-

process, we review historical data and consider various factors, including known and anticipated legal developments, inflation and economic conditions. As experience develops and other data becomes available, these estimates are revised, as required, resulting in an increase or decrease of the existing liability for loss and LAE reserves. Adjustments are reflected in results of operations in the period in which they are made and the liability may deviate substantially from prior estimates.
Among our classes of insurance, the automobile and homeowners liability claims historically tend to have longer time lapses between the occurrence of the event, the reporting of the claim and the final settlement, than do automobile physical damage and homeowners property claims. These liability claims often involve parties filing suit and therefore may result in litigation. By comparison, property damage claims tend to be reported in a relatively shorter period of time and settled in a shorter time frame with less occurrence of litigation.
REINSURANCE
Reinsurance is used to mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes, manage overall capital adequacy and protect capital resources. We reinsure (cede) a portion of written premiums on an excess of loss or a quota-share basis in order to limit our loss exposure. To the extent that reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations assumed under these reinsurance agreements, we remain primarily liable to our policyholders. 
Reinsurance markets include:

• | Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States (“U.S.”), Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;


• | Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and 


• | Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.

The form of reinsurance that we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:

• | Proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premium and losses to reinsurers;


• | Non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or


• | Facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.

Significant Reinsurance Contracts
FNIC and MNIC operate primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct accounts on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those exceed the desired retention level.  We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.  Our reinsurance contracts do not relieve FNIC or MNIC from their direct obligations to the insured. 
While it is not always possible to reinsure every known and unknown risk to our company, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.  There is a credit risk exposure with respect to ceded losses to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance contracts. The collectability of reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers, interpretation of contract language and other factors.  The availability and amount of ceded premiums and losses associated with the acquisition of reinsurance will vary year to year.  Our reinsurance program is subject to approval primarily by the Florida OIR and other regulators in states where we do business, and subject to review by Demotech, Inc. (“Demotech”). Demotech provides Financial Stability Ratings (“FSR”) for property and casualty insurance companies throughout the United States.
We are selective in choosing reinsurers and consider numerous factors, the most important of which are the financial stability of the reinsurer or capital specifically pledged to uphold the contract, its history of responding to claims and its overall reputation. In an effort to minimize our exposure to the insolvency of a reinsurer, we evaluate the acceptability and review the financial condition of the reinsurer at least annually with the assistance of our reinsurance broker. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had over 75 reinsurance companies on our program which are required to have at least an “A-” or better rating by A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”) or the agreement would need to be fully collateralized.

Refer to Note 5 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report, for further information regarding our reinsurance programs.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we had 318 employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and we have not experienced work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes. We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
COMPETITION
We operate in highly competitive markets and face competition from national, regional and residual market insurance companies in the homeowners and flood insurance markets. Our competitors include companies that market their products through agents and companies that sell insurance directly to their customers. Large national captive writers may have certain competitive advantages over independent agency writers, including increased name recognition, increased loyalty of their customer base and reduced policy acquisition costs. We compete based on underwriting criteria, pricing, our distribution network and superior service to our agents and insureds. Although our pricing is inevitably influenced, to an extent, by that of our competitors, we believe that it is generally not in our best interest to compete solely on price.
In Florida, more than 50 companies compete with us in the homeowners insurance market. Three of our larger competitors are Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (“Citizens”), Universal Property and Casualty Insurance Company and Security First Insurance Company. 
Significant competition also emerged because of fundamental changes made to the property and casualty insurance business in Florida in recent years which resulted in a multi-pronged approach to address the cost of residential property insurance in Florida. First, the law increased the capacity of reinsurance that stabilized the reinsurance market to the benefit of the insurance companies writing in Florida. Second, the law provided for rate relief to all policyholders. The law also authorized the legislatively created insurance company, Citizens, which is free of many of the constraints on private carriers such as minimum surplus, financial ratio requirements, income tax and reinsurance expense, to reduce its premium rates and begin competing against private insurers in the residential property insurance market and expanded the authority of Citizens to write commercial insurance.
REGULATION
Overview
Our current insurance operations are subject to the laws and regulations of Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina, and Alabama. We are subject to employment regulations of Florida and potentially to other states in which we may seek to conduct business in the future. The regulations cover all aspects of our business and are generally designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders, as opposed to the interests of shareholders. Such regulations relate to authorized lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, allowable rates and forms, investment parameters, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, market conduct, maximum amount allowable for premium financing service charges and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of our business. Our failure to comply with certain provisions of applicable insurance laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, any changes in such laws and regulations, including the adoption of consumer initiatives regarding rates charged for coverage, could materially and adversely affect our operations or our ability to expand.
Most states’ laws restrict an insurer’s underwriting discretion, such as the ability to terminate policies, terminate agents or reject insurance coverage applications, and many state regulators have the power to reduce, or to disallow, increases in premium rates. In addition, state laws generally require that rate schedules and other information be filed with the state’s insurance regulatory authority, either directly or through a rating organization with which the insurer is affiliated. The regulatory authority may disapprove a rate filing if it finds that the rates are inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. Rates, which are not necessarily uniform for all insurers, vary by class of business, hazard covered, and size of risk. Certain states, including Florida, as discussed above, have adopted laws or are considering proposed legislation which, among other things, limit the ability of insurance companies to effect rate increases or to cancel, reduce or non-renew insurance coverage with respect to existing policies, particularly personal automobile insurance.

Most states require licensure or regulatory approval prior to the marketing of new insurance products. Typically, licensure review is comprehensive and includes a review of a company’s business plan, solvency, financial projections, reinsurance, character of its officers and directors, rates, forms and other financial and non-financial aspects of a company. The regulatory authorities may prohibit entry into a new market by not granting a license or by withholding approval.

All insurance companies must file quarterly and annual statements with certain regulatory agencies and are subject to regular and special examinations by those agencies. We may be the subject of additional special examinations or analysis. These examinations or analysis may result in one or more corrective orders being issued by the Florida OIR. The Florida OIR has completed their regularly scheduled statutory examination of FNIC for the five years ended December 31, 2015, of MNIC for the period of March 17, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2015 and of MNIC for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no material findings by the Florida OIR in connection with these examinations. 

Various states routinely require deposits of assets for the protection of policyholders either in those states or for all policyholders. As of December 31, 2018, FNIC and MNIC held investment securities with a fair value of approximately $10.3 million, as deposits with the state of Florida, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama.
Insurance Holding Company Regulation
FNHC, as the parent holding company, is subject to laws governing insurance holding companies in Florida where FNIC and MNIC are domiciled. Among other things, these laws: (i) require us to file periodic information with the Florida OIR, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations; (ii) regulate certain transactions between us and our affiliates, including the amount of dividends and other distributions, the terms of surplus notes and amounts that our affiliates can charge the holding company for services such as management fees or commissions; and (iii) restrict the ability of any one person to acquire certain levels of our voting securities without prior regulatory approval. Any purchaser of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be presumed to have acquired control of FNIC or MNIC and is required to file an application with the Florida OIR to obtain approval of such acquisition.
Restrictions in Payments of Dividends by Domestic Insurance Companies
Under Florida law, a domestic insurer may not pay any dividend or distribute cash or other property to its shareholders except out of that part of its available and accumulated capital surplus funds which is derived from realized net operating profits on its business and net realized capital gains. A Florida domestic insurer may not make dividend payments or distributions to shareholders without prior approval of the Florida OIR if the dividend or distribution would exceed the larger of (i) the lesser of (a) 10.0% of its surplus or (b) net income, not including realized capital gains, plus a two-year carryforward, (ii) 10.0% of surplus with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus 25.0% of unrealized capital gains or (iii) the lesser of (a) 10.0% of surplus or (b) net investment income plus a three-year carryforward with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus 25.0% of unrealized capital gains.
Alternatively, a Florida domestic insurer may pay a dividend or distribution without the prior written approval of the Florida OIR: (i) if the dividend is equal to or less than the greater of: (a) 10.0% of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders derived from realized net operating profits on its business and net realized capital gains or (b) the insurer’s entire net operating profits and realized net capital gains derived during the immediately preceding calendar year; (ii) the insurer will have policy holder surplus equal to or exceeding 115.0% of the minimum required statutory surplus after the dividend or distribution; (iii) the insurer files a notice of the dividend or distribution with the Florida OIR at least ten business days prior to the dividend payment or distribution; and (iv) the notice includes a certification by an officer of the insurer attesting that, after the payment of the dividend or distribution, the insurer will have at least 115.0% of required statutory surplus as to policyholders. Except as provided above, a Florida domiciled insurer may only pay a dividend or make a distribution: (i) subject to prior approval by the Florida OIR; or (ii) 30 days after the Florida OIR has received notice of such dividend or distribution and has not disapproved it within such time.
No dividends were paid by FNIC or MNIC in 2018, 2017 and 2016, and none are anticipated in 2019.  Although we believe that amounts required to meet our financial and operating obligations will be available from sources other than dividends from our insurance subsidiaries, there can be no assurance in this regard. Further, there can be no assurance that, if requested, the Florida OIR will allow any dividends to be paid by FNIC or MNIC to FNHC, the parent company, in the future. The maximum dividends permitted by state law are not necessarily indicative of an insurer’s actual ability to pay dividends or other distributions to a parent company, which also may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, which could affect an insurer’s competitive position, the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends. Further, state insurance laws and regulations require that the statutory surplus of an insurance company following any dividend or distribution by it be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs.
While the non-insurance company subsidiaries (FNU and any other affiliate) are not subject directly to the dividend and other distribution limitations, insurance holding company regulations govern the amount that any affiliate within the holding company structure may charge any of the insurance companies for service (e.g., management fees and commissions).

Underwriting and Marketing Restrictions
During the past several years, various regulatory and legislative bodies have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations to address the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, catastrophic events and insurance capacity and pricing. These regulations include: (i) the creation of “market assistance plans” under which insurers are induced to provide certain coverages; (ii) restrictions on the ability of insurers to rescind or otherwise cancel certain policies in mid-term; (iii) advance notice requirements or limitations imposed for certain policy non-renewals; and (iv) limitations upon or decreases in rates permitted to be charged.
National Association of Insurance Commissioners Risk-Based Capital Requirements
In order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), established risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for insurance companies that are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policy holders. These requirements measure four major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: (i) underwriting risks, which encompass the risk of adverse loss development and inadequate pricing; (ii) declines in asset values arising from credit risk; (iii) other business risks from investments; and (iv) catastrophe risk. Insurers having less statutory surplus than required will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. The Florida OIR, which follows these requirements, could require FNIC or MNIC to cease operations in the event they fail to maintain the required statutory capital.

Based upon the 2018 and 2017 statutory financial statements for FNIC and MNIC, statutory surplus exceeded the regulatory action levels established by the NAIC’s RBC requirements.

Based on RBC requirements, the extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the ratio of an insurer’s statutory surplus to its Authorized Control Level (“ACL”), as calculated under the NAIC’s requirements, decreases.  The first action level, the Company Action Level, requires an insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the insurance regulators if statutory surplus falls below 200.0% of the ACL amount.  The second action level, the Regulatory Action Level, requires an insurer to submit a plan containing corrective actions and permits the insurance regulators to perform an examination or other analysis and issue a corrective order if statutory surplus falls below 150.0% of the ACL amount. The third action level, ACL, allows the regulators to rehabilitate or liquidate an insurer in addition to the aforementioned actions if statutory surplus falls below the ACL amount. The fourth action level is the Mandatory Control Level, which requires the regulators to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer if statutory surplus falls below 70.0% of the ACL amount. FNIC’s ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL was 329.9% and 301.9% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. MNIC’s ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL was 774.4% and 1,070.1% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Industry Ratings Services

Third-party rating agencies assess and rate the ability of insurers to pay their claims. The insurance industry uses financial strength ratings to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers. Ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies and reflect evaluations of each insurer’s profitability, debt and cash levels, customer base, adequacy and soundness of reinsurance, quality and estimated market value of assets, adequacy of reserves and management. Ratings are also based upon factors of concern to agents, reinsurers and policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors, such as purchasers of our common stock.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, FNIC and MNIC are rated by Demotech as “A” (“Exceptional”), which is the third of seven ratings, and defined as “Regardless of the severity of a general economic downturn or deterioration in the insurance cycle, insurers earning an FSR of “A” possess “Exceptional” financial stability related to maintaining surplus as regards to policyholders.” Demotech’s ratings are based upon factors of concern to agents, reinsurers and policyholders and are not primarily directed toward the protection of investors. Our Demotech rating could be jeopardized by factors including adverse development and various surplus related ratio exceptions. On November 21, 2018, Demotech reaffirmed the FSR of “A” (“Exceptional”) for FNIC and MNIC.
