--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, clinical development and commercialization of innovative, small molecule drugs that address underserved medical needs primarily in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders by targeting intracellular signaling mechanisms within the central nervous system, or CNS. In December 2019, CAPLYTA® (lumateperone) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults (42mg/day) and we initiated the commercial launch of CAPLYTA in late March 2020. In December 2021, CAPLYTA was approved by the FDA for the treatment of bipolar depression in adults (42mg/day). We initiated the commercial launch of CAPLYTA for the treatment of bipolar depression in late December 2021. As used in this report, “CAPLYTA” refers to lumateperone approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and for the treatment of bipolar depression in adults, and “lumateperone” refers to, where applicable, CAPLYTA as well as lumateperone for the treatment of indications beyond schizophrenia and bipolar depression. 
Our Product 
 In December 2019, CAPLYTA was approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults (42mg/day) and we initiated the commercial launch of CAPLYTA in late March 2020. In support of our commercialization efforts, we employ a national salesforce. In December 2021, CAPLYTA was approved by the FDA for the treatment of bipolar depression in adults (42mg/day). CAPLYTA is the only FDA-approved treatment for depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder (bipolar depression) in adults as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. We initiated the commercial launch of CAPLYTA for the treatment of bipolar depression in late December 2021. In support of the commercial launch of lumateperone for the treatment of bipolar depression, we have expanded our sales force from approximately 240 sales representatives to approximately 320 sales representatives. 
 The efficacy of CAPLYTA 42 mg in schizophrenia was demonstrated in two placebo-controlled trials, showing a statistically significant separation from placebo on the primary endpoint, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or PANSS, total score. The most common adverse reactions (>5% and twice the rate of placebo) for the recommended dose of CAPLYTA versus placebo were somnolence/sedation (24% vs. 10%) and dry mouth (6% vs. 2%). In pooled data from short term studies, mean changes from baseline in weight gain, fasting glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol were similar between CAPLYTA and placebo. The incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was 6.7% for CAPLYTA and 6.3% for placebo. 
 The efficacy of CAPLYTA 42 mg in bipolar depression was demonstrated in two positive Phase 3 placebo-controlled bipolar depression studies, which evaluated the effects of CAPLYTA on depression in adult patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder both as monotherapy (Study 404) and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate (Study 402). In these studies, the efficacy of CAPLYTA 42 mg was established by demonstrating statistically significant improvements over placebo for the change from baseline in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating scale, or MADRS, total score at week 6. CAPLYTA 42 mg also showed a statistically significant improvement in the key secondary endpoint relating to clinical global impression of bipolar disorder in each study. In addition, CAPLYTA demonstrated a favorable tolerability and safety profile consistent with 
 
3 

  findings in prior clinical studies in schizophrenia. The most common reported adverse reactions (occurring at a rate of 5% or more and at least twice the rate of placebo) were somnolence/sedation, dizziness, nausea, and dry mouth. Mean changes from baseline in weight, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol were similar between CAPLYTA and placebo. 
 Our Development Programs 
 Our pipeline includes several product candidates in clinical development and additional product candidates in preclinical testing. We believe that our product candidates offer innovative therapeutic approaches and may provide advantages relative to current therapies. The following table summarizes our product candidates and programs: 
OUR THERAPEUTIC PIPELINE 
 

The safety and efficacy of investigational agents and/or investigational uses of approved products have not been established. 
 Lumateperone Development Program 
 The efficacy of lumateperone could be mediated through a combination of antagonist activity at central serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and postsynaptic antagonist activity at central dopamine D2 receptors. In terms of pharmacodynamics, lumateperone has high binding affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and moderate binding affinity for dopamine D2 receptors, serotonin transporters, dopamine D1 receptors, dopamine D4 receptors and adrenergic alpha 1A and alpha 1B receptors. It lacks biologically relevant interactions with other receptors including muscarinic and histaminergic receptors. As a result, we believe lumateperone may represent a potential treatment across multiple therapeutic indications. 
 Lumateperone for the treatment of major depressive disorder and other mood disorders 
 As a potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonist and serotonin reuptake inhibitor we believe that lumateperone could improve symptoms of depression with fewer side effects than currently marketed antipsychotics and antidepressants. Dopamine modulation by lumateperone may also reduce irritability and aggression that can accompany many mood disorders. Lumateperone, as a standalone agent, indirectly enhances glutamatergic 
 
4 

  neurotransmission through both AMPA and NMDA channels in the prefrontal cortex via lumateperone’s dopamine D1 receptor activation. By enhancing AMPA neurotransmission, lumateperone also activates key proteins in the mTOR pathway which has shown antidepressant effects. As such, lumateperone may represent a potential treatment for mood disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
 Lumateperone is in Phase 3 clinical development as a novel treatment for MDD. Patient enrollment in Study 501 and Study 502, our global Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating lumateperone 42 mg as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD has commenced. We expect to file a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, with the FDA for approval of lumateperone as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD in 2024. In the first quarter of 2020, as part of our lumateperone bipolar depression clinical program, we initiated our third monotherapy Phase 3 study, Study 403, evaluating lumateperone as monotherapy in the treatment of major depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder. Following the positive results in our adjunctive study that was part of our bipolar depression clinical program, Study 402, we amended Study 403 to evaluate major depressive episodes with mixed features in bipolar disorder in patients with Bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder and mixed features in patients with MDD. We expect to complete Study 403 in the second half of 2022 and following completion we intend to discuss the results with the FDA to determine whether Study 403, as amended, will provide supportive data for a potential future regulatory filing for this indication. 
 We have also initiated a Phase 3 study evaluating lumateperone for the prevention of relapse in patients with schizophrenia. The study is being conducted in five phases consisting of a screening phase, a 6-week, open-label run-in phase during which all patients will receive 42 mg of lumateperone per day, a 12-week, open-label stabilization phase during which all patients will receive 42 mg of lumateperone per day; a double-blind treatment phase 26 weeks in duration during which patients receive either 42 mg of lumateperone per day or placebo (1:1 ratio) and a 2-week safety follow-up phase. This study is being conducted in accordance with our post approval marketing commitment to the FDA in connection with the approval of CAPLYTA for the treatment of schizophrenia as is typical for antipsychotics. 
 Other Indications for Lumateperone 
 Within the lumateperone portfolio, we are also developing a long-acting injectable, or LAI, formulation to provide more treatment options to patients suffering from mental illness. We have completed the preclinical development of an LAI formulation and in December 2020 we initiated a Phase 1 single ascending dose study of lumateperone LAI, a formulation of lumateperone designed to be administered subcutaneously and to maintain therapeutic levels of lumateperone for at least one month. This study is evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of lumateperone LAI in patients with stable symptoms of schizophrenia. We are now exploring alternate sites of injection with this formulation as well as progressing other formulations. This will assist us in evaluating dosing strategies and formulation for our efficacy studies. The goal of our program is to develop LAI formulations that are effective, safe and well tolerated with treatment durations of one month and longer. Given the encouraging tolerability data to date with oral lumateperone, we believe that an LAI option, in particular, may lend itself to being an important formulation choice for certain patients. 
 We hold exclusive, worldwide commercialization rights to lumateperone and a family of compounds from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company pursuant to an exclusive license. 
 Other Product Candidates 
 We are developing ITI-1284-ODT-SL for the treatment of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia, the treatment of dementia-related psychosis and for the treatment of certain depressive disorders, in the elderly. ITI-1284-ODT-SL is a deuterated form of lumateperone, a new molecular entity formulated as an oral disintegrating tablet for sublingual administration. ITI-1284-ODT-SL is formulated as an oral solid dosage form 
 
5 

 that dissolves almost instantly when placed under the tongue, allowing for ease of use in the elderly and may be particularly beneficial for patients who have difficulty swallowing conventional tablets. Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy volunteers and healthy elderly volunteers (> than 65 years of age) evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ITI-1284-ODT-SL. In these studies, there were no reported serious adverse events in either age group. In the elderly cohort, reported adverse events were infrequent with the most common adverse event being transient dry mouth (mild). Based on these results, we have initiated our program evaluating ITI-1284-ODT-SL for the treatment of agitation in patients with probable Alzheimer’s disease. We are in discussions with the FDA regarding the non-clinical toxicological profile of ITI-1284-ODT-SL. The FDA has informed us that they do not believe the deuterated and undeuterated forms of lumateperone are identical. As a result, the non-clinical data from lumateperone may not be broadly applied to ITI-1284-ODT-SL and we may be required to conduct additional toxicology studies in non-rodent species and this could delay the commencement of our clinical program. We expect to commence clinical conduct in this program in 2022. Additional studies in dementia-related psychosis, and certain depressive disorders in the elderly are also planned for 2022. 
 We have another major program that has yielded a portfolio of compounds that selectively inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 1, or PDE1. PDE1 enzymes are highly active in multiple disease states and our PDE1 inhibitors are designed to reestablish normal function in these disease states. Abnormal PDE1 activity is associated with cellular proliferation and activation of inflammatory cells. Our PDE1 inhibitors ameliorate both of these effects in animal models. We intend to pursue the development of our phosphodiesterase, or PDE, program, for the treatment of aberrant immune system activation in several CNS and non-CNS conditions with a focus on diseases where excessive PDE1 activity has been demonstrated and increased inflammation is an important contributor to disease pathogenesis. Our potential disease targets include heart failure, immune system regulation, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers and other non-CNS disorders. Lenrispodun (ITI-214) is our lead compound in this program. Following the favorable safety and tolerability results in our Phase 1 program, we initiated our development program for lenrispodun for Parkinson’s disease and commenced patient enrollment in the third quarter of 2017 in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of lenrispodun in patients with Parkinson’s disease to evaluate safety and tolerability in this patient population, as well as motor and non-motor exploratory endpoints. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced that the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of lenrispodun has been completed and topline results demonstrated lenrispodun was generally well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile and clinical signs consistent with improvements in motor symptoms and dyskinesias. We have initiated our Phase 2 clinical program with lenrispodun for Parkinson’s disease and expect to commence patient enrollment in the first half of 2022. In addition, in the second quarter of 2020, we announced topline results from Study ITI-214-104, a Phase 1/2 translational study of single ascending doses of lenrispodun in patients with chronic systolic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In this study, lenrispodun improved cardiac output by increasing heart contractility and decreasing vascular resistance. Agents that both increase heart contractility (inotropism) and decrease vascular resistance (vasodilation) are called inodilators. Inodilators in current clinical use are associated with the development of arrhythmias, which are abnormal heart rhythms that when serious can impair heart function and lead to mortality. Lenrispodun, which acts through a novel mechanism of action, was not associated with arrhythmias in this study and was generally well-tolerated in all patients. 
 We also have a development program with our ITI-333 compound as a potential treatment for substance use disorders, pain and psychiatric comorbidities including depression and anxiety. There is a pressing need to develop new drugs to treat opioid addiction and safe, effective, non-addictive treatments to manage pain. ITI-333 is a novel compound that uniquely combines activity as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and a partial agonist at µ-opioid receptors. These combined actions support the potential utility of ITI-333 in the treatment of opioid use disorder and associated comorbidities (e.g., depression, anxiety, sleep disorders) without opioid-like safety and tolerability concerns. In December 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 single ascending dose study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ITI-333 in healthy volunteers. This study was recently completed and ITI-333 achieved plasma exposures at or above those required for efficacy and was generally safe and well-tolerated. We have received a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse under the Helping to End Addiction Long-term Initiative, or NIH HEAL Initiative, that 
 
6 

  we expect will fund a significant portion of the early stage clinical development costs associated with this program. 
 Our Drug Discovery Platform and Capabilities 
 Based on the pioneering efforts of our late co-founder and Nobel laureate, Dr. Paul Greengard, we have developed a detailed understanding of intracellular signaling pathways and intracellular targets. We have used that knowledge to develop several state of the art technology platforms, including one called CNSProfileTM. This technology monitors the phosphoprotein changes elicited by major psychotropic drug classes and subclasses, and generates a unique molecular signature for drug compounds. By monitoring how the levels of these phosphoproteins change in vivo, we identify intracellular signaling pathways through which several major drug classes operate. Along with what we believe to be state of the art drug discovery efforts, we have used, and may continue to use, this information as a tool to validate our selection of preclinical candidate molecules. 
 Given the nature of our research and development and business activities, we do not expect that compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws will result in material costs or have a significant negative effect on our operations. 
 Disease and Market Overview 
 Our programs for small molecule therapeutics are designed to address various CNS and other diseases that we believe are underserved or unmet by currently available therapies and that represent large potential commercial market opportunities for us. Background information on the diseases and related commercial markets that may be addressed by our programs is set forth below. 
Schizophrenia 
 Schizophrenia is a disabling and chronic mental illness that is characterized by multiple symptoms during an acute phase of the disorder that can include so-called “positive” symptoms, such as hallucinations, hearing voices, grandiose beliefs and suspiciousness or paranoia. These symptoms can be accompanied by additional, harder to treat symptoms, such as social withdrawal, blunted emotional response and speech deficits, collectively referred to as “negative” symptoms, difficulty concentrating and disorganized thoughts, or cognitive impairment, depression and insomnia. Such residual symptoms often persist even after the acute positive symptoms subside, and contribute substantially to the social and employment disability associated with schizophrenia. 
 According to the American Psychiatric Association and the National Institute of Mental Health, about 1% of the population (2.4 million adults in the United States) suffer from schizophrenia in any given year. A landmark study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness, also referred to as CATIE, which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine in September 2005, found that 74% of patients taking typical or atypical antipsychotics discontinued treatment within 18 months because of side effects or lack of efficacy. 
 Bipolar Disorder 
 Bipolar disorder, sometimes referred to as manic-depressive illness, is characterized by extreme shifts in mood. Individuals with bipolar disorder may experience intense feelings of over-excitement, irritability, impulsivity with grandiose beliefs and racing thoughts, referred to as a manic episode. Symptoms of depression may include feeling tired, hopeless and sad, with difficulty concentrating and thoughts of suicide. Some people experience both types of symptoms in the same “mixed” episode. Severe symptoms of bipolar disorder can be associated with hallucinations or delusions, otherwise referred to as psychosis. 
 According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 4.4% of adults in the United States (approximately 11 million adults in the United States) experience bipolar disorder at some time in their lives.

  Bipolar disorder is often treated with antipsychotic medications alone or in combination with mood stabilizers. The side effects and safety risks associated with antipsychotic drugs in patients with bipolar disorder are similar to those experienced by patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, a large national research program conducted from 1998 to 2005 called the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder, or STEP-BD, followed 4,360 patients with bipolar disorder long term and showed that about half of patients who were treated for bipolar disorder, still experienced lingering and recurrent symptoms, indicating a clear need for improved treatments. 
 Major Depressive Disorder 
 Major depressive disorder, or MDD, is a brain disorder that can be associated with symptoms of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, feelings of guilt, irritability, loss of interest in formerly pleasurable activities, cognitive impairment, disturbed sleep patterns, and suicide ideation or behavior. Different people may experience different symptoms, but everyone with major depression experiences symptoms that are severe enough to interfere with everyday functioning, such as the ability to concentrate at work or school, social interactions, eating and sleeping. Sometimes the depressive episode can be so severe it is accompanied by psychosis (hallucinations and delusions). 
 According to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately 7.8% of adults experience MDD each year. The antidepressant market is primarily composed of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as escitalopram and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, such as duloxetine. Antipsychotics such as quetiapine, aripriprazole and Rexulti® are also used as adjunctive treatments with antidepressant treatment. The National Institute of Mental Health-funded Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression, or STAR*D, study showed that only one-third of treated patients experience complete remission of depressive symptoms. Nearly two-thirds of patients with depression do not fully recover on an anti-depressant medication. 
 Behavioral Disturbances in Dementia 
 The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 55 million people worldwide have dementia, and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year. The Alzheimer’s Association estimated more than 6 million Americans were living with Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) in 2021. While the diagnostic criteria for AD and other dementias mostly focus on the related cognitive deficits, it is often the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms that are most troublesome for caregivers and lead to poor quality of life for patients. Several behavioral symptoms are quite prevalent in patients with dementia, including patients with AD. In view of the potential multiple effects of lumateperone on aggression, agitation, sleep disorders and depression, and its safety profile to date, we believe that lumateperone may provide a novel therapy for treating the behavioral disturbances accompanying dementia, including AD. 
 The FDA has not approved any drug to treat the behavioral symptoms of dementia, including AD. We believe there is a large unmet medical need for a safe and effective therapy to treat the behavioral symptoms in patients with dementia, including AD. 
 Parkinson’s Disease 
 Parkinson’s disease is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that involves malfunction and death of neurons in a region of the brain that controls movement. This neurodegeneration creates a shortage of an important brain signaling chemical, or neurotransmitter, known as dopamine, thereby rendering patients unable to direct or control their movements in a normal manner. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by well-known motor symptoms, including tremors, limb stiffness, slowness of movements, and difficulties with posture and balance, as well as by non-motor symptoms, which include sleep disturbances, mood disorders, cognitive impairment and psychosis. Parkinson’s disease progresses slowly in most people and the severity of symptoms tends to worsen over time. 
 
8 

  According to the National Parkinson Foundation, about 1 million people in the United States and more than 10 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. Parkinson’s disease is more common in people over 60 years of age, and the prevalence of this disease is expected to increase significantly as the average age of the population increases. Parkinson’s disease patients are commonly treated with dopamine replacement therapies, such as levodopa, commonly referred to as L-DOPA, which is metabolized to dopamine, and dopamine agonists, which are molecules that mimic the action of dopamine. Global Data estimated global sales of therapeutics such as L-DOPA, and dopamine agonists used to treat the disease to be nearly $4 billion in 2021. 
 Non-motor symptoms can be particularly distressing and even more troublesome to patients with Parkinson’s disease than the primary motor disturbances. Non-motor symptoms substantially contribute to the burden of Parkinson’s disease and deeply affect the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease are associated with increased caregiver stress and burden, nursing home placement, and increased morbidity and mortality. 
 Treatment of non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease poses a challenge to physicians. Current dopamine replacement drugs used to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease do not help, and sometimes worsen, the non-motor symptoms. We believe there is a large unmet medical need for the treatment of non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease. 
 Heart Failure 
 Heart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs for blood and oxygen. In some types of heart failure, the left ventricle loses its ability to contract normally. The heart is unable to pump with enough force to push enough blood into circulation (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction). Eventually the heart and body cannot compensate, and the person experiences fatigue, breathing problems or other symptoms. 
 Approximately 6.2 million adults in the United States have heart failure. About half of people who develop heart failure die within 5 years of diagnosis. Heart failure cost the nation an estimated $30.7 billion in 2021. This total includes the cost of health care services, medications to treat heart failure, and missed days of work. Current treatments prolong life and improve the heart’s function, but there is no cure. There is a pressing need for improved treatments to improve and reverse these changes in cardiac function. 
 Opioid Use Disorder 
 According to the 2019 CDC annual surveillance report of drug-related risks and outcomes, opioid misuse is widespread with over 10 million Americans reporting opioid misuse and nearly 50,000 opioid overdose deaths reported in the United States. The opioid crisis was declared a public health emergency in 2017. Opioids are a class of drugs that include the illegal drug heroin, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, and pain relievers available legally by prescription, including oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine and morphine. Opioids produce high levels of positive reinforcement, increasing the odds that people will continue using them despite negative consequences. Opioid use disorder is a chronic lifelong disorder, with serious potential consequences including disability, relapses, and death. While medications including methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone are approved to treat opioid use disorder, these medications do not effectively treat psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., mood and anxiety disorders) that may drive opioid use/abuse or dysphoria or the dysphoria and mood disturbances (e.g., depression and anxiety) that often accompany opioid withdrawal and abstinence. 
Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of CNS diseases and other diseases in order to improve the lives of people suffering from such illnesses. Using our

  key understanding of intracellular signaling, we seek to accomplish our goal, using our in-house expert drug discovery and clinical development teams, in two ways: 
 

• | we seek to have the capability to develop first-in-class medications with novel mechanisms that have the potential to treat CNS diseases and other diseases for which there are no previously marketed drugs; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we seek to develop drugs that either can differentiate themselves in competitive markets by addressing aspects of CNS diseases and other diseases which are not adequately treated by currently marketed drugs or can be effective with fewer side effects.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The key elements of our strategy are to:

** | We have filed patent term extension applications on two U.S. patents. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, has not completed its review of these applications. In the United States, we are permitted to extend the term of one U.S. patent for lumateperone or the use thereof. Accordingly, on completion of the USPTO’s review of our patent term extension applications, we must select one of the two patents to which any patent term extension granted will attach. Patent terms may be subject to change not only due to potential patent term extensions but also to any terminal disclaimer that reduces patent term, as well as other factors. Because the U.S. patent laws and related judicial interpretations change, modifications or new interpretations of the laws may impact our patent terms.

Our ITI-1284 program relates to novel lumateperone derivatives for the treatment of behavioral disturbances associated with dementia, and other central nervous system disorders. Six families of patent applications have 
 
11 

  been filed, which have already resulted in seven U.S. patents and fifteen foreign patents. The ITI-1284 molecule has composition of matter protection to 2037, with possible extensions and additional Orange Book-listable protection to 2042. 
 Our program on PDE1 inhibitors for cognition, dopamine-mediated and other disorders, cardiovascular disorders, as well as several others, includes patent protection across 52 families, including 31 families for the lead molecule, lenrispodun, as well as a wide range of filings on other proprietary compounds and indications. The lenrispodun lead molecule has composition of matter protection to 2029, with possible extensions and additional Orange Book-listable protection to 2034. Additionally, we expect to have data exclusivity in the European Union for up to 11 years from commercial launch. We have obtained patent coverage for lenrispodun in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, including heart failure, that extends to 2034. We are also evaluating potential follow-on compounds for lenrispodun which would have patent protection beyond 2030. 
 Our ITI-333 program relates to novel compounds for the non-addictive treatment of pain and for the treatment of opiate use disorder. 16 families of patent applications have been filed, including four families which have already resulted in four U.S. patents and one EP grant, as well as four other foreign grants. These patent families will protect the lead compound, as well as many other analogs under development, beyond 2037 (exclusive of any patent term extensions and regulatory exclusivities). 
 We have also filed patent applications on novel proprietary targets and lead compounds for AD, which would provide compound protection beyond 2028 or beyond 2034, depending on which compound is ultimately selected for development. 
 License Agreement 
 The Bristol-Myers Squibb License Agreement 
 On May 31, 2005, we entered into a worldwide, exclusive License Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, pursuant to which we hold a license to certain patents and know-how of BMS relating to lumateperone and other specified compounds. The agreement was amended on November 3, 2010. The licensed rights are exclusive, except BMS retains rights in specified compounds in the fields of obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. However, BMS has no right to use, develop or commercialize lumateperone and other specified compounds in any field of use. We have the right to grant sublicenses of the rights conveyed by BMS. We are obliged under the license to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed technology. We are also prohibited from engaging in the clinical development or commercialization of specified competitive compounds. 
 Under the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $1.0 million to BMS, a milestone payment of $1.25 million in December 2013, and a milestone payment of $1.5 million in December 2014 following the initiation of our first Phase 3 clinical trial for lumateperone for patients with schizophrenia. Upon FDA acceptance of a New Drug Application, or NDA, filing for lumateperone, we were obligated to pay BMS a $2.0 million milestone payment. The FDA accepted our NDA filing for lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia in the third quarter of 2018 and, as a result, we paid the milestone payment in the first quarter of 2019. The FDA approved our NDA filing on December 23, 2019 and as a result, we accrued $5.0 million related to that milestone in the fourth quarter of 2019 which was paid in the first quarter of 2020. Remaining potential milestone payments under the agreement with respect to lumateperone total $5.0 million if approvals to market the product are received in certain countries outside the U.S. Under the agreement, we may be obliged to make other milestone payments to BMS, for licensed products other than lumateperone, of up to an aggregate of approximately $14.75 million. We are also obliged to make tiered single digit percentage royalty payments ranging between 5 – 9% on sales of licensed products. We are obliged to pay to BMS a percentage of non-royalty payments made in consideration of any sublicense. 
 The agreement extends, and royalties are payable, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, through the later of ten years after first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country, expiration of the 
 
12 

  last licensed patent covering a licensed product, its method of manufacture or use, or the expiration of other government grants providing market exclusivity, subject to certain rights of the parties to terminate the agreement on the occurrence of certain events. On termination of the agreement, we may be obliged to convey to BMS rights in developments relating to a licensed compound or licensed product, including regulatory filings, research results and other intellectual property rights. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of CAPLYTA or any of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished product for commercial sales of CAPLYTA and for our preclinical research and clinical trials, including our ongoing and anticipated trials. We believe that we would be able to contract with other third-party contract manufacturers to obtain API if our existing sources of API were no longer available, but there is no assurance that API would be available from other third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms, on the timeframe that our business would require, or at all. 
The Siegfried Supply Agreement 
 On January 4, 2017, we entered into a supply agreement, or the Siegfried Agreement, with Siegfried Evionnaz SA, or Siegfried. Under the Siegfried Agreement, Siegfried has agreed to manufacture and supply the API for lumateperone in commercial quantities. We agreed to provide Siegfried with a rolling forecast of our anticipated requirements for supply of the API. Under the agreement, our purchase prices for supply of the API from Siegfried are specified prices based on the volume of API produced. The initial term of the Siegfried Agreement was five years, and in December 2021, the term was extended to January 4, 2023. Either party may terminate the agreement prior to its expiration upon an uncured material breach by the other party, the liquidation or dissolution of the other party, the commencement of insolvency procedures or other bankruptcy-related proceedings that are not dismissed within a certain period of time, the appointment of any receiver, trustee or assignee to take possession of the properties of the other party, the cessation of all or substantially all of the other party’s business operations, a continuing force majeure event affecting the other party, or the debarment or certain other events involving the other party’s employees, affiliates or agents. Under the Siegfried Agreement, we have the right to and may purchase the API for lumateperone from other suppliers. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has committed to purchasing production campaigns of API from Siegfried that are expected to be delivered in the first half of 2022 through 2023. 
The Lonza Manufacturing Services Agreement 
 On January 10, 2017, we entered into a manufacturing services agreement, or the Lonza Agreement, with Lonza Ltd., or Lonza. Under the Lonza Agreement, Lonza has agreed to manufacture lumateperone, with purchase prices determined in each project plan. We agreed to provide Lonza with a written forecast of our estimated quarterly requirements. The term of the Lonza Agreement ends on the later of the seventh anniversary of the effective date of the agreement or five years after the first marketing approval by the FDA or European Medicines Agency, or EMA, of lumateperone from the Lonza facility for commercial supply. Either party may terminate the agreement prior to its expiration upon a prior written notice, an uncured material breach by the other party, the insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or bankruptcy of the other party, or a continuing force majeure event affecting the other party, and may be extended by mutual consent. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has committed to purchasing a production campaign of API from Lonza that is expected to be delivered in the second half of 2022. 
 Development and commercial quantities of any products that we develop will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing contractors.

  Commercial Operations 
 We initiated the commercial launch of CAPLYTA in the United States in late March 2020. In support of our commercialization efforts, we hired a national sales force initially consisting of approximately 240 sales representatives, and in support of the commercial launch of CAPLYTA for the treatment of bipolar depression in December 2021, we expanded our sales force to approximately 320 sales representatives. In the future, we may choose to commercialize CAPLYTA or any other products, in markets outside of the United States, if approved for sale in such markets, by establishing one or more strategic alliances. 
Customers 
 We are currently approved to sell CAPLYTA for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and for the treatment of bipolar depression in adults in the U.S. market. CAPLYTA is priced in line with other currently marketed branded antipsychotics indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of bipolar depression. We distribute CAPLYTA principally through three third-party wholesale drug distributors whose concentration are between 28% and 40% of total sales. 
Competition 
 We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies, both in the United States and abroad. We compete, or will compete, with existing and new products being developed by our competitors. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that our research and development programs target. 
 Even if we are successful in commercializing CAPLYTA and developing and obtaining approval of our product candidates, we would compete with a variety of established drugs in the areas of our targeted CNS therapeutic indications. CAPLYTA for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of bipolar depression competes with, among other branded products, Latuda®, marketed by Sunovion, Rexulti®, marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical, VRAYLAR®, marketed by Allergan, LYBALVI®, marketed by Alkermes, and Fanapt®, marketed by Vanda Pharmaceuticals. In addition, CAPLYTA competes and our product candidates, if approved, would compete with, among other generic antipsychotic products, aripiprazole, haloperidol, paliperidone, risperidone, quetiapine/XR, olanzapine and clozapine. 
 In addition, the companies described above and other competitors may have a variety of drugs in development or be awaiting FDA approval that could reach the market and become established before our approved product is established in the market or before we are able to sell our product candidates, if approved. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any drugs that we may develop. Many of our competitors are using technologies or methods different or similar to ours to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small molecule drugs. Many of our competitors and their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do in the following: 
 

• | identifying and validating targets;
--+------------------------------------


• | screening compounds against targets;
--+-------------------------------------


• | preclinical studies and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtaining FDA and other regulatory clearances.
--+-----------------------------------------------


In addition, many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater advantages in the following areas: 
 

• | capital resources;
--+-------------------


• | research and development resources;
--+------------------------------------



14 

  
• | manufacturing capabilities; and
--+--------------------------------


• | sales and marketing.
--+---------------------


Smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved by the FDA or are in advanced development. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, may succeed in developing technologies or drugs that are more effective, safer, and more affordable or more easily administered than ours and may achieve patent protection or commercialize drugs sooner than us. Developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Government Regulation 
 United States—FDA Process 
 The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, import and export, distribution and marketing, among other things, of drug products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning letters, fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. 
 Drug Approval Process. None of our drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval. Such approval can take many years to obtain and may be rejected by the FDA at a number of steps. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following: 

• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the API and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of FDA inspections of clinical trial sites to assure that data supporting the safety and effectiveness of product candidates has been generated in compliance with Good Clinical Practices; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply 
 
15 

  with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. The FDA, sponsor or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, may place a study on hold at any time during development. 
 Clinical trials involve administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be provided to the FDA as part of a separate submission to the IND. Further, an IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial, must review and approve the study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects for any clinical trial before it commences at that center, and the IRB must monitor the study until it is completed. There are also requirements governing reporting of on-going clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials necessary for product approval typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. 
 

• | Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into a limited population, typically healthy humans, to evaluate its short-term safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to (i) evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; (ii) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and (iii) evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 trials, commonly referred to as pivotal studies, are undertaken in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers to further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety by using the drug in its final form.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The FDA or an IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given an opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach an agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug. A sponsor may request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, to reach an agreement with the FDA that the protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness in the indication studied. If such an agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record, and it will be binding on the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific 
 
16 

  issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product after clinical studies begin, or if the sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. There is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to an SPA. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of preclinical studies and of clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, which is waived for the first NDA submitted by a qualifying small business. The NDA is subject to a sixty-day acceptance period, and if sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, will be filed by the FDA at the end of that period. For NDAs that are assigned a standard review designation, the FDA’s goal is to complete its review ten months from the date the FDA files the NDA and, for priority review of those NDAs, six months from the date the FDA files the NDA. These goals can be extended by the FDA through requests for additional information from the sponsor. 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. The FDA will review the NDA and may deem it to be inadequate to support approval, and we cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also refer the application to the appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA inspects the facility or the facilities at which the drug and/or its active pharmaceutical ingredient is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing is in compliance with cGMPs. If the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities are deemed acceptable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or in some cases a Complete Response Letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy, or impose other conditions. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or additional clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials is not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Alternatively, the FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to mitigate risks of the drug, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. Once the FDA approves a drug, the FDA may withdraw product approval if on-going regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. 
 Post-Approval Requirements. After a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical trials. In 
 
17 

   addition, certain changes to an approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes, or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain additional approvals from the FDA, typically through the submission and approval of a supplemental NDA. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical trials be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all. 
 If post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA are required to (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA and maintain pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events; (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products; and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMPs after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities, which includes assessment of on-going compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. We intend to continue to use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including recall of the product from the market or withdrawal of approval of the NDA for that drug. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the extension must be requested prior to expiration of the patent. Also, the approval must be the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the active ingredient under the relevant provision of law. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. We have applied for, and in the future we intend to apply for, restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 
 Data and market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an 
 
18 

   applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct, or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies, adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The FDCA also provides seven years of market exclusivity for a drug designated for a rare disease or condition (e.g., a disease or condition that affects less than 200,000 people in the United States). The exclusivity prohibits the approval of the same drug for the same disease or condition, unless there is a showing of clinical superiority. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials and approval of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
Pricing and Reimbursement 
 In the United States and internationally, sales of any approved products, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Private insurers, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care providers, have implemented cost-cutting and reimbursement initiatives and likely will continue to do so in the future. These include establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that will be offered and the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products. We may need to conduct pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products for formulary coverage and reimbursement. Even with such studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than existing products, and third-party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, in whole or in part. 
 In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we are required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are reimbursed by such entities. It is possible that future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could be enacted to potentially impact reimbursement rates for the products we are developing and may develop in the future and could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates paid to federal and state government entities. Any legislation that impacts these areas could impact, in a significant way, our ability to generate revenues from sales of any approved product that we bring to market. 
 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could significantly affect our future business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Certain legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the ACA have occurred over the past few years. For instance, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the ACA required manufacturer point-of-sale discount from 50% to 70% off the negotiated price for Medicare Part D beneficiaries during their coverage gap period beginning in 2019. Further legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible. We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for any of our product candidates, if approved. 
 
19 

  Sales and Marketing 
 The FDA, in conjunction with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under FDA’s jurisdiction prior to and after approval, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require us to collect additional data or conduct additional nonclinical studies and clinical trials. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. 
 Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician’s belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patient. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. 
 Outside the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon obtaining marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. 
 At such time as we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval, it is possible that our business activities could be subject to scrutiny and enforcement under one or more federal or state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations. These fraud and abuse laws include: 
 

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly or willingly offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any health care items or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and to submit such data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Studies, or CMS, which will then make all of this data publicly available on the CMS website; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analogous state laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states,

 Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by significant criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties also may be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called “responsible corporate officer” doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing. Given the penalties that may be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government was to allege or convict us or our executive officers, employees or consultants of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring similar actions under some of the fraud and abuse laws described above. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and extensive enforcement of them by law enforcement authorities. Further, federal and state laws that require manufacturers to make reports on pricing and marketing information could subject us to penalty provisions. 
 Human Capital 
 As of February 1, 2022, we employed 512 employees all of whom were full-time. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. To successfully commercialize CAPLYTA and develop our drug candidates, we must be able to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We anticipate hiring a number of additional employees during 2022. We continually evaluate the business need and opportunity and balance in-house expertise and capacity with outsourced expertise and capacity. Currently, we outsource substantial clinical trial work to clinical research organizations and drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers. 
 We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Pharmaceutical companies both large and small compete for a limited number qualified applicants to fill specialized positions. To attract qualified applicants, we offer a total rewards package consisting of base salary and cash target bonus, a comprehensive benefit package and equity compensation for every employee. Bonus opportunity and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility. Actual bonus payout is based on performance. 
 Much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels. We believe that our business benefits from the different perspectives a diverse workforce brings, and we pride ourselves on having a strong, inclusive and positive culture based on our shared mission and values.
