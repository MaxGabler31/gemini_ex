ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 Telaria, Inc. provides a fully programmatic software platform for publishers to manage and monetize their video advertising. Our platform is built specifically for digital video and to support the unique requirements of connected TV, mobile and over-the-top content. We provide publishers with real-time analytics, data and decisioning tools to control their video advertising business and offer a holistic monetization solution to optimize yield across a publisher’s entire supply of digital video inventory.
Our technology enables publishers to manage and deliver their directly sold and programmatic video inventory through a single platform, allowing them to get a complete picture of their sales efforts and maximize revenue from ad placements 
across channels. Our platform is connected with leading third-party demand-side platforms, or DSPs, through server-to-server integrations, creating a robust programmatic marketplace where publishers can seamlessly transact with buyers. These programmatic transactions fully automate the sales process and enable publishers to increase the value of their advertising inventory by using data to better segment and match their supply with demand.
In addition, publishers manage video inventory sold by their direct sales teams through our Advanced TV ad server, which was built specifically to meet the unique requirements of connected TV, or CTV, and over-the-top, or OTT, content. Publishers use our integrated ad-server and programmatic supply side platform to optimize yield by having their directly sold campaigns compete against our marketplace of programmatic demand to drive the highest value for their inventory.
We provide a full suite of tools for publishers to control their video advertising business and protect the consumer viewing experience. These controls are particularly important for our clients in CTV and OTT who need to ensure a TV-like viewing and advertising experience for consumers. For instance, our ad-pod feature provides long-form content publishers with a tool analogous to commercial breaks in traditional linear television so that they can request and manage several ads at once from different demand sources. Using this tool, publishers can establish business rules such as competitive separation of advertisers to ensure that competing brand ads do not appear during the same commercial break, audio normalization to control for the volume of an ad relative to content, and frequency capping to avoid exposing viewers to repetitive ad placements.
Publishers on our platform receive up-to-the-second reporting and diagnostics so that they can effectively monitor buying patterns and make real-time changes to take advantage of market dynamics. Our inventory intelligence dashboard provides publishers with extensive analytics that leverage billions of historical data points to drive their monetization strategy, as well as access to first and third-party data that offers valuable insights into their video advertising such as performance, viewability and audience data, which can be used to segment inventory and create incremental value.
We have built long-standing relationships with premium video publishers, in particular in the CTV and OTT space, and we believe the scale and quality of our client base makes us an important partner to video ad buyers. Buyers on our platform include some of the largest brand advertisers in the world and our platform is integrated with the leading video volume buyers in digital advertising. We provide our platform internationally in Europe, Canada, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific regions. We generate revenue when an advertising impression is sold on our platform based on a simple and transparent fee structure established with our publisher partners and do not collect any fees directly from DSPs integrated with our platform.
In September 2017, we changed our name from “Tremor Video, Inc.” to “Telaria, Inc.” In connection with the name change, our NYSE ticker symbol was changed to “TLRA” and our corporate website address was changed to www.telaria.com. Information on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference to this report.
Our Industry
Online video is among the fastest growing advertising formats worldwide. Several factors, including the availability of high-speed broadband and mobile network infrastructure, penetration of internet-connected devices, a proliferation of online content publishers and a behavioral shift towards online and video on demand viewing are driving robust growth in digital video consumption.
Consumers are rapidly shifting their viewing habits towards digital mediums and expect to be able to consume content seamlessly across multiple devices, including computers, tablets, smartphones, and CTVs whenever and wherever they want. The rapid adoption of OTT viewing and CTV has disrupted the traditional linear TV distribution model, as eMarketer estimates 
4

that approximately 33.0 million people in the US have cut-the-cord (i.e., canceled a pay TV service and continue without it) as of the end of 2018, reflecting a 32.8% year-over-year increase. This disruption has created new options for consumers and new economic opportunities for content publishers and advertisers.
The continued growth of online video consumption is resulting in a corresponding increase in the amount of advertising dollars being spent by brands through digital video channels. According to estimates from eMarketer, the U.S. online video advertising market is forecasted to grow to $40.1 billion in 2020, from an estimated $27.8 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 44%. Online video advertising provides a number of advantages over traditional television advertising for both publishers and buyers. For publishers, digital advertising enables content owners to realize the greatest value of their video content by providing tools to maximize advertising yield and manage inventory allocation, while providing advanced real-time reporting and analytics that can inform the sales process. For buyers, online video advertising combines the rich “sight, sound and motion” of television with the advanced optimization, targeting and analytics of digital.
As online video advertising continues to scale and evolve, the need for software solutions that automate the process for planning, buying, selling and measuring video advertising across screens has become more pronounced. As a result, the amount of online video advertising being bought and sold programmatically has increased. Programmatic buying refers to the automated purchase and sale of digital advertising through technology, including the use of real-time bidding technology that allows for the dynamic purchase and sale of advertising inventory on an impression-by-impression basis. We believe that programmatic buying will continue to grow as a percentage of video advertising spend. A report from eMarketer estimates that programmatic digital video ad spending in the US will grow from $22.5 billion in 2018 to $33.6 billion in 2020, a 49% increase. 
Despite the tremendous growth opportunity in the programmatic video advertising, publishers face a number of challenges that require sophisticated technology to solve. Publishers must manage a complex advertising landscape with an increasing number of buyers and technology intermediaries and multiple channels for content consumption for consumers, while protecting the value of their brand and ensuring a high quality end user experience. For instance, publishers must ensure that ads load properly and do not cause delays, are brand safe, match the quality of the premium content that is being viewed, are played at the appropriate volume, and are not overly repetitive. Publishers also need tools to ensure proper management of sales channel and advertiser conflicts, including managing the delivery of their directly sold and programmatic video inventory. These concerns are particularly pronounced for large media companies and broadcasters that are focused on growing their CTV and OTT business. All of these requirements must be executed in real-time and at scale, across multiple channels and devices.
Our Platform
Our software platform features:

• | Leadership in CTV and OTT. We have strategically built our platform to meet the unique requirements of CTV and OTT publishers. Many of these publishers have their roots in linear television and it is important that established business practices in television advertising can be translated to programmatic CTV advertising. For instance, our ad-pod feature provides long-form content publishers with a tool analogous to commercial breaks in traditional linear television, so that they can request and manage several ads at once from different demand sources, in a single ad-pod. Using this tool, publishers can establish business rules such as competitive separation of advertisers to ensure that competing brand advertisements do not appear during the same commercial break and frequency capping to ensure that viewers do not receive repetitive ad placements. 


• | Holistic yield management. Our technology enables publishers to manage and deliver their directly sold and programmatic video inventory through a single platform, allowing them to get a complete picture of their sales efforts and maximize revenue from their ad placements across channels no matter how it is sold. Our integrated ad-server and programmatic supply side platform optimizes yield for a publisher by enabling their directly sold campaigns to compete against our marketplace of programmatic demand to drive the highest value for their inventory. 

5


• | Programmatic supply side platform. Our platform is integrated with the leading DSPs, which enables publishers to seamlessly connect to buyers through our programmatic marketplace. Publishers are able to sell their inventory however they want to transact, including through: open auction, where buyers bid against each other in a real-time auction for the right to purchase a publisher’s inventory; private marketplaces, where select buyers are given the opportunity to bid on a curated set of inventory; or programmatic direct, where a publisher transacts with a specific buyer often at a fixed rate and on a fully guaranteed basis. Programmatic transactions complement a publisher’s direct sales force by enabling them to automate their sales process and improve workflow capabilities to increase productivity. These transactions also create incremental revenue opportunities by enabling buyers and publishers to directly communicate and share data to deliver more valuable targeted advertising. 


• | Advanced brand safety controls. We offer publishers advanced controls to ensure the integrity of their brand and protect the consumer viewing experience. For instance, our creative review tool lets publishers review the specific creative ad unit that is being served to their inventory, including the volume of the ad relative to their content. If the creative ad unit does not align with the publisher’s brand parameters or content guidelines, they can easily block the ad from serving. 


• | Yield optimization tools. We provide publishers with essential tools to manage yield and maximize revenue opportunities, including the ability to define supply hierarchies and demand tiers, minimum price floors, and advertiser and category level black and white lists to manage potential sales channel conflicts. 


• | Real time reporting, analytics and diagnostics. Our platform provides publishers with access to up-to-the-second reporting, which allows them to effectively monitor buying patterns and make real-time changes to take advantage of market dynamics and maximize their yield. We also offer extensive analytics that leverage billions of historical data points derived through our platform to drive long-term monetization strategy for publishers. Our real-time diagnostic tools enable publishers to discover and resolve any revenue impacting issues within seconds, as opposed to waiting days for post-campaign reporting. 


• | Inventory Intelligence. Our inventory intelligence dashboard provides publishers with first and third-party data that offers valuable insights into their inventory such as performance, viewability and audience data. For instance, our recently launched TV Content Reporting tool provides CTV and OTT publishers with granular analytics around the bidding and buying patterns of specific show titles, episodes, content categories. This data can then be used by publishers to segment their advertising inventory so that it becomes more easily discoverable for buyers that are looking to deliver targeted, relevant advertising to consumers. 


• | Out-stream solution. Our proprietary out-stream solution creates additional advertising opportunities for publishers outside of their in-stream video content. This technology automatically launches video advertising in-content on a webpage or application as the user scrolls through an article. For print publishers, this product opens up a new source of advertising revenue that can be seamlessly sold through our platform or their direct sales force. 

Our Competitive Strengths

• | Built exclusively for video. Our platform is focused exclusively on managing and monetizing digital video inventory. Unlike other platforms that were originally built to monetize display advertising, our platform was built from day one to address the special requirements of online video, in particular applications running on mobile or CTV devices. Online video poses a number of unique challenges compared to display such as the ability to dynamically inserts ads into live streams, control for ad volume, ensure ad formats play across devices and best match the viewer’s environment, and accommodate spikes in video consumption around landmark events. Any failure to address these challenges could significantly impair the user experience, which is of utmost importance to premium publishers. 


• | Premium unique inventory. We have expended significant time and resources cultivating and building long-term relationships with premium content providers that offer high-quality unique video inventory, in particular in the OTT and CTV space. This inventory is highly sought after by advertisers looking to capitalize on the shift in video consumption from linear TV to digital and tends to be focused on a smaller number of large scale publishers. Many of our clients have limited experience with programmatic advertising and our subject matter experts often serve in consultative role within a client's organization to help establish best practices and drive their monetization strategy. 

6


• | Scaled programmatic marketplace. We have created a scaled marketplace of programmatic video supply and demand. Buyers on our platform include some of the largest brand advertisers in the world and our platform is connected with all of the leading video demand side platforms through server-to-server integrations that significant reduce latency and response time. 


• | Fully agnostic platform for publishers. We are fully aligned with the interests of our publisher partners. Because we do not offer a buyer solution, we are able to avoid inherent conflicts of interest that exist when serving both the buy- and sell-side. In addition, because we do not own or publish content we are agnostic and have no preference towards delivering demand to any specific publisher. As a result, we are able to build trust with clients, many of whom incorporate their proprietary data into our platform. This trust provides us the benefit of long-term and stable relationships with our clients. 


• | Scalability and continuous innovation. Our platform is built with a flexible architecture and an adaptable data pipeline at its center, so that we can easily expand the platform as well as integrate with ecosystem partners, enabling our clients to use our platform as a full-suite solution to serve all of their needs. Our open architecture allows us to implement rapid product cycles so that we are continuously innovating to enhance our platform for our clients and stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving industry. For example, we believe that we were the first sell-side solution to deliver programmatic ads into live streaming content. 


• | Self-service model. We offer a self-service model that lets publishers direct their own sale and management of video ad inventory without extensive involvement by our personnel. This model allows us to scale efficiently and grow our business at a faster pace than the growth of our sales and support organization. As a result, we are able to achieve a high degree of operating leverage, which positions our business for growing profitability. 


• | Transparent pricing. We generate revenue each time an impression is monetized on our platform based on a simple and transparent fee structure established with our publisher partners and do not collect any fees directly from buyers. This allows publishers to get a true measure of the value of their inventory. 

Clients and Sales
As of December 31, 2018, we had total sales and marketing staff of 103 employees. For 2018, 2017 and 2016 our total sales and marketing expenses were $25.4 million, $28.1 million and $22.3 million, respectively.
Our sales strategy is focused on serving the following core client constituencies: publishers that use our platform to manage and monetize their video inventory and buyers that purchase such inventory, including DSPs that directly purchase inventory on behalf of their clients as well as brand advertiser and advertising agencies who ultimately control and direct advertising spend through DSPs.
Our publisher sales team is responsible for increasing the number of premium publishers using our platform and deepening relationships with our existing clients. Our buyer sales team is responsible for increasing the amount of spend and bidding activity being transacted by buyers on our platform.
Publishers
Publishers own or operate media properties, websites and applications through which video advertisements can be delivered to consumers as they navigate across screens. Publishers use our platform to monetize and manage their video inventory.
We are focused on establishing direct relationships with premium content providers that offer unique, high-quality production and viewing experiences, in particular in the OTT and CTV space. This inventory is highly sought after by brand advertisers looking to capitalize on the shift from linear TV to digital, as it combines a TV-like viewing experience with the significant advantages of online advertising, including the ability to target audiences and measure performance in real-time.
Unlike desktop or mobile video advertising which may come from disparate sources, CTV and OTT inventory tends to be focused on a smaller number of publishers. These publishers, tend to be larger and face a more sophisticated set of challenges compared to other online publishers. Accordingly, the sales cycle can be time and resource intensive. 
Given the limited number of CTV and OTT publishers, we are focused on building deeper, long-term strategic partnerships with these clients through a full-service business development strategy. We have invested significant resources in identifying and cultivating these relationships. Our sales executives and account managers often serve a consultative role within a client’s 
7

sales organization to help establish best practices and evangelize the benefits of programmatic CTV advertising. This team is further supported by our product and engineering team with deep technical expertise, and for larger clients, we may build-out custom features or functionality to help drive deeper adoption of our platform.
Buyers
DSPs are technological intermediaries through which advertisers and agencies transact on our platform. DSPs provide ad delivery and targeting solutions for ad campaigns and purchase video inventory on behalf of advertiser and agency clients. These DSPs are directly connected to our technology through server-to-server integrations and are responsible for bidding on and purchasing advertising inventory on our platform pursuant to master service agreements.
We maintain close relationships with DSPs to maximize the amount of spend being transacted through our platform. For instance, our sales team collaborates with DSPs to create custom private marketplaces that fit specific targeting criteria for a given campaign. Our team of technical account managers continually monitors DSP bidding activities and provides recommendations that inform their trading practices, including insights around bidding behaviors and forecasting tools that assist in media planning.
While the DSP is directly responsible for purchasing advertising inventory, the overall direction of an advertising campaign is typically determined by the advertiser or advertising agency that has engaged the DSP. For certain private marketplace transactions, the specific parameters of a campaign may be negotiated directly with the advertiser or agency without involvement of a DSP. Accordingly, in order to increase the amount of spend transacted on our platform, we also maintain close relationships directly with brand advertisers and agencies. Our brand-focused sales strategy is to target the most “video ready” brand advertisers, including large traditional TV advertising spenders, who are looking to capitalize on the shift in video consumption from linear-TV to online. Our agency sales team is focused on establishing relationships with key decision makers within the largest advertising agencies and agency trading desks.
Technology and Development
We have incurred substantial technology and development expenses developing, maintaining and improving the technology that underlies our platform. We believe that technology innovation is key to our success and we intend to continue to invest in the development of new feature sets and functionalities as well as enhancements to our existing product suite. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 34 employees engaged in technology and development functions. The majority of our technology and development team is located in Mountain View, California and Paris, France.
Competition
We operate in a dynamic and competitive market, influenced by trends in both the overall advertising market as well as the online video advertising industry. The competitive dynamics of our market are unpredictable because our market is in an early stage of development, rapidly evolving, fragmented and subject to potential disruption by new technological innovations. We compete with large internet and media companies that offer video advertising services and sell video advertising inventory as part of a larger solution, as well as advertising technology companies, advertising networks, and supply side platforms that represent publishers. Publishers that use our platform may also use other technology partners to sell their inventory or may sell a significant portion of their inventory through their own sales organizations without use of our platform. Many of our competitors have significant client relationships, much larger financial resources and longer operating histories than we have.
We believe that we compete on the basis of our ability to technologically innovate, the speed, reliability, scale and ease of use of our self-service platform, our ability to bring demand to publishers at scale, the quality of tools that we provide to publishers to manage and monetize their inventory and our real-time reporting and analytics. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors. Other competitive strengths include our video-only focus, first mover advantage in OTT and CTV, independent business model that allows us to fully align with our publisher partners, and our emphasis on transparency in pricing and inventory quality. 
Intellectual Property
Our ability to protect our intellectual property and our technology will be an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property and protect our proprietary technology. We register certain domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We also rely upon common law protection for certain marks. We generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment 
8

agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties, with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. We also use measures designed to control access to our technology and proprietary information. We view our trade secrets and know-how as a significant component of our intellectual property assets, which we believe differentiate us from our competitors.
Our efforts to preserve and protect our intellectual property, may not prevent the misappropriation of such intellectual property or technology, or deter independent development of similar intellectual property or technology by others. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property is difficult. Third-parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain our proprietary technology, or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. Unauthorized disclosure by our employees, contractors or other third-parties could also occur. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate and the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment or loss of our intellectual property, or any inability to enforce our intellectual property rights effectively, could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our technology and intellectual property is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property or technology could make it more expensive for us to do business and could harm our operating results.
Additionally, we expect that products in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement lawsuits as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. From time to time, we may face claims by third-parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights. We cannot assure you that we are not infringing on or violating any third-party intellectual property rights. 
Governmental Regulation; Industry Alliances
We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that are applicable to companies engaged in the online video advertising business. In addition, many areas of law that apply to our business are still evolving and could potentially affect our business to the extent they restrict our business practices or impose a greater risk of liability. 
Privacy and Data Protection
We are subject to or affected by federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as regulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, transfer and security of personal data, such as the use of personal data for online analytics, use of online tracking technologies, or collection of precise geo-location of mobile devices. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Changes to these laws, regulations and guidelines may affect our ability to collect, use, and share personal data, and to provide services to customers that rely upon our ability to leverage data. The use of personal data for digital advertising is a topic of active interest among federal, state, and foreign regulatory bodies. Proposed legislation, regulations and guidelines could, if enacted or implemented, prohibit or limit our ability to use certain technologies that track individuals’ activities online. Evolving global privacy and data protection requirements may create uncertainty in our business, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state, or foreign laws or self-regulatory standards could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. Additionally, if we fail to follow the commitments we make in public privacy notices or applicable self-regulatory security standards we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs
Our solutions reach devices and users throughout the world, including in Australia, North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Our operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy and data security legal frameworks with which we, our customers, or our vendors must comply. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect in May 2018. GDPR introduces strict requirements for processing personal data and increases the compliance burden on us, including by mandating documentation requirements, granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and process information about them. In addition, the GDPR provides for breach reporting requirements, more robust regulatory enforcement and fines of up to 20.0 million euros or up to 4% of annual global revenue. As we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.
Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the Internet, and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and 
9

other external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Any person who circumvents our security measures could steal proprietary or confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our operations. Numerous state, federal and foreign laws and regulations impose requirements regarding the security and protection of personal data, as well as notification to persons whose personal data is affected by a breach. Breaches we may experience could significantly harm our reputation and business and financial results. 
Industry Alliances
Given the developmental stage of video advertising, industry practices are rapidly evolving. We participate in a wide range of Interactive Advertising Bureau committees, councils and working groups, as well as other industry groups that are focused on establishing best practices for the online video advertising industry.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 167 employees, of which 34 were primarily engaged in technology and development functions, 103 were engaged in sales and marketing functions, and 30 were engaged in general and administrative functions. Substantially all of these employees are located in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be favorable.
Facilities
        Our principal office occupies approximately 26,664 square feet of leased office space in New York, New York pursuant to a lease agreement that expires in 2029. We also lease offices in Mountain View, California; San Francisco, California; Los Angeles, California; Melbourne, Australia; Sydney, Australia; London, England; Paris, France; Toronto, Canada; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; São Paulo, Brazil; and Auckland, New Zealand. In addition, we utilize a third-party data center hosting facility located in New York, New York. We believe our facilities are adequate for our current and near-term needs.
