 Industry Overview 
 Background. We provide BSS to the world’s leading communications service providers (“CSPs”). With an unwavering commitment to their success, we help our clients thrive in the most dynamic, challenging, and complex market conditions imaginable, allowing them to:
  
• | Optimize their business, addressing the critical need to reduce operating costs to enable the redeployment of operating capital to support business growth and transformation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enable new revenue streams through the monetization of multiple services, across multiple locations and channels, and bringing new services to market quickly.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Protect and maintain existing revenue streams by improving service delivery that drives higher customer satisfaction and increases retention.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage data and insights to better know and understand their customers and deliver exceptional experiences.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Market Trends of Communications Industry. The global communications industry is going through an unprecedented level of change.  This dramatic disruption is driving the emergence of heightened competition, innovative digital products, compelling customer engagements, real-time operational processes, and intense cost pressures. There are some key trends that are emerging as CSPs try to evolve and compete in this highly complex ecosystem.

• | Consumer choice: Customers have more choices than ever for information, communications, and entertainment services. While the shift in power to the consumer from the service provider has been occurring over the past several years, the adoption of new technologies and services which enable a more ubiquitous and personalized customer experience is becoming mainstream. Service providers – whether traditional or new digital native – are developing offerings that result in a more recurring, loyal, and “branded” customer experience. The “brand” and the “experience” become much more important to these providers as both play a larger role in purchasing decisions. The customer experience, from acquisition to termination of service, will determine the winners and losers in this “always connected” consumer world.

• | Competitive landscape: The proliferation of digital native service providers (e.g., Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google, Amazon, etc.) has changed the competitive landscape forever. This new breed of competitors is not burdened with the infrastructure or legacy operational expenses that traditional CSPs have and, as a result, are more nimble, agile, and competitively priced for consumers. This has forced traditional providers to evaluate the viability of their existing business model in this consumer-driven economy, causing them to evolve their businesses to remain competitive. Scale, breadth of offerings, speed to react, user experience has forced traditional CSPs to evaluate strategies to not only remain competitive, but to survive. Consolidation continues between traditional wireline and wireless providers (e.g., AT&T and DirecTV), traditional CSPs and content providers (e.g., Comcast and NBC Universal) and traditional providers and digital natives (e.g., Verizon and Yahoo). Direct-to-consumer offerings are becoming more prevalent: DisneyLife, Xfinity Stream, Crave TV, and iFlix. And, cooperation not only with new partners, but even competitors (e.g., Netflix and traditional cable operators) is accelerating. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology: Fueled by the collision of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (“IoT”), cloud technologies, and analytics, providers are fundamentally changing the way that they get their products to market and engage with their customers. 5G technologies will fuel the expansion of IoT and sensor enabled services. IoT will underpin the “servicification” of offerings — the transition of routine activities and purchases (e.g., checking gas meters, driving a car, buying groceries, etc.) to on demand services and pervasive consumer relationships (e.g., only servicing meters that show faults, recommending best parking spots, recommending meals for dinner tonight, etc.). In addition, providers are transitioning their legacy technology infrastructure to a combination of private and public cloud technologies to help enhance their speed-to-market, agility, scalability, and cost structure. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New Revenue Sources: Finally, the last trend relates to an increased pressure for CSPs to find new revenue sources, while also managing their cost structure and quality of service delivery during their business transformation. CSPs are seeing a decline in revenues and profits associated with their traditional services like wireline voice and video as a result of new or increased competition. In order to offset these declining revenues and profits, CSPs are looking for ways to improve their cost structure, grow through acquisitions, and launch new, revenue generating services with minimal capital investment. The result is many CSPs are cutting costs associated with their traditional systems, integrating disparate acquired business operations, and launching new digital services with highly-flexible, lower cost solutions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Overall, these market trends drive the demand for scalable, flexible, and cost-efficient BSS and revenue management, customer experience, and digital monetization solutions, which we believe will provide us with revenue opportunities. As a result, we have historically invested a meaningful amount of our revenues in research and development (“R&D”) and have acquired companies that enable us to expand our offerings in a timely and efficient manner. We believe that our scalable, modular, and flexible solutions combined with our rich domain expertise and our ability to effectively migrate clients to our solutions, provide the industry with proven solutions to improve their profitability and consumers’ experiences.  We have specifically architected our solutions to offer service providers a phased, incremental approach to transforming their businesses, thereby reducing the business interruption risk associated with this evolution.
 Business Strategy 
 Our goal is to be the most trusted provider of world-class cloud and software-based solutions to service providers around the globe by helping make our clients’ hardest decisions simpler and smarter, no matter the challenge.  We believe that by successfully executing on this goal we can grow our revenues and earnings, and therefore, create long-term value for our clients, employees, and stockholders. Our strategic focus to accomplish this goal is as follows: 
 Create More Long-Term, Recurring Relationships Within the Communications Industry. Our relentless, relationship-driven, customer-focused business approach is built on a foundation of respect, integrity, and collaboration. As a result, we enjoy long-term relationships with many of the world’s leading CSPs based on a true partnership aimed at helping providers enable sustainable growth, create efficiencies, and deliver differentiated services to their customers. We have seen successful adoption of our managed services approach with global CSPs based upon our compelling value proposition and proven track record.
 Expand Our Product and Services Portfolio Through Continuous Innovation. We believe that our product technology, cloud-based solutions, and pre-integrated suite of solutions give service providers a competitive advantage. Our solutions allow providers to effectively manage their traditional businesses while being able to also quickly deliver new digital services directly to consumers with a modern, personalized, branded experience driving customer satisfaction and loyalty. We continually add new, relevant capabilities to what we do as a company, both in terms of our people and our solutions. By doing this, we build very strong recurring relationships which are difficult for our competitors to displace.

 Description of Business 
 Key Clients. We work with the leading communication providers located around the world. A partial list of those service providers as of December 31, 2017 is included below:
 
 
América Móvil | Hutchinson Whampoa 3G
------------------------------------------+----------------------
AT&T | Liberty 
Bharti Airtel | MTN 
Charter Communications, Inc. (“Charter”) | Telefônica 
JPMorgan Chase | Telstra 
Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) | Verizon

Deutsche Telecom | 

 Clients that represented 10% or more of our revenues for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions, except percentages): 
 
 
 | 2017 | | 2016 
--------+--------+-----+--------------
 | Amount | | % of Revenues | | Amount | | % of Revenues

Charter | | 171 | | 22 | % | | 160 | 21 | %
DISH | | 89 | | 11 | % | | 102 | 13 | %

 See the Significant Client Relationships section of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) for additional information regarding our business relationships with these key clients. 
 Research and Development. Our clients around the world are facing competition from new entrants and at the same time, are deploying new services at a rapid pace and dramatically increasing the complexity of their business operations. Therefore, we continue to make meaningful investments in R&D to ensure that we stay ahead of our clients’ needs and advance our clients’ businesses as well as our own. We recognize these challenges and believe our value proposition is to provide solutions that help our clients ensure that each customer communication is an opportunity to create value and deepen the business relationship. As a result of our R&D efforts, we have broadened our footprint within our client base with many new innovative product offerings. 
 Our total R&D expenses for 2017 and 2016 were $113.2 million and $98.7 million, respectively, or approximately 14% and 13%, respectively, of our total revenues, with the increase reflective of our heightened level of investment in 2017.  In the near term, we anticipate the level of R&D investment activities will be relatively consistent with that of 2017.
 There are certain inherent risks associated with significant technological innovations. Some of these risks are described in this report in our Risk Factors section below. 
 Products and Services. Our products and services help companies with complex transaction-centric business models manage the opportunities and challenges associated with accurately capturing, managing, generating, and optimizing the revenue associated with the immense volumes of customer communications and then manage the intricate nature of those customer relationships.

 Historically, a substantial percentage of our total revenues have been generated from ACP and customer communications management solutions. These products and services are expected to provide a large percentage of our total revenues in the foreseeable future as well. 
 Business Acquisitions. Our strategy includes acquiring assets and businesses which provide the technology and personnel to expedite our product development efforts, provide complementary products and services, increase market share, and/or provide access to new markets and clients. 
 Professional Services. We employ professional services experts globally who bring a wide-ranging expertise – including solution architecture, project management, systems implementation, and business consultancy – to every project. We apply a proven methodology to each of our engagements, leveraging consistent world-class processes, best-practice programs, and systemized templates for all engagements. 
 Sales and Marketing. We organize our sales efforts to clients primarily within our geographically dispersed, dedicated account teams, with senior level account managers who are responsible for new revenues and renewal of existing contracts within a client account. The account teams are supported by sales support personnel who are experienced in the various products and services that we provide. 
 Competition. The market for BSS products and services in the communications industry, as well as in other industries we serve, is highly competitive. We compete with both independent providers and in-house developers of customer management systems. We believe that our most significant competitors in our primary markets are Amdocs Limited and NEC Corporation; network equipment providers such as Ericsson and Huawei; and internally-developed solutions. Some of our actual and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, and technological resources than us and in some instances, we may partner and collaborate with our competitors on large opportunities and projects.

We believe service providers in our industry use the following criteria when selecting a vendor for the mission critical management of their revenue, customer communications, and digital ecosystem: (i) functionality, scalability, flexibility, interoperability, and architecture of the software assets; (ii) the breadth and depth of pre-integrated product solutions; (iii) product quality, client service, and support; (iv) operational excellence and reliability; (v) quality of R&D efforts; and (vi) total cost of ownership. We believe that our products and services allow us to compete effectively in these areas. 
 Proprietary Rights and Licenses 
 We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, and patent laws in the United States (“U.S.”) and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality, and other types of contractual arrangements to establish, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights in our solutions. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or misappropriated. Although we hold a limited number of patents and patent applications on some of our newer solutions, we do not rely upon patents as a primary means of protecting our rights in our intellectual property. In any event, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties. Also, much of our business and many of our solutions rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms. Our failure to adequately establish, maintain, and protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For a description of the risks associated with our intellectual property rights, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors - Failure to Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights or Claims by Others That We Infringe Their Intellectual Property Rights Could Substantially Harm Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 3,373 employees, an increase of 61 employees when compared to the number of employees we had as of December 31, 2016. Our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We are subject to various foreign employment laws and regulations based on the country in which our employees are located. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
