See Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. 
Credit Agreement
On May 23, 2018, the General Partner, as guarantor, and the OP, as borrower, entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement allows for maximum borrowings of $2.9 billion, consisting of a $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and a $900.0 million unsecured term loan facility (the “Credit Facility Term Loan,” together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Credit Facility”). In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, the OP repaid all of the outstanding obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 30, 2014 (as amended, the “2014 Credit Agreement”) and the 2014 Credit Agreement was terminated.
2018 Convertible Notes
The Company’s convertible senior notes due August 1, 2018 (the “2018 Convertible Notes”) matured and the principal outstanding balance of $597.5 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, was repaid with proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility.

Debt Activity
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company’s total debt increased by $14.5 million, from $6.07 billion to $6.09 billion, partially due to the issuance of the 2025 Senior Notes, and net borrowings on the 2014 Credit Agreement and Credit Facility of $218.0 million.

Share Repurchase Programs
On May 12, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock over the subsequent 12 months, as market conditions warranted (the “2017 Share Repurchase Program”).

(“CCA”), our subsidiary that sponsored and managed non-listed real estate investment trusts, and certain of CCA’s subsidiaries, to CCA Acquisition, LLC (the “Cole Purchaser”), an affiliate of CIM Group, LLC for total consideration of approximately $120.0 million in cash.
On February 1, 2018, we entered into a services agreement (the “Services Agreement”) with Cole Capital, pursuant to which we will continue to provide certain services to Cole Capital and its subsidiaries and to Cole Credit Property Trust IV, Inc.

There were no Net Revenue Payments received or earned for 2018.
Primary Investment Focus
We own and actively manage a diversified portfolio of single-tenant retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate assets subject to long-term net leases with creditworthy tenants. Our focus is on single-tenant, net-leased properties that are strategically located and essential to the business operations of the tenant, as well as retail properties that offer necessity and value-oriented products or services. We actively manage the portfolio by considering several metrics including property type, tenant concentration, geography, credit and key economic factors for appropriate balance and diversity. We believe that actively managing our portfolio allows us to attain the best operating results for each asset and the overall portfolio through strategic planning, implementation of these plans and responding proactively to changes and challenges in the marketplace.
Investment Policies
When evaluating prospective investments in or dispositions of real property, our management considers relevant real estate and financial factors, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting the property and business operations of the tenant, the creditworthiness of major tenants, its income-producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors. In this regard, our management will have substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments, subject in certain instances to the approval of the Board of Directors.
As part of our overall portfolio strategy, we seek to lease space and/or acquire properties leased to creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting and operating guidelines. Prior to entering into any transaction, our corporate credit analysis and underwriting professionals conduct a review of a tenant’s credit quality. In addition, we consistently monitor the credit quality of our portfolio by actively reviewing the creditworthiness of certain tenants, focusing primarily on those tenants representing the greatest concentration of our portfolio. This review primarily includes an analysis of the tenant’s financial statements either quarterly, or as frequently as the lease permits. We also consider tenant credit quality when assessing our portfolio for strategic dispositions. When we assess tenant credit quality, we, among other factors that we may deem relevant: (i) review relevant financial information, 
5
including financial ratios, net worth, revenue, cash flows, leverage and liquidity; (ii) evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant’s management team; and (iii) assess the strength/growth of the tenant’s industry. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant’s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental revenue for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. The factors considered in determining the credit risk of our tenants include, but are not limited to: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. We are of the opinion that the credit risk of our portfolio is reduced by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants’ risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants and mitigation options.
Real Estate Investments
As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned 3,994 operating properties comprising 95.0 million square feet of retail and commercial space located in 49 states and Puerto Rico, which includes properties owned through consolidated joint ventures. The rentable space at these properties was 98.8% leased with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 8.9 years. There were no tenants exceeding 10% of our consolidated annualized rental income as of December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, properties located in Texas represented 12.5%, 12.8% and 13.5%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2018, tenants in the casual dining restaurant and manufacturing industries accounted for 12.8% and 10.1%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2017, tenants in the casual dining restaurant and manufacturing industries accounted for 13.8% and 10.1%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2016, tenants in the casual dining restaurant and manufacturing industries accounted for 15.6% and 10.1%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. 
Financing Policies
We rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns. We intend to finance future acquisitions with the most advantageous source of capital available to us at the time of the transaction, which may include a combination of public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities, unsecured corporate-level debt, and other public, private or bank debt. In addition, we may acquire properties in exchange for the issuance of Common Stock or OP Units and we may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. 
We also may obtain secured or unsecured debt to acquire properties, and we expect that our financing sources will include the public debt market, banks and institutional investment firms, including asset managers and life insurance companies. Although we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure, our charter does not contain a specific limitation on the amount of debt we may incur and the Board of Directors may implement or change target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders.
We intend to continue to emphasize unsecured corporate-level or OP-level debt in our financing and to seek to reduce the percentage of our assets which are secured by mortgage loans. For information relating to our Credit Facility, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Competition 
We are subject to competition in the acquisition and disposition of properties and in the leasing of our properties. We compete with a number of developers, owners and operators of retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. We also may face new competitors and, due to our focus on single-tenant properties located throughout the United States, and because many of our competitors are locally or regionally focused, we do not expect to encounter the same competitors in each region of the United States. Our competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments and may succeed in buying the properties that we have targeted for acquisition. Foreign investors may view the U.S. real estate market as being more stable than other international markets and may increase investments in high-quality single-tenant properties, especially in gateway cities. We may also incur costs in connection with unsuccessful acquisitions that we will not be able to recover. 
Regulations
Our investments are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, health, safety and zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all material permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 
6
Our properties are also subject to laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), which require that all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Some of our properties may currently not be in compliance with the ADA. If one or more of the properties in our portfolio is not in compliance with the ADA or any other regulatory requirements, we may be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance.
Environmental Matters 
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current owner of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up contaminated property. Under these laws, courts and government agencies have the authority to impose cleanup responsibility and liability even if the owner did not know of and was not responsible for the contamination. For example, liability can be imposed upon us based on the activities of our tenants or a prior owner. In addition to the cost of the cleanup, environmental contamination on a property may adversely affect the value of the property and our ability to sell, rent or finance the property, and may adversely impact our investment in that property. 
Prior to acquisition of a property, we will obtain Phase I environmental reports, or will rely on recent Phase I environmental reports. These reports will be prepared in accordance with an appropriate level of due diligence based on our standards and generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property’s chain of title and review of historic aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property and nearby or adjoining properties. We may also obtain a Phase II investigation which may include limited subsurface investigations and tests for substances of concern where the results of the Phase I environmental reports or other information indicates possible contamination or where our consultants recommend such procedures. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 180 employees.

Supplemental Federal Income Tax Considerations
This summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice. This discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders of our securities in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances. 
Recent Legislation
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), was enacted. The TCJA made major changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), including a number of provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that affect the taxation of REITs and their stockholders. The long-term effect of the significant changes made by the TCJA remains uncertain, and additional administrative guidance will be required in order to fully evaluate the effect of many provisions. The effect of any technical corrections with respect to the TCJA could have an adverse effect on us or our stockholders or holders of our debt securities.
