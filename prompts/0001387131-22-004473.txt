Disposition of Business Units
 
Sale of Pioneer Critical Power, Inc.
 
On January 22, 2019, Pioneer Critical Power, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“PCPI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company within the T&D Solutions segment, CleanSpark and CleanSpark Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub merged with and into PCPI, with PCPI becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the CleanSpark and the surviving company of the merger (the “Merger”).
 
At the effective date of the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of PCPI, par value $0.01 per share, were converted into the right to receive (i) 175,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“CleanSpark Common Stock”), of CleanSpark, (ii) a five-year warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of CleanSpark Common Stock at an exercise price of $16.00 per share, and (iii) a five-year warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of CleanSpark Common Stock at an exercise price of $20.00 per share. The share quantities and exercise prices of warrants reflect the 10:1 reverse stock split completed by CleanSpark in December 2019.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold all of the CleanSpark Common Stock and warrants to purchase CleanSpark Common Stock it received in connection with the Merger Agreement and recorded proceeds of $2.4 million. The gain from the sale was partially offset by a mark to market adjustment of $1.4 million resulting in a net gain of $968 to other (income) expense in the accompanying statements of operations. Warrants at fair value were previously recorded at inception as long term within other assets.
 
In connection with the Merger Agreement, the Company, CleanSpark and PCPI entered into an Indemnity Agreement (the “Indemnity Agreement”), dated January 22, 2019, pursuant to which the Company agreed to assume the liabilities and obligations related to the claims made by Myers Powers Products, Inc. in the then-pending case titled Myers Power Products, Inc. v. Pioneer Power Solutions, Inc., Pioneer Custom Electrical Products, Corp., et al., Los Angeles County Superior Court Case No. BC606546 (the “Myers Power Case”) as they may relate to PCPI or CleanSpark after the closing of the Merger.
 
In connection with entry into the Merger Agreement, the Company and CleanSpark entered into a Contract Manufacturing Agreement (the “Contract Manufacturing Agreement”), dated as of January 22, 2019, pursuant to which the Company will manufacture paralleling switchgear, automatic transfer switches and related control and circuit protective equipment (collectively, “Products”) exclusively for purchase by CleanSpark. CleanSpark will purchase the Products via purchase orders issued to the Company at any time and from time to time. The price for the Products payable by CleanSpark to the Company will be negotiated on a case by case basis. The Contract Manufacturing Agreement had a term of 18 months and expired during the third quarter of 2020.
 
In connection with entry into the Merger Agreement, the Company and CleanSpark entered into a Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement (the “Non-Compete Agreement”), dated January 22, 2019, pursuant to which the Company agreed not to, among other things, own, manage, operate, finance, control, advise, render services to or guarantee the obligations of any person or entity that engages in or plans to engage in the design, manufacture, distribution and service of paralleling switchgear, automatic transfer switches, and related products (the “Restricted Business”). The Company agreed not to engage in the Restricted Business within any state or county within the United States in which CleanSpark or the surviving company of the Merger conducts such Restricted Business for a period of four (4) years from the date of the Non-Compete Agreement.
 
In addition, the Company also agreed, for a period of four (4) years from the date of the Non-Compete Agreement, not to, among other things, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, induce, or attempt to induce customers, suppliers, licensees, licensors, franchisees, consultants of the Restricted Business as conducted by the Company, CleanSpark or the surviving company to cease doing business with the surviving company or CleanSpark or (ii) solicit, recruit, or encourage any of the surviving company’s or CleanSpark’s employees, or independent contractors to discontinue their employment or engagement with the surviving company or CleanSpark.
 
The Merger resulted in the deconsolidation of PCPI and a gain of $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2019. The fair value of the investment in the CleanSpark Common Stock was determined using quoted market prices, and the fair value of the investment in the warrants was established using a Black Scholes model.

Sale of Transformer Business Units
 
On June 28, 2019, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, Electrogroup Canada, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Electrogroup”), Jefferson Electric, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Jefferson”), JE Mexican Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“JE Mexico,” and together with Electrogroup and Jefferson, the “Disposed Companies”), Nathan Mazurek (Chief Executive Officer of the Company), Pioneer Transformers L.P. (the “US Buyer”) and Pioneer Acquireco ULC (the “Canadian Buyer,” and together with the US Buyer, the “Buyer”). Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to sell (i) all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Electrogroup to the Canadian Buyer and (ii) all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Jefferson and JE Mexico to the US Buyer (the “Equity Transaction”), for a purchase price of $68.0 million. Included in the purchase price, the Company received two subordinated promissory notes, issued by the Buyer, in the aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million and $2.5 million, for a total aggregate principal amount of $7.5 million (the “Seller Notes”). During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company and the Buyer, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, completed the net working capital adjustment, which resulted in the Company paying the Buyer $1.8 million in cash and reducing the principal amount of the $5.0 million Seller Note to $3.2 million. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company recognized an additional reduction to the principal amount of the Seller Note of $194 for a valid claim paid by the Buyer on behalf of the Company. Including the reduction to the principal amount for the valid claim, the Company has revalued the Seller Notes for an appropriate imputed interest rate, resulting in a change to the value of the Seller Notes at December 31, 2021 of $428, for a carrying value of $5.8 million, which is included within notes receivable (see Note 8 - Notes Receivable).
 
The transaction was consummated on August 16, 2019. Pioneer sold to the Buyer all of the assets and liabilities associated with its liquid-filled transformer and dry-type transformer manufacturing businesses within the Company’s T&D Solutions segment. Pioneer Power retained its switchgear manufacturing business within the T&D Solutions segment, as well as all of the operations associated with its Critical Power segment.
 
T&D Solutions Segment
 
We design, manufacture, integrate and sell a wide range of distribution and transmission equipment, including e-Bloc, and our emphasis is to provide custom engineered power solutions, including EV charging solutions, which we estimate currently represents all of our T&D revenue. We believe that demand for our solutions is driven primarily by new installations, customer growth and the global transition to renewable energy.
 
We distinguish ourselves by producing a wide range of engineered-to-order equipment, sold either directly to end users, engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) firms or through electrical distributors. We serve customers in a variety of industries including, but not limited to, utilities, EV charging infrastructure and data center developers and owners, distributed energy resource developers, EPC contractors and renewable energy developers and producers.
 
Our focus has been on expanding the sales of our e-Bloc power solutions, and as a result, in December 2021, we received a $12 million order for use by one of the largest mass merchandisers retailers in the world. This order was secured through one of our distributed energy resource developers and is expected to ship during 2022.

We are actively marketing our preventive maintenance services to new national accounts including: major national retailers, telecommunications companies, data centers, banks, hospitals and health care facilities, educational institutions and property management companies. Additionally, we are actively marketing our recently introduced suite of mobile E-BOOST products, launched in November 2021, and our new and used power generation equipment intended to ensure access to uninterrupted power during times of emergency.
Our Industry
 
The market for T&D equipment and Critical Power solutions is very fragmented due to the range of equipment types, electrical and mechanical properties, technological standards and service parameters required by different categories of end users for their specific applications. Many orders are custom-engineered and tend to be time-sensitive since other critical work is frequently being coordinated around the customer’s electrical equipment installation. The vast majority of North American demand for the types of solutions we provide is satisfied by thousands of producers and service companies in the U.S.
 
We believe several of the key industry trends supporting future growth in our industry are as follows:
 

● | Aging and Overburdened North American Power Grid — The aging and overburdened North American power grid is expected to require significant capital expenditures to upgrade the existing infrastructure over the next several years to maintain adequate levels of reliability and efficiency. Significant capital investment will be required to relieve congestion, meet growing demand, achieve targets for efficiency, emissions and use of renewable sources, and to replace components of the U.S. power grid operating at, near or past their planned service lives. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing Long-Term Demand for Electricity and Reliable Power — The Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration, or EIA, forecasts that total electricity use in the U.S. will increase by approximately 28% from 2011 to 2040. This increase is driven by anticipated population growth, economic expansion, increasing dependence on computing power throughout the economy and the increased use of electrical devices in the home. In order to meet growing demand for electricity in North America, substantial investment in increased electrical grid capacity and efficiency will be required, as well as the addition of specialized equipment to help ensure the reliability and quality of electricity for critical applications. In response to these challenges, there is an increasing trend among commercial and industrial companies to invest in on-site power sources, both for standby purposes in the event of a catastrophic power outage, or to reduce the amount of electricity they draw from the utility grid during peak periods. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rapidly Expanding Electric Vehicle (EV) and Charging Infrastructure Market — A report from Allied Market Research in 2020 projected that the global electric vehicle market will reach $803 billion by the year 2027, registering a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.6%. North America is estimated to reach $194 billion by 2027, at a significant CAGR of 27.5%. In 2010, only about 17,000 electric vehicles were on the world’s roads. By 2019, that number had swelled to 7.2 million and is increasing rapidly according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Furthermore, in order for EV’s to grow at such a rapid pace, it is necessary that infrastructure be built to allow for such growth. In 2019, there were about 7.3 million chargers worldwide compared to an insignificant amount ten years ago, and the EV infrastructure has become a global priority as major governments and corporations have committed to spending billions of dollars towards building EV charging infrastructure. In order to meet the rapidly growing demand for EV’s and the infrastructure supporting it, substantial investment in grid connectivity and enhancement will be required.

Customers
 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, 100% of our sales were to U.S. customers, represented in large part by companies involved in distributed generation, regulated and non-regulated utilities and industrial and wholesale business. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold our electrical equipment and services to over 900 individual customers and our twenty largest customers represented approximately 68% of our consolidated revenue.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, 100% of our sales were to U.S. customers, represented in large part by companies involved in distributed generation, regulated and non-regulated utilities and industrial and wholesale business. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold our electrical equipment and services to over 900 individual customers and our twenty largest customers represented approximately 74% of our consolidated revenue.
 
Approximately 22% and 34% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were made to CleanSpark Inc. The majority of our sales to CleanSpark Inc. were made pursuant to the Contract Manufacturing Agreement that was made in January 2019. As previously reported, on January 22, 2019, we entered into a Contract Manufacturing Agreement, dated as of January 22, 2019 (the “Contract Manufacturing Agreement”), by and among us and CleanSpark. Pursuant to the terms of the Contract Manufacturing Agreement, the Company manufactured parallel switchgears, automatic transfer switches and related products (collectively, “Products”) exclusively for purchase by CleanSpark. The Contract Manufacturing Agreement had a term of 18 months and expired on the 18-month anniversary of the execution of the Contract Manufacturing Agreement. Additionally, approximately 19% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were made to a large international container shipping company in Hawaii.


In connection with the expiry of the Contract Manufacturing Agreement, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with CleanSpark (the “Distribution Agreement”), dated as of May 31, 2021, pursuant to which CleanSpark will serve as our exclusive distributor of the Products within any geographic region in which CleanSpark conducts its business (the “Sales Channel”). We will serve as CleanSpark’s sole source of the Products, and of any similar goods or products that would reasonably be deemed as interchangeable with such Products for sale within the Sales Channel. CleanSpark will purchase the Products via written purchase orders to us. The price for the Products sold under the Distribution Agreement will be determined on a job-by-job basis, provided that CleanSpark shall pay us 97% of the contract sales price of the Products to all end-use customers. The Distribution Agreement terminates on December 31, 2023 and may be extended by mutual agreement of us and CleanSpark.
 
While the loss of a significant number of customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, we do not believe that the loss of any specific customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
 
A substantial portion of the products we offer are sold directly to customers by our marketing and sales personnel operating from our office locations in the U.S. Following the sale of the transformer business units, we no longer have office locations or employees in Canada. Our direct sales force, as well as our authorized manufacturers’ representatives, markets to end users and to third parties, such as OEMs, EPC firms, electrical wholesalers, energy developers and value added integrators.
Sales Backlog
 
Backlog reflects the amount of revenue we expect to realize upon the shipment of customer orders for our products that are not yet complete or for which work has not yet begun. Our sales backlog as of December 31, 2021 was approximately $22.8 million, as compared to $12.7 million as of December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company experienced a surge in orders for its e-Bloc power system of almost $13 million. This was the primary driver of the 80% increase in the Company’s year over year ending backlog. Orders included in our sales backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts that we believe to be firm.
Competition
 
We experience intense competition from a large number of electrical equipment manufacturers and from distributors and servicers of such equipment. The number and size of our competitors varies considerably by product line and service category, with many of our competitors tending to be small, highly specialized or focused on a certain geographic market area or customer. However, several of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources than us, including some of the world’s largest electrical products and industrial equipment manufacturing companies. A representative list of our direct competitors in our T&D Solutions segment includes Crown Electric Engineering and Manufacturing, LLC, Industrial Electric Machinery, LLC, Myers Power Products, Inc. and Powell Industries, Inc.
 
We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of technical support and application expertise, engineering, manufacturing and service capabilities, equipment rating, quality, scheduling and price. In all our businesses, our objective is to focus our efforts on more specialized, challenging and complex applications. Accordingly, a critical element to the success of our business is responsiveness and flexibility in providing custom-engineered solutions to satisfy customer needs. As a result of our long-time presence in the industry, we possess a number of special designs and libraries of programming code for our equipment that were engineered and developed specifically for our customers. We believe these factors give us a competitive advantage and that they are a major contributor to our frequency of repeat customer orders and the longevity of our customer relationships.

Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
The principal raw materials purchased by us are steel, copper, sensors, circuit breakers, meters and relays. We also purchase certain electrical components such as switches, fuses, protectors and circuit breakers from a variety of suppliers. These raw materials and components are available from and supplied by numerous sources at competitive prices. Unanticipated increases in raw material prices or disruptions in supply could increase production costs and adversely affect our profitability. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced an increase in raw material costs as a result of disruptions to our supply chain. These disruptions were initially generated by the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic that had caused many suppliers and sub-suppliers to temporarily reduce or close down excess facilities. The restart of the world economy created initial pressures on the said facilities reaching their pre-pandemic capacity. More recently, geopolitical conflicts have further pressured material costs such as aluminum and nickel. These supply pressures have, and continue to, make it more difficult for us to secure all the material we need in a timely manner in order to meet our obligations and forecasts regarding our customers’ orders. Our largest suppliers during the year ended December 31, 2021 included Industrial Connections & Solutions, LLC, Royal Industrial Solutions, B&B Metals, Inc., Eaton Corporation, and Thyssenkrupp Materials NA.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 91 employees consisting of 31 salaried staff and 60 hourly workers. Certain of our employees located at our manufacturing facility in Santa Fe Springs, California are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Local Union 1710 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO that expires in June 2024.
Environmental
 
We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other areas, air emissions, discharges into waterways and the generation, handling, storing, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. These laws and regulations are constantly changing and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect they may have on us in the future. Like many other industrial enterprises, our manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, which may result in fines, penalties and remediation costs, and there can be no assurance that such costs will be insignificant. To our knowledge, we are in substantial compliance with all federal, state, provincial and local environmental protection provisions, and believe that the future compliance cost should not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position. However, legal and regulatory requirements in these areas have been increasing and there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future due to regulatory noncompliance.
Corporate History
 
We were originally formed in the State of Nevada in 2008. On November 30, 2009, we merged with and into Pioneer Power Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for the sole purpose of changing our state of incorporation from Nevada to Delaware and changing our name to “Pioneer Power Solutions, Inc.” On September 24, 2013, we completed an underwritten public offering and our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “PPSI”.
