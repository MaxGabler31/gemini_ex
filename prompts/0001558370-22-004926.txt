ITEM 1. Business
​
Overview of our Business
Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, Inc. is a leading streaming video-on-demand (VOD) company. We operate Crackle Plus, a portfolio of ad-supported VOD streaming services (AVOD) and free ad-supported television linear channels (FAST), as well as Screen Media, Halcyon Television, the newly formed Chicken Soup for the Soul Television Group, and a number of affiliates that collectively enable us to acquire, produce, co-produce and distribute content, including our original and exclusive content, all in support of our streaming services.
 ​
Crackle Plus is comprised of unique curated streaming services, each delivering popular and original premium content focused on specific themes such as drama, comedy, horror, paranormal, documentaries, and sports. Through our recently launched Chicken Soup for the Soul streaming service, we offer lifestyle, family and kids content. Our Crackle Plus portfolio of streaming services are branded and includes Crackle (among the most watched ad-supported independent VOD streaming services), Chicken Soup for the Soul, Popcornflix, Popcornflix Kids, Truli, Españolflix and FrightPix. As of December 31, 2021, Crackle Plus served more than 40 million monthly active visitors through many distribution platforms including Roku, Amazon Fire, Vizio and others. These visitors viewed content produced through our various television production affiliates, acquired by Screen Media, or licensed from Sony Pictures Television (SPT), Lionsgate, Paramount Global, Fox, Warner Media and more than 100 other production and distribution companies, as well as through our media partners. Crackle Plus networks have access to approximately 14,500 films and 24,000 television episodes of licensed or company-owned original or exclusive programming. The acquisition of 1091 Pictures in March of 2022, added approximately 4,000 films and episodes of licensed content as well as established FAST and AVOD channels in genre specific verticals with approximately 1 billion yearly ad-impressions.

 ​
Screen Media manages one of the industry’s largest independently owned television and film libraries consisting of approximately 20,000 films and television episodes. Screen Media also acquires between approximately 10 and 20 new feature films each year and a few hundred genre titles. Screen Media provides content for the Crackle Plus portfolio and also distributes its library to other exhibitors and third-party networks to generate additional revenue and operating cash flow. Our Halcyon Television subsidiary manages the extensive film and television library we acquired from Sonar Entertainment in 2021. This library is distributed by Screen Media and contains more than 1,000 titles, and 4,000 hours of programming, ranging from classics, including The Little Rascals, Laurel & Hardy and Blondie (produced by Hal Roach Studios), to acclaimed epic event mini-series such as Lonesome Dove and Dinotopia. Our Halcyon library titles have received 446 Emmy Award nominations, 105 Emmy Awards and 15 Golden Globe Awards. In March of 2022, Screen Media acquired 1091 Pictures that provides a diverse library of approximately 4,000 movies and television series. 
 ​
Chicken Soup for the Soul Television Group, which was formed in the fourth quarter of 2021, houses our film and television production activities and produces or co-produces original content for Crackle Plus as well as content for other third-party networks. This group’s production efforts are conducted through a number of affiliates, including Landmark Studio Group, Chicken Soup for the Soul Studios, APLUS.com, the recently acquired Locomotive Global Inc., and Halcyon Studios, which was formed in connection with our acquisition of the assets of Sonar Entertainment. Halcyon Studios develops, produces, finances and distributes high-caliber content for our company for all platforms across a broad spectrum in the U.S. and internationally, including shows such as Hunters (Amazon Prime) and Mysterious Benedict Society (Disney+).
​
Collectively, Screen Media and Chicken Soup for the Soul Television Group enable us to acquire, produce, co-produce and distribute content, including our original and exclusive content, in support of our streaming services. We believe that we are the only independent, AVOD business with the proven capability to acquire, create and distribute original programming, and that we have one of the largest libraries of company-owned and third-party content in the AVOD industry. We believe this differentiation is important as consumers materially shift their viewing habits from network-scheduled viewing to individual, personal on-demand viewing in response to the ever-growing availability of high-speed content delivery across devices.
​
According to industry projections, the U.S. market for AVOD network revenue is expected to increase from $26.6 billion in 2020 to $53.5 billion in 2025. At the same time, advertising spending on traditional linear television networks is expected to decline as more viewers transition from pay television subscriptions to online video viewing. For these reasons, interest in the AVOD business model is increasing, evidenced by traditional linear network operators increasingly seeking to acquire or launch AVOD networks to maintain access to viewers making this transition. We believe AVOD networks will continue to grow rapidly, particularly as consumers seek affordable programming alternatives to multiple SVOD offerings.
​
Since our inception in January 2015, our business has grown rapidly. For the full year 2021, our net revenue was $110.4 million, as compared to the full year 2020 net revenue of $66.4 million. Our 2021 Adjusted EBITDA was approximately, $21.8 million, as compared to 2020 Adjusted EBITDA of $11.8 million. We had net losses of approximately $59.4 million in 2021, as compared to net losses of $44.6 million in 2020. As described below in “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure”, we use Adjusted EBITDA as an important metric for management. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition” and “Item 8. Financial Statements” for more information.
​
Our Strategy
We believe our company is in a differentiated position within the growing and evolving AVOD industry. We identified the trends favoring growth of AVOD streaming services in 2015 and began building our offering in 2017, including the development of our original content production strategy. Since then, we have built a premier ad-supported streaming service that delivers utility and value to viewers and advertisers. We believe our company has the advantage of being unencumbered by the often conflicting strategic choices and priorities faced by diversified media companies that own both legacy linear television networks and VOD streaming services intended to compete with legacy networks. We are singularly focused on building leading VOD streaming services that feature a range of mass-appeal and thematic content,

with a focus on original and exclusive content, and which employ innovative user platforms and data analytics to deliver more personalized viewing experiences and more engaging advertising. We are executing on our strategy in three ways:

● | Content: Cost-effectively grow our production business, our content library asset and our ownership of content rights.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Original & Exclusive programming. Our focus on “originals and exclusives” content, supported by our distribution and production business, is designed to distinguish our network brands among viewers. We are able to add to our existing broad base of content without the significant capital outlay of a traditional television or film studio by producing new originals at low cost through creative partnerships, such as our award-winning 2019 series Going from Broke, which will begin production of its third season in 2022.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Expanding production capacity. We believe we can continue to build an attractive and cost-effective content development pipeline by expanding our production capacity through acquisitions and partnerships. In May 2021, we acquired the assets of Sonar Entertainment and in October 2021, we acquired a majority stake in Locomotive Global, a content development and production services business based in India. We continue to partner with proven industry talent who, we believe, often prefer to work outside of the consolidated major studio industry, where it is increasingly difficult for this talent to control the creative process for and ownership rights in their intellectual property.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Content acquisition and rights ownership. Through Screen Media, we continue to acquire the rights to additional exclusive content. This strategy reduces our reliance on content licensing, which leads to lower costs of revenue and increased gross margin and provide us with wider distribution opportunities to generate additional revenue. When economically attractive, we often, from time to time, choose to sell all or a subset of rights of an individual title in our content library to generate funds to keep our overall investment in content cost effective and maximize returns to our investors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Advertising: Utilize technology and data to deliver innovative advertising formats and relevant ads that engage viewers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Advertiser-desired audience profile. We believe we enjoy strong relationships with leading advertisers based on our demographic reach, our sales approach and our commitment to premium content and innovative, engaging ad formats. Our networks offer advertisers a desirable target audience. The average age of our Crackle viewers is 33, compared to 58 for traditional broadcast networks, and 54 for advertising-supported cable networks. We estimate that 32% of our viewers fall in the 18-34 age demographic.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ​

o | Diverse sales channels. We employ a diverse and targeted advertising sales strategy, using direct, local reseller and programmatic sales channels to provide us with optionality based on market conditions. Most of our advertising revenues are derived from direct sales and local reseller agreements, which we believe give us greater margin contribution and control over our advertising avails than is possible with traditional programmatic advertising. The majority of our programmatic advertising sales are sold by our direct sales force and executed programmatically, providing greater insights and data to our customers, resulting in, higher than normal programmatic CPMs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Technology investment. As we grow our portfolio of streaming services, we are upgrading substantially all of our streaming applications during the first half of 2022 to enhance the user experience, including intuitive navigation, a new video player, seamless ad insertion and a content recommendation engine. These features are just the beginning of achieving our goal of building the best AVOD streaming services. We are also testing new advertising formats and technologies that drive user engagement and offer increased value to advertisers. For example, our “Jumbotron” format engages viewers immediately upon their entry to the Crackle app through video and sound, with premium ad placement on our “Spotlight Channel”. Our “FreeView” format offers viewers who select a title the option to watch one

30 to 60 second advertisement before starting the program, in exchange for an extended advertisement-free experience. “FreeView” has been demonstrated to drive higher user engagement with the placed advertisement and higher brand recall. As we execute on all of these initiatives, we believe we will be positioned to increase both overall advertising sales and ad insertion rates, firmly establishing our AVOD streaming services as a compelling option for advertisers compared to traditional linear broadcast or cable networks.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Viewership: Grow distribution to gain new viewers and employ sophisticated data analytics to deliver more compelling experiences.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Content and Distribution. We exploit our growing libraries of quality content to grow and retain viewers on our streaming services. To augment audience acquisition, we have engaged in distribution arrangements with an increasing number of media platforms including Roku, Amazon Fire, Vizio, Samsung, LG and others, as well as, increased advertising and branding on and off media platforms. In spring 2021, for example, our new distribution partnership with Vizio started featuring a “Crackle button” on a large number of new Vizio television remote controls, which increases consumer awareness of Crackle and guides them directly to our leading AVOD service.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | New Genre-specific Networks. As we grow our content libraries, we are also continuously evaluating opportunities to create new thematic networks that focus on certain genres and types of programming, and we expect these networks to deliver more targeted advertising opportunities to marketers. These efforts are exemplified by our acquisition of 1091 Pictures in March 2022. We are also actively evaluating opportunities to acquire additional AVOD networks that can accelerate our path to even greater scale.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Personalized Viewer Experiences. As we grow viewership, we are creating a large, valuable data base that we use to better understand what our viewers watch and how they engage with advertising. We are increasingly investing in capabilities to manage and analyze our data with the goal of better personalizing viewer experiences and enabling targeted advertising.

Competition
​
We are in a highly competitive business. The market for streaming entertainment is rapidly changing. We face competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, outdoor recreation, video games, the internet and other cultural and computer-related activities. We compete for viewers and programming with companies such as Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, Paramount Plus, Fox, and major film and television studios. We also compete with numerous independent motion picture and television distribution and production companies, television networks, pay television systems and online media platforms for viewers, subscribers, and the services of performing artists, producers and other creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our businesses. 
 ​
In addition, our video content competes for media outlet and audience acceptance with video content produced and distributed by other companies. As a result, the success of any of our video content is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular production, but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing video content available in the marketplace at or near the same time.
 ​
Given such competition, and our stage of development, we emphasize a lower cost structure, risk mitigation, reliance on financial partnerships and innovative financial strategies. We rely on our flexibility and agility as well as the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees, partners and affiliates, in order to provide creative, desirable video content.
​
Intellectual Property
​
We are party to the “CSS License Agreement,” (as defined) through which we have been granted the perpetual, exclusive, worldwide license by CSS to exclusively exhibit, produce and distribute video content using the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand and related content, such as stories published in the Chicken Soup for the Soul books. Chicken Soup for the Soul and related names are trademarks owned by CSS. We have the proprietary rights (including copyrights) in all company-produced content and believe the Brand provides a competitive advantage in attracting advertisers and entertainment talent. As a result of the acquisitions of Screen Media, Crackle, the assets of Sonar Entertainment, 1091 Pictures and the licensing of other libraries we now own copyrights or long-term distribution rights and AVOD rights to approximately 110,000 programming assets totaling over 94,000 programming hours.
 ​
We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, which are described more fully in the section titled “Risk Factors”.
​
Human Capital Management
​
At Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, we aim to bring out the best of our employees and consultants. We are committed to developing our employees and encourage and facilitate the development of our employees through our People Operations department. We depend on a highly educated and skilled workforce. We seek to advance a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment for all employees. Our ability to attract, develop and retain the best talent, is critical for us to execute our strategy and grow our businesses.
​
As of December 31, 2021, we had 151 direct employees. The services of certain personnel, including our chairman and chief executive officer, vice chairman and chief strategy officer, our senior brand advisor and director, and chief financial officer, among others, are provided to us under the Management Services Agreement dated May 12, 2016, between us and CSS (“CSS Management Agreement”). We also utilize consultants in the ordinary course of our business and hire additional personnel on a project-by-project basis. We believe that our employee and labor relations are good, and we are committed to inclusion and strict policies and procedures to maintain a safe work environment. We have taken measures to protect our workforce in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including allowing employees to work from home when possible and implementing safety protocols to support our employees required to work onsite.
