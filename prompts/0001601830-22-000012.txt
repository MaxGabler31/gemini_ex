Overview 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company industrializing drug discovery by decoding biology. Central to our mission is the Recursion Operating System (OS), a platform built across diverse technologies that enables us to map and navigate hundreds of billions of biological and chemical relationships within one of the world’s largest proprietary biological and chemical datasets, the Recursion Data Universe. Scaled ‘wet-lab’ biology and chemistry tools are organized into an iterative loop with ‘dry-lab’ computational tools to rapidly translate map-based hypotheses into validated insights and novel chemistry, unconstrained by published literature or human bias. Our focus on novel technologies spanning target discovery through translation, as well as our ability to rapidly iterate between wet lab and dry lab in-house and at scale, differentiates us from other companies in our space. Further, our balanced team of life scientists and computational and technical experts creates an environment where empirical data, statistical rigor and creative thinking are brought to bear on our decisions. To date, we have leveraged our Recursion OS to enable three value drivers: i) an expansive pipeline of internally-developed programs, including several clinical-stage assets, focused on genetically-driven rare diseases and oncology with significant unmet need and market opportunities in some cases expected to be in excess of $1 billion in annual sales; ii) strategic partnerships with leading biopharma companies to map and navigate intractable areas of biology, including fibrosis with Bayer and neuroscience with Roche and Genentech, to identify novel targets and translate potential new medicines to resource-heavy clinical development overseen by our partners; and iii) Induction Labs, a growth engine created to explore new extensions of the Recursion OS both within and beyond therapeutics. We are a biotechnology company scaling more like a technology company.

The Digital Biology Opportunity
The traditional drug discovery and development process is characterized by substantial financial risks, with increasing and long-term capital outlays for development programs that often fail to reach patients as marketed products. Historically, it has taken over ten years and an average capitalized R&D cost of approximately $2 billion per approved medicine to move a drug discovery project from early discovery to an approved therapeutic. Such productivity outcomes have culminated in an industry success rate of 8% to 14% from discovery to commercialization, respectively, yielding a rapidly declining IRR for the industry, from 10% in 2010 to 2.5% in 2020.1-5

Figure 2. Historical biopharma industry R&D metrics. The primary driver of the cost to discover and develop a new medicine is clinical failure. Less than 4% of drug discovery programs that are initiated result in an approved therapeutic, resulting in a risk-adjusted cost of $1.8 to $2.6 billion per new drug launched.1-51,2,3,4,5
These sobering metrics, despite incredible investment and brilliant scientists, point to the need to evolve a more efficient drug discovery process and explore new tools. Traditional drug discovery relies on basic research discoveries from the scientific community for disease-relevant pathways and targets to interrogate. Coupled with biology’s incredible complexity, this approach has forced the industry to rely on reductionist hypotheses of the critical drivers of complex diseases, which can create a ‘herd mentality’ as multiple parties chase a limited number of therapeutic targets. The situation has been exacerbated by normal human bias (e.g., confirmation bias and sunk-cost fallacy). Accentuating this problem, the sequential nature of current drug discovery activities and the challenges with aggregation and relatability of data across projects, teams and departments lead to frequent replication of work and long timelines to discharge the scientific risk of such hypotheses. Despite decades of accumulated knowledge, the result is that drug discovery has unintentionally become almost artisanal, creating major hurdles for innovation.
Contemporaneously, technological innovations, such as machine learning (ML) have transformed complex industries - from media to transportation to e-commerce - through the creation of scalable and continuously improving iterative cycles of digitization, data aggregation and prediction. The biopharma sector, however, has been slower to embrace such innovations and methods of thinking, except in very narrow areas. We are focused on filling this innovation gap by building a new type of drug discovery engine, the Recursion OS, and reengineering the end-to-end process from the ground up using multiple technological advances that have become accessible within just the past decade.

Figure 3. The standard iterative loop involves 1) profiling of real systems, 2) aggregation and analysis and 3) algorithmic inference, as used by machine-learning native companies across multiple industries6. The details of the real system that is profiled change based on the industry. For example, using satellite and street data along with traffic, construction and weather data to model the real world and predict optimal routes and points of interest along a route or the use of detailed user metrics from media viewing apps to map human preferences and predict and refine new content. Or in the entertainment context, using detailed measurement of viewing preferences to predict the most appealing media types. In these cases, and many others, digital maps of reality create ever-improving predictions that can be tested, leading to both a data moat and ever-improving products.
Our Radical New Approach to Drug Discovery
The emergence of technological innovations has created the opportunity to envision new approaches to discovering therapeutics at scale. We are pioneering the integration of these technological innovations across biology, chemistry, automation, data science and engineering to modernize drug discovery. Combining advances in high content microscopy with arrayed CRISPR genome editing techniques, we can rigorously generate massive, high-dimensional biological and chemical datasets to probe genome-scale biological contexts in multiple human cellular conditions, giving rise to the Recursion Data Universe. Simultaneously, exponential improvements in compute speed and reductions in data storage costs driven by the technology industry, married with ML tools to make sense of complex data, enable us to efficiently harness these massive datasets and perform an unbiased inquiry of causative human biology, unconstrained by presumptive hypotheses. We believe this will enable us to derive novel biological insights previously inaccessible to scientific researchers, reduce the effects of human bias inherent in discovery biology and reduce translational risk at the program outset. For example, given any gene of interest, our platform reveals its relationship to all other genes and molecules included in the Recursion Data Universe, based on proprietary data created in our own automated wet laboratory. Thus we are vastly expanding the scope of surveyable biology and combining novel, basic science and therapeutic discovery into a single step.

Figure 4. The productionized portions of the Recursion OS today. We use our proprietary software and highly-automated wet laboratory to design and execute up to 2.2 million experiments each week across diverse biological and chemical matter. Complex, high-dimensional data from these experiments are generated at a rate of up to 110 terabytes per week and aggregated and analyzed by proprietary neural networks in either distributed cloud computing environments or on our own high-performance compute cluster, BioHive-1. We leverage these algorithms to make predictions about the relationships between untested combinations of biology and chemistry. As of today, we have made more than 200 billion such predictions. Our scientists navigate this vast Map of Biology using proprietary software to discover novel relationships, which we can quickly test either in-house across a variety of assays or via clinical research organizations (CROs). As we validate or refute the predictions in orthogonal assays, up to and including complex animal models, our Recursion OS is continuously improved. This iterative cycle of mapping and navigating is akin to the strategy used by many of the largest technology companies in other complex industries.

Figure 5. Our radically new approach to drug discovery. To date, we have used our approach to generate one of the largest biological and chemical datasets on earth, at nearly 13 petabytes, which is growing by up to 2.2 million experiments’ worth of data each week. In addition, we have built a proprietary suite of software applications within the Recursion OS, making us well-positioned to automate and accelerate basic science and drug discovery tasks and enable scientific teams to quickly and iteratively evaluate therapeutic candidates. Cumulatively, these advances may redefine R&D productivity, as technology has disrupted many other industries, and we believe they will generate forward program growth as they have led to forward revenue growth in the context of technology companies. By applying the Recursion OS to drug discovery, Recursion expects to turn drug discovery from sequential trial-and-error into a search problem where we map and navigate biology in an unbiased manner to discover new insights and translate them into potential new medicines at scale. 
Recursion: A Biotechnology Company Scaling More Like a Technology Company
Traditional approaches to drug discovery typically begin with a specific indication and a human-derived target hypothesis. Bespoke assays are subsequently built, and data is generated to identify therapeutic candidates acting against the proposed target. In contrast, we empirically generate large datasets encompassing a broad range of indications, with data across hundreds of thousands of biological and chemical perturbations. We combine this data within our Recursion Data Universe, with the proprietary suite of advanced computational tools in our Recursion OS to map the relationships among and between all of the possible combinations of perturbations. We then initiate and advance new therapeutic programs by navigating the map to the most exciting predicted relationships. Mutually reinforcing advances in ML algorithms and an ever-growing body of knowledge through continuous data generation create a flywheel of novel insights, increasing the efficiency and output of our pipeline. Further, the time and cost for us to explore a hypothesis are radically less than traditional methods and approaches require, meaning we can explore biology and chemistry much more broadly to find the best relationships for translational research.

(3) Announced a collaboration with Roche and Genentech in December 2021 and received an upfront payment of $150 million in January 2022.
The Recursion OS
Using our highly-automated wet-lab infrastructure, we have executed approximately 115 million experiments across different biological and chemical contexts in multiple human cell types. The resultant Recursion Data Universe, which grows nearly constantly as new experiments are performed, is the substrate by which we use sophisticated computational techniques to Map the underlying biology and chemistry. We apply additional sophisticated computational techniques to these Maps to build our Navigating Tools, which allow us to predict hundreds of billions of biological and chemical relationships in silico and prioritize the most novel and promising candidates for further validation in our wet laboratories. Our mapping and navigating approach to drug discovery means that the ambitious experimental explorations that would have taken us over 1,000 years to execute physically can now be inferred in a matter of months due to the relatability of the dataset that we have already constructed. To date, we have built, validated and deployed our approach with a focus on novel target discovery and validation, which we view as the most challenging step in the drug discovery process due to the bias and limitations of the modern reductionist approach to discovery. We continue to invest in extending our approach into chemistry to enable us to act more rapidly and with higher success rates in translating our novel target discovery work into IND-enabled programs. In the future, we expect that we will further evolve our approach into techniques that improve our ability to execute clinical programs at scale. Though still early, we believe we have demonstrated meaningful leading indicators that our approach industrializes drug discovery, broadening the funnel of potential therapeutic starting points, identifying failures earlier in the research cycle when they are relatively inexpensive and accelerating the delivery of high potential drug candidates to the clinic while reducing cost.

Figure 6. The Recursion OS today, along with a roadmap for future extensions and evolution. In its ideal state, a drug discovery funnel would be shaped like the letter ‘T,’ where a broad universe of possible therapeutics could be narrowed immediately to the best candidate, which would advance through subsequent steps of the process quickly and with no attrition. Our goal is to leverage technology to reshape the typical drug discovery funnel towards its ideal state by rapidly narrowing the funnel. Late-stage clinical failures are the primary driver of costs in today’s pharmaceutical R&D model, due in part to inherent uncertainty in the clinical development and regulatory process. Reducing the rate of costly, late-stage failures and accelerating the timeline from hit to a clinical candidate would create a more sustainable R&D model.
Figure 7. Reshaping the drug discovery funnel. The aim of the Recursion OS is reshaping the traditional pharma pipeline into a more ideal funnel in which the broad swath of biological and chemical data fed into the platform are quickly triaged and fed into an accelerated translation path into the clinic.
We believe we have made progress in reshaping the traditional drug discovery funnel in the following ways:
Table of Contents

•Broaden the funnel of therapeutic starting points. Our flexible and scalable Mapping Tools and Infrastructure enable us to infer hundreds of billions of relationships between disease models and therapeutic candidates, ‘widening the neck’ of the discovery funnel beyond hypothesized and therefore human-biased targets.
•Identify failures earlier when they are relatively inexpensive. Our proprietary Navigation Tools enable us to explore our massive biological and chemical datasets to validate more and varied hypotheses rapidly. While this strategy results in an increase in early stage attrition, we are able to rapidly prioritize programs with a higher likelihood of downstream success. Over time, and as our OS improves, we expect that moving failure earlier in the pipeline will result in an overall lower cost of drug development.
•Accelerate delivery of high-potential drug candidates to the clinic. Additionally, the Recursion OS contains a suite of digital chemistry tools that enable highly efficient exploration of chemical space, including 3D virtual screening as well as translational tools that improve the robustness and utility of in vivo studies. 
We have leveraged our evolving Recursion OS to explore more than 150 disease programs to a depth sufficient to quantify improvements in the time, cost and anticipated likelihoods of program success by discovery stage compared to the traditional drug discovery paradigm. These metrics are leading indicators that, using our approach, we may be able to industrialize drug discovery. We believe that future iterations of the Recursion OS will enable even greater improvements. Ultimately, we look to minimize the total dollar-weighted failure while maximizing the likelihood of success. 
Figure 8. The trajectory of our drug discovery funnel mirrors the ‘ideal’ pharmaceutical drug discovery funnel. We believe that, compared to industry averages, our approach allows us to: i) identify low-viability programs earlier in the research cycle, which quickly narrows the funnel, ii) spend less per program and iii) rapidly advance programs to a validated lead. Data shown are the averages of all our programs from 2017 through 2021. As we continue to evolve and expand our Recursion OS through improvements in chemistry, digital chemistry and predictive ADMET, we believe we will further improve overall R&D productivity.
Over time, we believe continued successes and improvements in any or all of the dimensions highlighted above will improve overall R&D productivity, allowing us to address targeted patient populations that may otherwise not be commercially viable using traditional drug discovery approaches. Further, we believe our unbiased approach may lead to novel targets and allow us to outperform others in highly competitive disease areas where multiple parties often simultaneously pursue a limited number of similar target hypotheses. These advantages potentially significantly expand the total addressable market for our technology. However, the process of clinical development is inherently uncertain, and there can be no guarantee that we will achieve shorter development timelines with future product candidates.
Our Business Strategy
Table of Contents

Figure 9. We harness the value and scale of our maps of biology using a capital efficient business strategy. Our business strategy is segmented into our: i) internal pipeline focused on oncology, rare diseases and other capital efficient opportunities, ii) enterprise-scale discovery partnership agreements in large therapeutic areas such as fibrosis with Bayer and neuroscience with Roche and Genentech and iii) Induction Labs which is our growth engine for translating our platform into auxiliary business opportunities over a longer-term horizon (not depicted above). 
Our business strategy is to build, explore and develop opportunities that we feel we are most uniquely suited to advance. While most biopharma companies are focused on a narrow slice of biology or therapeutic area, where they believe they have an advantage or insight, our vision is to decode biology by mapping and navigating broad and diverse datasets so that we can, over time, evolve and extend our Recursion OS to deliver valuable and translatable insights at scale and across many therapeutic areas and modalities. Success in this endeavor would create extraordinary value and impact. Today, the biopharma industry has a market capitalization of multiple trillions of dollars, and creates products that touch nearly every human in the world at some point in time. Yet, on average, products developed in our industry fail in clinical development 90% of the time. This industry-wide inefficiency means continued investment in refining our Recursion OS to improve the probability of success of our programs over time is by far the most valuable long-term driver of our success, and it is also what we are most uniquely positioned to deliver.
Delivery of subsequent iterations of the Recursion OS, however, requires that we make tangible demonstrations of progress and potential along the way. As such, we developed a multi-pronged, capital efficient business model focused on three key value-drivers that enable us to demonstrate our progress over time while continuing to invest in the development of the Recursion OS, which we are convinced is our most compelling long-term value driver.
Value-Driver 1 - Near-Term Wholly Owned, Capital Efficient Programs
We believe that the primary currency of any biotechnology company today is clinical-stage, wholly-owned assets. These programs can be concretely valued using a variety of models by key stakeholders in the biopharma ecosystem and present the potential to meet critical patient needs. Further, for Recursion, these assets have a variety of additional benefits, including: a) validation of key elements of the Recursion OS; b) growing our expertise in clinical development; and c) building in-house processes to interact with regulatory agencies and advance medicines towards the market. This last point is perhaps the most important for Recursion. If the Recursion OS evolves in the manner we have designed it to, it will improve with more iterations such that future programs could be more valuable than today’s programs. In this way, operating as a vertically-integrated biopharma company that leverages technology at every step from target discovery through clinical development (and even marketing and distribution) may be the long-term business model with the most upside for our stakeholders, including both investors and patients. Thus, the importance of our early cycles of learning and iteration in clinical development 
Table of Contents

have long-term value that may exceed the near-term commercial opportunities of any of the indications we have chosen to explore. For these reasons, we have directed our internal programs in areas that are both diverse and capital-efficient. Moreover, we may be opportunistic about selling or licensing assets after they achieve key value-inflection milestones so that we can re-invest in our long-term strategy.
Value-Driver 2 - Intermediate Term Partnered Programs
We believe that in its current form, our Recursion OS is already capable of delivering many more therapeutic insights than we would be able to responsibly shepherd alone today. As such, we have chosen to partner with experienced, top-tier biopharma companies to explore intractable and resource-intensive areas of biology like fibrosis with Bayer and neuroscience with Roche and Genentech. The key advantages of these partnerships are that: i) we are able to deploy the Recursion OS to turn latent value into tangible value in areas of biology where it would be challenging for us to do so alone; ii) the clinical development paths for these large therapeutic areas are often resource-intensive and highly complex; and iii) we are able to learn from our colleagues at these top-tier companies such that it could give us a competitive advantage in the industry over the longer term. This strategy also embeds us in the discovery process of large pharmaceutical companies, and gives rise to an alternative long-term business model whereby we become a valued partner of many such companies, focusing on discovery and de-risking of broad and varied programs while relying on our partners to develop and market the medicines while we take an increasingly large portion of the upside. Based on how value is ascribed across our industry today, this model alone is not yet feasible to maximize our business impact. However, we feel that shifts in industry perception and improving economics associated with each partnership agreement that we sign suggest that there is some potential for this portion of our business model to become the most value-accretive over the long-term.
Value-Driver 3 - Induction Labs for Long-Term Value Impact
Mapping and navigating biology has extraordinary potential to create better medicines faster and at lower costs. This is our primary focus today and is likely to be the most impactful use of our Recursion OS. However, there may be tangential markets and opportunities in spaces like diagnostics for which the infrastructure and technology we have built could create compelling value, impact and operating synergies. We will continue to make very small exploratory investments to test the utility of our platform to create new value-drivers for Recursion over the longer term.
Our Programs
Every program at Recursion is a product of our Recursion OS. All of the programs in our internal pipeline are built on unique biological insights surfaced through the Recursion OS and target diseases where: i) the disease-causing biology is well defined, but the downstream effects of the disease-cause are typically poorly understood or where the primary targets are typically considered undruggable and ii) there is a high unmet medical need, there are no approved therapies or there are significant limitations to existing treatments. Several of our internal pipeline programs target indications with market opportunities expected to be near to or in excess of $1.0 billion in annual sales and we are preparing for three programs to enter Phase 2 or Phase 2/3 clinical trials within the first three quarters of 2022 and a fourth program to enter a Phase 1 clinical trial within the second half of 2022.

Figure 10. Examples of current Recursion programs falling into our First, Second and Next Generation paradigms. The earliest iterations of the Recursion OS leveraged brute-force search (where small molecules were tested directly in the context of each disease model we built) and used a small molecule library restricted primarily to known chemical entities. Programs arising from this iteration of the Recursion OS are deemed First Generation Programs. As we developed our chemistry capabilities and new chemical entity library at Recursion, Second Generation Programs arose, though the throughput needed to screen large libraries of new chemical entities presents a powerful but relatively inefficient solution. Today, most of our new programs, as well as new partnerships or expansions of prior partnerships, are Next Generation Programs, whereby we use our maps of biology to navigate to novel or unexpected relationships between molecules (known or new chemical entities) and then validate those predictions in our wet labs.

◦REC-64151 and derivatives or functionally related series for the treatment of immune checkpoint resistance in KRAS/STK11 mutant non-small cell lung cancer
◦Potential future programs in fibrosis with Bayer or in neuroscience or a single oncology indication with Roche and Genentech
In addition to the programs highlighted above, we are actively developing dozens of additional programs which may prove to be drivers of our future growth. As we have significantly expanded our chemistry capabilities in the last year and continue to invest deeply in these key elements of the Recursion OS, moving forward we expect that the vast majority of our new programs will be part of our Next Generation of potential programs discovered using our tools for mapping and navigating biology. We believe that the number of potential programs we can generate with our Recursion OS is key to the future of our company, as a greater volume of validated programs has a higher likelihood of creating value. The speed at which our OS generates a large number of product candidates is important, since traditional drug development often takes a decade or more. In addition, we believe that our large number of potential programs makes us an attractive partner for larger pharmaceutical companies. The static or declining level of R&D output at many large companies means that they have an ongoing need for new projects to fill their pipelines.

Our People
While we operate at the intersection of cutting-edge science and technology from multiple disciplines, our people are the glue that holds us together and are the most important part of our company. Unlike traditional biotechnology companies, our rapidly growing team of approximately 400 Recursionauts is balanced between life scientists such as chemists and biologists (approximately 40% of employees) and computational and technical experts such as data scientists and software engineers (approximately 35% of employees), creating an environment where empirical data, statistical rigor and creative thinking is brought to bear on the problems we address. While we are united in a common mission, Decoding Biology to Radically Improve Lives, our greatest strength lies in our differences: expertise, gender, race, disciplines, experience and perspectives. Deliberately building and cultivating this culture is critical to achieving our audacious goals. Read more about how we invest in and motivate our people to achieve our mission in Recursion’s first Environmental, Social and Governance Report, released simultaneously with this annual report.
The Recursion OS - In Depth
The Recursion OS is an integrated, multi-faceted system for iteratively mapping and navigating massive biological and chemical datasets to industrialize drug discovery. It consists of three parts:
•Mapping Tools and Infrastructure: A synchronized network of highly scalable enabling hardware and software used to design and execute diverse biological experiments and subsequently store our ever-growing datasets. One of the cornerstones of this layer is our state-of-the-art ML supercomputer, BioHive-1, which we believe is one of the most powerful supercomputers wholly owned by any single biopharma 
Table of Contents

company for drug discovery applications and within the top 100 most powerful supercomputers across any industry.
•The Recursion Data Universe: As of December 31, 2021, our Recursion Data Universe contained nearly 13 petabytes of highly relatable biological and chemical data spanning phenomics, orthogonomics, InVivomics and bespoke bioassay data. 
•Navigating Tools: A suite of in-house software tools, algorithms and machine learning approaches designed to explore data from the Recursion Data Universe and translate it into actionable insights for our research and development teams.
The combination of wet-lab biology and dry-lab computational tools are organized in an iterative loop to rapidly translate map-based hypotheses into validated insights and novel chemistry, unconstrained by published literature or human bias. While many in the industry have focused on point-solutions and digital chemistry tools, our focus on novel technologies spanning target discovery through translation as well as our ability to rapidly iterate between wet lab and dry lab differentiates us from other companies. More importantly, our repetition of wet-lab validation and in silico predictions creates a flywheel effect, where data generation and learning accelerate side-by-side and further strengthen our drug discovery platform. While emerging competitors and large, well-resourced incumbents may pursue a similar strategy, we have two advantages as a first mover: i) no amount of resources can compress the time it takes to observe naturally occurring biological processes, and ii) the ever-growing Recursion Data Universe creates compounding network effects that may make it difficult for others to close the competitive gap.
Figure 12: The Recursion OS for industrializing drug discovery. The Recursion OS is an integrated, multi-faceted system for iteratively mapping and navigating massive biological and chemical datasets to industrialize drug discovery. It is composed of: (i) Mapping Tools and Infrastructure, (ii) the Recursion Data Universe, which houses

our diverse and expansive datasets and (iii) Navigating Tools, a suite of our proprietary discovery, design and development tools.
Mapping Tools and Infrastructure
Figure 13. Our Mapping Tools and Infrastructure generate our proprietary data. This layer is the backbone upon which the Recursion OS operates and comprises diverse and highly advanced enabling hardware and software systems working in concert.
The foundational layer of the Recursion OS is a highly-synchronized network of enabling hardware and software used to design, execute, aggregate and store the nearly 13 petabytes of rapidly growing, biological and chemical data. Discrete components of this layer include the following:
Biological Tools
We deliberately designed our platform to model a wide range of biology spanning multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology, immunology, neuroscience, cardiovascular, metabolic and infectious diseases using the same, image-based endpoint and core technology stack. Our modular design enables us to systematically expand our search space into new areas of exploration while minimizing the need for bespoke assay development. In subsequent steps of our process, our modular design and consistent protocol enable us to analyze and compare the resulting data across these modules, revealing the interconnectedness of human biology and tractable therapeutic starting points. Modules that comprise our biological tool suite include:
•Genetics Module: A set of proprietary protocols and whole-genome arrayed guide RNA library using CRISPR gene editing approaches to model gene deficiency of every gene in the human genome in an arrayed and high-throughput format, plus BacMam capabilities to model gain-of-function.
•Soluble Factor Module: Proprietary protocols using single soluble factors such as cytokines and chemokines, or combinations thereof, to model a broad range of immune-related and complex diseases.
Table of Contents

•Infectious Disease Module: Proprietary protocols using diverse biological pathogens driving a broad range of infectious diseases as well as agents involved in the innate immune response (e.g., LPS, cyclic dinucleotides, etc.).
•Fibrosis Module: Proprietary models and protocols developed in partnership with Bayer to study fibrotic diseases, including cell co-culture systems. 
•Neural Module: Proprietary models and protocols developed in partnership with Roche and Genentech to study neuroscience diseases, including advanced genetic engineering methods and iPSC-derived human relevant models.
•Complex Multicellular Disease Tools: Advanced co-culture models to explore multifactorial diseases where cell-cell crosstalk is a critical driver of the disease states. These approaches are particularly relevant in immunology, where regulation between adaptive immune cells (i.e., T cells, B cells) and innate immune cells (i.e., monocytes, macrophages) is critical to understanding the full breadth of immunological responses.
•Patient-Derived Tools: Techniques to improve the translatability and speed at which we validate and translate early discoveries. We are actively sourcing patient cells (nearly 400 individual lines across more than 65 diseases sourced to date), reprogramming them to induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, and banking the resulting lines so that we can rapidly differentiate these cells into multiple tissue-specific states for downstream validation when needed.
We continue to build out additional biology tools and modules to further expand our search space, while maintaining a common, image-based endpoint to reduce complexity, increase flexibility and ensure the relatability of our ever-growing Data Universe. Over time, we plan to introduce additional variables such as variable imaging time points, 3D models and tissue-specific organoids that move our screens ever closer to human systems biology.
Chemistry Tools
Our in-house chemistry tools include physical compound collections, state-of-the-art compound storage and handling infrastructure, and high-precision analytical equipment. Our experienced team of chemists use this equipment, and a network of reputable CROs, to advance discovery efforts and deliver differentiated drug candidates.
We have access in-house to nearly one million small molecule starting points from a combination of commercial, semi-proprietary and proprietary sources and use this library to identify new chemical starting points for small molecule discovery campaigns. Approximately 500,000 of these compounds reside within the Recursion NCE library, curated by our medicinal chemists and designed for highly druggable chemical properties while avoiding undesirable chemical properties, such as poor solubility and permeability. While this library has been constructed to maximize chemical diversity, we have ensured that several analogs of many compound cores are included to help identify emergent structure activity relationships for early hits and enable rapid hit expansion into readily available analogs. Additionally, we have curated a selection of approximately 7,500 preclinical and clinical-stage compounds from public forums or filings, covering approximately 1,000 unique mechanisms, for which an abundance of existing data and annotations currently exist. Such molecules are frequently used as tools within our work and may be advanced as therapeutic programs if our maps reveal unique and previously undisclosed biological activity. Approximately another 500,000 compounds are from Bayer’s NCE library, for which we do not have structural information.
We plan to substantially increase the size and diversity of our NCE library over the coming years through a combination of partnerships and investments that are being made in our Closed Loop Automated Synthesis Suite (CLASS) which will eventually integrate sample management, synthesis and purification and in vitro ADMET and bioanalytical testing. We believe we have the potential in the next 3-5 years to meet or surpass the scale of large pharmaceutical company libraries that typically have between approximately 1.4 and 4 million compounds. Our next generation of wet-lab has been designed with the theoretical potential to store more than 60 million compounds onsite.

Figure 14. Our internal chemical libraries are highly diverse. This visualization of the structural diversity of approximately 200,000 compounds from one of our small molecule NCE libraries, where compounds are clustered based on descriptors using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, demonstrates the evenly distributed and diverse nature of our compounds. This diversity increases the probability that we capture useful biochemical interactions across a broad range of biology.
Mass Compound Storage & Handling. We have invested in a sophisticated compound management infrastructure that allows for the environmentally controlled (temperature and humidity) storage of over one million compounds in tubes and plates. Our system enables rapid creation of purpose-built and custom libraries from our existing compound inventory. In addition, automated pipetting systems are in place to consistently aliquot and dilute these compounds into a variety of configurations for experimentation. All key events and lab data are tracked in our laboratory information management software, which integrates with experiment design and scheduling software, enabling accurate and seamless information tracking for our experiments.
Medicinal Chemistry/CMC Outsourcing. Our internal team of experienced medicinal chemists execute all drug design activities in-house but outsource drug synthesis and select ADMET assays to a network of reputable contract research organizations (CROs) with whom we have built well-established relationships. This may change with the build out of our CLASS system in the coming years. However, today external CROs provide easily scalable and project-specific resource flexibility, access to diverse chemistry expertise and rapid turnaround as we iterate on SAR. As programs advance into more advanced preclinical stages where synthesis at scale is of higher priority, our medicinal chemists work ever-closer with our CROs and internal chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) group to craft detailed material plans for preclinical, IND-enabling and clinical supplies. We are also investing in the design and build out of a manufacturing facility that will enable us to synthesize and scale drug substance manufacture to support preclinical animal studies and early human clinical trials. 
Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry. We have built an analytical laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry equipment. Our lab performs analytical work to assess compound purity and identification for quality controls, bioanalytical work measuring compound levels in plasma and tissue samples from in vivo ADME and efficacy studies and plasma protein binding and permeability studies. Furthermore, this team carries out biomarker identification and validation activities in support of preclinical and clinical translational efforts. Further, we are investing in the design and build out of our Closed Loop Automated Synthesis Suite (CLASS). As currently designed, this suite will eventually integrate, both physically and virtually, sample management, synthesis and purification and in vitro ADMET and bioanalytical testing. The suite will be built on our digitalization, analytics

and informatics capabilities to create an integrated computational platform with visualization tools, in-silico predictive models and retrosynthetic intelligence when fully mature. This suite will allow us to industrialize the synthesis of small molecules and subsequent data generation at scale
Cell Culture
We have built a state-of-the-art cell culture facility to consistently produce high-quality, mammalian cells, such as vein, kidney, lung, liver, skin and blood cell subsets, that go into each experiment run on our platform and in subsequent validation. We utilize a toolbox of in vitro cell culture techniques to scale production while driving down costs. This includes the graduated use of small scale flasks, with a 25 cm2 growth surface area, to large-scale, single-use bioreactors, with a combined 575,000 cm2 growth surface area that enables us to generate 25 billion human cells, enough for up to 8,000, 1536-well plates for screening. 
We have on-boarded innovations including large scale, microcarrier-based, suspension culture systems to reduce footprint and increase growth surface for additional scale. Additionally, our cell culture facility is now fully equipped to perform work using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines, including: (i) CRISPR genome editing technologies to generate knock-out or knock-in lines (ii) differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells at large scale and (iii) increased cryostorage capacity for pluripotent cell lines and differentiated cell products. We will continue to onboard additional cutting-edge innovations to scale our work further.
Table 2. Numerous and diverse cell types onboarded to our platform enable us to broadly interrogate biology. Approximately 40 human cell types have been onboarded to our high-throughput discovery systems to date, spanning primary cells, cell lines and cells derived from iPSCs.
We maintain a strong track record of quality and consistency in our cell culture facility by implementing facility design and control systems that are uncommon among technology-enabled drug discovery companies. These designs and controls include rigorous process validation and documentation, a personnel training and qualification program, and routine quality monitoring. Our quality system is designed such that we routinely monitor our performance to identify and implement the appropriate preventive and continuous improvement actions.
Lab Robotics
We have assembled and synchronized robotic components, such as liquid dispensers, plate washers and incubation stations, that enable us to efficiently execute up to 2.2 million experiments per week with only a small 
Table of Contents

team overseeing the process at any given time. These robotic systems are modular by design and easily configurable to allow us to create complex and variable workflows. This flexibility is essential for executing experiments using our diverse biological tools (e.g., genetic and soluble factors) and chemical libraries at scale and with high quality.
We ensure our lab generates consistent, accurate and precise data through the use of multiple systems: facility controls to prevent contamination of cells, rigorous assay validation and instrument qualification to ensure consistency, and routine quality monitoring to capture data automatically and track all critical experiment specifications. Our quality system is designed such that we routinely monitor our performance to identify and implement the appropriate preventive and continuous improvement actions. 
Figure 15. Our high-throughput automation platform looks more like a sophisticated manufacturing facility than a biology R&D laboratory. Our platform can execute up to 2.2 million experiments each week with high-quality to enable downstream analyses.
Figure 16. The automated workflow used to generate our large-scale, image-based dataset. A core dataset in the Recursion Data Universe is based on over one billion labeled images of human cells generated across millions of unique perturbations (i.e., gene knockout, soluble protein factor addition, drug addition or combinations thereof) generated in our own wet laboratories.
Table of Contents

Our laboratory operates approximately 50 weeks each year. Since 2017, we have at least doubled our throughput every year while meeting our quality benchmarks. We have achieved this level of operational excellence by integrating state-of-the-art technology and adopting lean manufacturing principles. Our move to mapping and navigating biology using inference, and away from brute-force screening, has relieved some of the demand for exponential scaling of our platform moving forward.
Figure 17. The experimental throughput of our high-dimensional phenomics assay has scaled significantly over time. The capabilities of our phenomics assay have grown throughout 2021 with quick recovery following a COVID-19-induced, full-office closure in early 2020.
Data Capture
The Recursion Data Universe contains nearly 13 petabytes of highly relatable biological and chemical data spanning multiple different “omic” modalities. We have invested in state-of-the-art equipment to capture this data at scale and processes to ensure that the highest quality data are fed into the Recursion Data Universe.
High-Throughput Microscopy. Central to the Recursion Data Universe is our image-based dataset. As of December 2021, we operate 20 ImageExpress microscopes in our labs, which we believe to be the greatest single number of such systems in a single facility anywhere. These microscopes run nearly continuously, capturing over 155,000 fluorescent microscopy images every hour across six imaging channels. Alerts are automatically triggered if quality issues are detected, enabling our teams to quickly reimage our experimental conditions to obtain higher quality data. Upon imaging, our digital data pipeline immediately uploads these images to the cloud where they are processed within seconds. On a weekly basis, our pipeline captures, uploads and processes up to 110 terabytes of imaging data to add to the Recursion Data Universe.
High-Throughput Sequencing. Our high-throughput sequencing system enables us to profile transcriptomic measurements in house for any cell type and biological perturbations we develop. As of December 2021, this system includes two Illumina NovaSeq 6000 production scale sequencers. These sequencers currently process 6,100 individual transcriptome samples per week in development operations, and we anticipate a full production capacity of 44,000 transcriptomes a week in the future. Additionally, we have installed a 10x Chromium X instrument capable of performing single cell RNAseq workflows and are currently in the process of validating this assay. The addition of the single cell RNAseq platform will allow us an additional level of granularity in assessing transcriptional changes not capable with other transcriptomic methods. 
In Vivo Data Collection. We use our proprietary cage hardware and continuous, high-resolution video systems to collect InVivomics data at scale. In 2021, we had 19 cage systems operational, actively surveying a total of 931 possible simultaneous in vivo subjects undergoing pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety studies of our drug candidates, as well as R&D studies to unlock future predictive assays. This data is uploaded to the cloud where it is

automatically analyzed. Readouts are provided back to our scientists and integrated into our Recursion Data Universe.
Figure 18. Our proprietary, scalable Smart Housing System for in vivo studies automatically collects and analyzes video and sensor data from all cages continuously.
Additional Data Collection Systems. Beyond phenomics, orthogonomics and InVivomics, we continuously capture experimental data from bespoke assays as we validate our discovery programs. Example data capture infrastructure includes multiplexed readouts for biological analytes, flow cytometry and electric cell-substrate impedance testing. As this data is generated, it is included in our data warehousing system that connects one-off experimental assays with the rest of the Recursion Data Universe.
Technology Stack
The Recursion OS is built on top of a core technology stack that is highly scalable and flexible. We have adopted a ‘hybrid-cloud’ strategy, leveraging the benefits of both public and private cloud infrastructure depending on the context and our needs:
•Public Cloud. The public cloud is our default choice for production workloads and applications. The scale, elasticity of compute and storage and economies of scale offered by public cloud computing providers enable us to cost-effectively execute our strategy.
•Private Cloud. The private cloud, or edge computing, is used to integrate our lab data flows, including the upload of data to the public cloud.
•BioHive-1 and High Performance Computing in a Private Cloud. In December 2020, we made a significant investment to expand our computing power, purchasing a world-class supercomputer named BioHive-1. BioHive-1 is built on NVIDIA’s DGX SuperPod architecture and ranked 97th on the most recent TOP500 list of the world’s most powerful supercomputers as of November 2021. This new computing power allows us to iterate on new neural network architectures faster and more efficiently, accelerating our deep learning models and empowering our growing workforce of ML experts. Deep learning projects that took a week to run on our previous cluster can run in under a day on the new cluster.
Table of Contents

Figure 19. We believe BioHive-1 is one of the most powerful supercomputers dedicated wholly to drug discovery for a single company. BioHive-1 consists of 40 NVIDIA DGX A100 640GB nodes which further expands our capability to rapidly improve ML models.
Enabling Software Tools
Alongside our infrastructure, we have built a suite of tools that empower our scientists to accurately design, execute and verify the quality of up to 2.2 million diverse experiments each week, spanning phenomic, orthogonomic and ADMET assays. Our tools, which take into account real-time onsite reagent supplies, enable consistent control strategies and design standards that make each week’s data relatable across time. Additionally, these tools automatically flag experiments or processes which miss quality requirements or stall at some point in the process and notify the appropriate Recursionaut, providing them the tooling needed for manual intervention. Elements of our Enabling Software Tool suite include:
•Experiment Design Tools: Proprietary Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to track reagent inventory and flexibly select compounds from our library, custom applications used to design large experimental layouts consisting of millions of perturbation conditions with appropriate randomization and control strategies, and proprietary algorithms for designing CRISPR gene editing guide RNAs for maximal knockout efficiency
•Experiment Execution and QC Tools: Suite of tools and dashboards to automatically execute and continuously monitor experimental protocols to ensure reliable experiment execution and custom web applications that enable our scientists to view and interact with microscopy images and associated meta-data from our phenomics platform for systematic QC at both the image- and plate-level.

Experiment Delight is our internal experiment design tool used to rapidly create large-scale experiment sets with high flexibility, while integrating our proprietary rules for experiment layout learned over approximately a decade of iterative improvement. The graphical interface facilitates experiment plate layout specification.
The Recursion Data Universe
Table of Contents

Figure 21. The Recursion Data Universe is at the core of the Recursion OS. The central asset of the Recursion OS is the Recursion Data Universe, encompassing multiple data types that compound together, the whole providing greater insight than the sum of the parts.
The Recursion Data Universe comprises nearly 13 petabytes of highly relatable biological and chemical data, including: phenomics, orthogonomics, ADMET assays, InVivomics and bespoke bioassay data. These different data modalities are highly complementary as we advance drug discovery and development programs. Phenomic data provides a broad, foundational layer of biological and chemical data, while other datasets provide greater translational insights. The size of the Recursion Data Universe has nearly doubled in the last year.
Table of Contents

Figure 22. Diverse datasets within the Recursion Data Universe are highly complementary. The Recursion Data Universe consists of complementary datasets spanning multiple data modalities. While phenomics data can be generated cost-effectively and at scale, other datasets such as transcriptomics, proteomics and InVivomics offer increasing insight as we translate programs from early discovery through development.
Phenomics
At the core of the Recursion Data Universe is our proprietary cellular image dataset generated by our automated phenomics platform. While investigating various biological and chemical contexts, the readout remains constant: a fluorescent microscopy image that captures composite changes in cellular morphology; a cellular phenotype. We use our proprietary staining protocol to capture these changes in cellular morphology across nearly all of our phenomic experiments. This protocol, consisting of six subcellular dyes imaged in six different channels, has been optimized to capture a wide array of biology across nearly any human cell type that can be cultured and perturbed in laboratory conditions. As a result, we can capture the effects of a wide range of biological and pharmacological phenomena of interest, including phenotypic changes induced by small molecules, genetic gain- and loss-of-function, toxins, secreted factors, cytokines, or any combination of the above.
Table of Contents

Figure 23. Our fluorescent staining protocol images multiple large cellular structures to capture a holistic assessment of cellular state. We use fluorescent dyes to stain a set of common cellular substructures that are subsequently captured using fluorescent microscopy imaging. Combined with tools from the Recursion OS, this complex and rich biological data modality can inform a host of scientific questions. The top image is a composite of the 6 channels. It is followed by each of the 6 individual channel faux-colored images of HUVEC cells: nuclei in blue, endoplasmic reticula in green, actin in red, nucleoli in cyan, mitochondria in magenta and Golgi apparatus in yellow. The overlap in channel content is due in part to the lack of complete spectral separation between fluorescent stains.
Cellular morphology is a holistic measure of cellular state that integrates changes from underlying layers of cell biology, including gene expression, protein production and modification and cell signaling, into a single, powerful readout. Images are also two-to-four orders of magnitude more data-dense per dollar than other -omics datasets that focus on these more proximal readouts, enabling us to generate far more data per dollar spent to inform our drug discovery efforts. Indeed, since 2017 we have approximately doubled the capacity of our phenomics platform each year and currently generate up to 13.2 million images or 110 terabytes of new data to the Recursion Data Universe per week across up to 2.2 million experiments. Lastly, our phenomics approach builds on the recent explosion of powerful computer vision and ML approaches driven by the technology industry over the last half decade. Modern ML tools can be trained to identify the most salient features of images without relying on any pre-selected, disease-specific subject matter expertise, even if these features are imperceptible to the human eye. Using these tools, we can capture the aggregate cellular response induced by a disease-causing perturbation or therapeutic, and quantify these changes in an unbiased manner, freeing us from human bias. In contrast, traditional drug discovery relies on presumptive target hypotheses and bespoke biological signaling assays that only capture narrow, pre-determined biology and thus limit the scope of biological exploration.
Figure 24. ML algorithms can detect cellular phenotypes that are indistinguishable to the human eye. Most morphological differences within our images are too subtle for the human eye to detect, but ML algorithms like those we deploy in our Recursion OS can readily distinguish between them. The heatmap of similarities shown here between learned embeddings of these images shows clear separation of highly similar cellular changes while even well-trained cell biologists or pathologists would be hard-pressed to describe consistent differences between these cell cultures.
Table of Contents

Orthogonomics
Phenomics provides cost-effective, information-rich and functional biological data well-suited for broad biological exploration. However, other data modalities such as transcriptomics and proteomics can be highly complementary. Both of these approaches generate supplemental data that can be useful for i) unraveling the mechanism of action by which a compound is active and/or ii) more precisely measuring (and confirming) a compound’s functional activity and efficacy. While the costs to measure bio-molecules using these approaches are orders of magnitude more expensive compared to phenomics, this data can be highly informative in order to advance programs. In particular, when used in a targeted manner (e.g., to follow up on predicted potential mechanisms of action) rather than broad primary profiling, orthogonomic approaches may deliver net value even at a higher per-measurement cost. Additionally, if we are able to generate this data cost-effectively and at scale, we may be able to significantly reduce the time needed to develop specific assays on a per bio-molecule basis. Collectively, we refer to these alternative modalities as orthogonomics, the generation and integration of orthogonal -omics-level datasets as a part of the Recursion Data Universe.
Scaled Transcriptomics. We have developed an in-house laboratory process capable of profiling over 20,000 genes from samples drawn from any of our biological modules. Throughout 2021 we leveraged our transcriptomic data generation engine to accelerate our biological understanding of many of our programs. We currently have the capability of processing up to 6,100 individual transcriptome samples per week, and have generated 91,400 whole transcriptome observations as of the end of 2021. The incorporation of in-house production-scale sequencers has reduced our transcriptomics data turnaround time by 70%. We intend to continue to develop, mature and scale this technology as a means to obtain valuable orthogonal data and a deeper understanding of the biology and pharmacology of our programs and lead molecules.
Proteomics. In 2021, we executed thousands of screens of proteomic samples, obtaining proteoprints for over 7,000 proteins for each in vitro and in vivo sample studied, and leveraged this data across over a dozen internal programs to inform our research operating plans and obtain a deeper understanding of the biology and pharmacology of our programs and lead molecules.
Other Scaled -omics. Exploration and development of scaled metabolomics and lipidomics are on our roadmap as additional medium-throughput mechanisms for orthogonal validation.
ADMET Assays
While our phenomics platform has historically been used to identify signals of compound efficacy, we explored the use of our image-based readout to predict ADMET properties of promising compounds early in the drug discovery process. Poor in vivo pharmacokinetics, including unwanted side effects, are a major driver of late-stage drug program failures.
To train predictive ADMET models, our team has built large-format ADMET datasets spanning various compound liabilities including CYP inhibition, which can indicate a risk of complication from drug-drug interactions and hERG liabilities, which can suggest a heightened risk for heart arrhythmias. This ADMET data has been combined with phenomic and compound structure data to create early predictive models, winnowing those drug candidates with a higher likelihood of potential liabilities before investing time and resources.
InVivomics
In vivo studies are an important tool for providing an assessment of the efficacy and safety of a compound within the context of a complete, complex biological system. Similar to other steps within the drug discovery and development process, conventional in vivo studies are fraught with human bias and limited in the endpoints that they measure. Using our In Vivo Data Collection Infrastructure, we can collect more holistic measurements of an individual animal’s behavior and physiological state using continuous video feeds and our proprietary animal cages, surveilling animals in their home environment. By automating the process of data collection, we can amass uninterrupted data on animal behavior and physiology across days, weeks, or even months allowing for a more accurate and holistic assessment of the animal’s health state across the entirety of the study. This data can subsequently be used to create more abstract representations of animal behavior, potentially allowing us to rapidly phenotype new animal models and identify in vivo disease signatures that may be more relevant for assessing compound efficacy and potential liabilities.

Bespoke Assays
In addition to the large format datasets described above, our team is experienced at developing custom assays needed for program-specific validation at a smaller scale. These assays encompass diverse biomolecules, including nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, allowing for complete coverage across diverse therapeutic areas. Representative examples of these bespoke assays include high-content protein translocation readers and multiplexed readers to measure protein changes, qPCR or bead-based technologies to measure panels of transcript changes, mass spectrometry to measure more challenging biomolecules, electric cell-substrate impedance sensing and flow cytometry to measure distinct cellular subpopulations.
As this data is generated, it is included in our data warehousing system that connects bespoke assays with the rest of the Recursion Data Universe.
Navigating Tools
Our Navigating Tools are a rapidly growing suite of in-house software applications designed to process and translate data from the Recursion Data Universe into actionable insights for our research and development teams to accelerate programs.
Figure 25. Navigating Tools. Our Navigating Tools are a suite of proprietary data generation, discovery and development tools that explore and transform data into actionable insights. The combination of our proprietary data generation and software tools provides the basis for data-driven decision making.
Data Processing Tools
Table of Contents

To understand, explore and relate new or existing data in the Recursion Data Universe, we must normalize, transform and analyze the data. Our tools in this layer manage the streaming of our data at scale to the appropriate public and private cloud, the transformation of our images into mathematical representations through our in-house proprietary convolutional neural networks, and the standard and custom analyses performed on our data as parameterized and requested by users. Anomalies are flagged to the team for fast resolution.
Figure 26. We convert raw images into a list of features that allows cross-image comparison. Microscopy images are run through a deep convolutional network with an architecture similar to the one above. The network is trained on our phenomics data so that, layer by layer, each image is transformed into a list of 128 features representing the cellular biology in the image. The resulting features power downstream analysis.
Biological and Chemical Activity Assessment
Our activity assessment tools enable us to evaluate the robustness of diverse disease model phenotypes and subsequently measure the activity of potential therapeutic agents within these disease models. These tools are target-agnostic by design, explore cellular biology holistically and enable the exploration of many disease models and potential therapeutics simultaneously with no significant alteration to the core platform.
Table of Contents

Figure 27. Our proprietary user interface enables our biologists to rapidly identify compounds with maximum positive effect on a disease phenotype while minimizing side effects. The results from our empirical hit identification screens allow drug discovery teams to rapidly explore results and focus on compounds that are believed to be the most promising. 
Program Insights
We translate processed data into actionable insights which fall into two categories: i) insights into underlying biology and early therapeutic starting points and ii) insights into the specific chemical substrate of interest. We mine the Recursion Data Universe to predict therapeutic activity and behavior that may seed new NCE programs or new uses for KCE programs. We use an additional suite of tools to infer a compound’s mechanism of action and potential ADMET liabilities based on measures of similarity to other high-dimensional landmarks in our dataset and predictive models incorporating images and chemical structure.
PhenoMap. PhenoMap is a massive relational database of biological and chemical perturbation phenotypes that allow us, based on phenotypic similarity, to infer the relationship between any two perturbations (or groups of perturbations) in silico. To date, we are able to infer over 200 billion biological and chemical relationships, which are generated solely by ML tools without any human bias and may allow us to understand the mechanisms underpinning disease and how to manipulate them. For example, we can query the similarity (or dissimilarity) created by the CRISPR-engineered knockout of any two genes from our whole-genome arrayed CRISPR screen, revealing both known and novel drug targets never before described in scientific literature. We can also query the similarity between any small molecule in our library and all genetic knockouts, uncovering a compound’s mechanism of action and, most importantly, can infer the activity of such molecules against high-value drug targets. Our ability to probe the relationships between any perturbation in our library (spanning the genome and approximately one million small molecules) changes drug discovery from an iterative trial-and-error process into a computationally driven search problem.
Table of Contents

Figure 28. The PhenoMap allows our team to simultaneously view multiple relationships between genes and compounds. Our PhenoMap enables us to rapidly explore inferred biological and chemical relationships in order to: i) discover targets, ii) predict active hits, iii) optimize for similar or dissimilar relationships, and iv) predict mechanisms of action.
We are looking to augment the above insights by including data and predictions related to physicochemical and structural information about compounds, synthesizable compounds not yet tested on our platform, ADMET assays, and in vivo experiments.
Compound Intelligence. Our Compound Intelligence (CI) tools generate early insights into specific therapeutic candidates, helping us to advance candidates with favorable properties while culling candidates with higher likelihoods of failure. Using one application of CI, we can elucidate the mechanism of action of NCE compounds either by comparing a compound’s phenotype to: i) those phenotypes from our whole-genome arrayed CRISPR experiments (querying whether the phenotype induced by inhibition of a small molecule mimics any genetic knockout in our library) or ii) those phenotypes induced by well-annotated compounds in our repurposing library. Using a different application within CI, we can use our growing ADMET dataset and computational models to predict specific ADME and toxicology endpoints for therapeutic candidates. Compounds with low predicted ADMET properties are advanced. Compounds with high predicted ADMET properties may be discarded or flagged for subsequent investigation.
Program Acceleration
Once insights have surfaced, our researchers have a suite of digital chemistry and translational tools at their disposal to optimize compounds and accelerate discovery and development programs.
Compound Atlas. Compound Atlas is a collection of our proprietary and commercially-available digital chemistry tools that enables our scientists to expand from promising therapeutic starting points into more diverse chemical structures using large, enumerated chemical libraries from vendors such as Enamine and WuXi. Scaffold Shopper, a module within Compound Atlas, can compare candidate compounds identified by our platform to over 12 billion ready-to-synthesize and off-the-shelf molecules based on our 3D chemical functionality and shape-based similarities within a matter of minutes and at a low computational expense. Additionally, we have built software that enables our chemists to rapidly assemble dense mini-libraries around reproducible and validated hit molecules to accelerate structure-activity relationship (SAR) establishment without requiring custom synthesis. 
Table of Contents

Figure 29. Scaffold Shopper enables our chemists to rapidly identify read-to-synthesize and off-the-shelf compounds for hit expansion. Comparisons are based on 3D chemical functionality and shape-based similarities generated within a matter of minutes and at a low computational expense.
Molecular Firehose. Molecular Firehose filters the expansive search results from Compound Atlas, so that our medicinal chemists can rapidly prioritize molecules of interest. Chemists can dynamically filter search results with a range of molecular properties and both 2D and 3D-based similarity scoring to better identify an appropriate compound set to order for synthesis from our chemical vendors.
Figure 30. Molecular Firehose filters multiple properties to rapidly identify viable compounds to synthesize.
InVivomics Research Suite
Table of Contents

The InVivomics Research Suite is our proprietary collection of software tools that enable scientists to monitor and analyze behavioral and physiological data from ongoing and completed in vivo studies. Study data for individual animals or aggregated across study groups can be explored in near real-time, better ensuring that the final study data will be reproducible and interpretable. Continuous monitoring allows researchers to similarly flag unexpected effects that may arise from animal handling, dosing, or compound liabilities and modify or terminate the study as needed. At the end of the study, graphical and tabular data are automatically generated to aid in the evaluation of study results and the design of follow-up in vivo studies.
More importantly, continuous video feeds and our proprietary animal cages enable us to amass uninterrupted data on animal behavior and physiology across days, weeks, or even months. ML tools within our InVivomics Research Suite can then be used to create more abstract representations of animal behavior, allowing us to rapidly phenotype new animal models and identify in vivo disease signatures that may be more relevant for assessing potential compound safety and efficacy attributes.
Figure 31. InVivomics Research Suite allows our team to track and analyze a broad range of data in ongoing animal studies. These tools enable our in vivo scientists to monitor individual subjects through near real-time video feed and data generation and review study level data.
Data Warehousing System
 We employ a data warehousing system that encompasses the Recursion Data Universe, electronic lab notebooks generated by our research scientists, and technical analyses posted to our internal knowledge repository by our data and ML scientists. This data warehousing system is centralized and accessible for authorized Recursionauts and helps preserve institutional knowledge, further collective learning, and generate ideas for new discovery and development tools.
Bridging from Recursion OS Insights to Program Advancement
Reason to Believe. In order to identify novel program starting points, it is critical that the Recursion OS can accurately predict relationships across diverse domains of biology. To confirm the accuracy of our predictions, we have demonstrated that our approach recapitulates hundreds of well-known biological pathways. In the example below, we illustrate our map based predictions for approximately 150 gene knockouts from canonical biological pathways and known agonists or antagonists of these same pathways. By comparing the phenotypes induced by these perturbations to one another using our Recursion OS, we observed that each perturbation creates a unique phenotype and phenotypes form clusters that recapitulate well-understood biological pathways, including genes involved in Bcl-2 signaling, NF-KB signaling, RAS signaling, JAK/STAT signaling, and TGFß signaling.
Table of Contents

Figure 32. Inferred relationships between genes and small molecules faithfully recapitulate well known biology. Above, we show a visualization of approximately 0.00001 % of our map of biology (~22,500 of 203 billion predicted relationships) produced by our Recursion OS for well studied genes and small molecules. Increasingly dark shades of red reflect an increasing degree of phenotypic similarity. Increasingly dark shades of blue reflect an increasing degree of phenotypic oppositeness or anti-similarity (which often suggest inhibitory relationships between genes, though possibly distal). Highlighted sections reveal expected relationships along well-studied biological pathways.
These findings not only validate the accuracy of our inference relationships, but also suggest that we can use our approach of mapping and navigating biology and chemistry to identify new drug targets or early therapeutic starting points to seed new drug discovery programs. While there is no typical drug discovery program, most programs proceed as follows.
Step 1: Navigate the Map to Identify Novel Biological Targets and/or Early Therapeutic Starting Points. Using the Recursion OS, we can profile, map, and subsequently navigate relationships among diverse biological perturbations, including CRISPR gene knockouts, soluble factors, bacterial toxins and small molecules based on the similarity (shades of red in the figure above) or anti-similarity (shades of blue in the figure above) of each perturbation’s high-dimensional phenotype. Using these relationships, we can elucidate both potential novel drug targets or early potential therapeutic compounds to start new drug discovery programs. With more than 200 billion predicted relationships, there are more potential programs in our maps of biology than we can prosecute. For example, at a ‘hack-week’ in 2021, more than 100 potential new drug discovery programs were elucidated by about a dozen teams over 7-10 days using these maps. The maps mean that generating a program hypothesis requires no new wet-lab work; scientists simply use our software tools to navigate biology and chemistry.
Step 2: Empirically Confirm Map-Based Insights. Having selected a target and/or compound of interest based on its inferred activity, we then physically screen candidate compounds in the disease-relevant background to confirm our predictions. These experiments, deemed ‘lightning screens,’ are designed to confirm predicted relationships of interest from our map within 1-4 weeks. Data from the direct confirmation of a map-based insight is funneled back to project teams who can then make go/no-go decisions on initiating a program.
Step 3: Orthogonally Validate Insights. In addition to understanding and refining the chemistry (see steps 4 and 5 below), project teams build research operating plans based on confirmed map-based insights. These plans span orthogonal in vitro validation of the relationship (e.g., using various cellular -omics technologies, such as transcriptomics), bespoke assay development and evaluation, animal model validation and/or patient-derived cellular assay evaluation. We strive for independence in our validation both in the disease models used (e.g., in vivo
Table of Contents

models, in vitro systems) and in the endpoints measured (e.g., phenomics vs. transcriptomics vs. tumor growth in an in vivo model).
Step 4: Predicting the Mechanism of Action. Having confirmed our predictions empirically, for NCE programs, our medicinal chemists work to further understand the mechanism by which compounds are operating using our maps, often in parallel with our orthogonal validation work in step 3 above. Our compound library contains approximately six thousand compounds with well-annotated mechanisms of action. Using our mapping and navigating software tools and the phenotypes from these compounds, as well as from thousands of genes that we have knocked out using our CRISPR-gene editing tools, our chemists can compare the phenotypes of our validated compounds to these high-dimensional landmarks and assess their degree of similarity to identify potential mechanisms of action.
Figure 33. Compounds with the same mechanism cluster together phenotypically. A UMAP plot where each dot represents a different compound. Compounds that are phenotypically similar reside closer together and recapitulate mechanistic similarities.
Step 5: Optimize Validated Compounds into Viable Drug Candidates. While a compound may be active in our screens, most early therapeutic starting points have low potency and undesirable drug properties and must be optimized before advancing into in vivo and, ultimately, human studies. During the lead optimization process, our chemists rely upon our phenomics platform to repeatedly measure changes in compound potency and selectivity that result from changes in compound structure. Our chemists also take advantage of our burgeoning suite of proprietary digital chemistry tools to conduct chemical expansion exercises across more than 12 billion molecules in our in silico library which we can then order for validation on the platform.
Because this process may extend over several months, it is critical that our platform assay is highly stable over time. To ensure this stability, we test that our assay can reproduce specific measures of compound activity, such as a compound’s EC50 (the concentration of a drug that gives half-maximal response) or max-effect (the maximal response), in experiments run weeks, or even months, apart.
Table of Contents

In the example below, we ran four separate experiments of a HIF2a inhibitor known to be active against our VHL disease model over a period of three months. Dose-response curves across all four runs demonstrate a high degree of overlap, including highly similar EC50s and max-effect. Our calculated minimum significance ratio from this study, a common industry metric of in vitro assay reproducibility over time, is 1.076, which is highly robust by industry benchmarks7. These results demonstrate the stability of our assay and the ability to use our phenomic platform as a basis for SAR.
Figure 34. Compound activity is reproducible across experimental runs. Dose response curves from multiple runs of the same tool compound against our disease model for VHL loss-of-function show high consistency with a minimum significance ratio of 1.076.
Step 6: Select and Advance Drug Candidates into Clinical Trials. After optimizing therapeutic drug candidates, we select those compounds that have the best chemical properties to advance through development and ultimately clinical trials. We have built the internal capabilities to drive clinical candidates through IND-enabling studies, regulatory approval processes, and human clinical studies. Collectively, members of our team have been involved in over 700 clinical programs, including recently completing our first SAD and MAD studies in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, we work closely with a team of external consultants across regulatory, CMC, and clinical operations to ensure execution success.
Our Programs - Deep Dive
Every program at Recursion is a product of our Recursion OS. Our wholly-owned programs are built on unique biological insights surfaced through the Recursion OS and target diseases where: i) the disease-biology is well defined and ii) there is high unmet medical need, there are no approved therapies, or there are significant limitations to existing treatments. Several of our programs target indications with market opportunities expected to be near to or in excess of $1.0 billion in annual sales and we are preparing four programs to enter Phase 2 or Phase 2/3 clinical trials within the first three quarters of 2022 and a fourth program to enter a Phase 1 clinical trial within the second half of 2022.

Figure 35. Examples of current Recursion programs falling into our First, Second and Next Generation paradigms. The earliest iterations of the Recursion OS leveraged brute-force search (where small molecules were tested directly in the context of each disease model we built) and used a small molecule library restricted primarily to known chemical entities. Programs arising from this iteration of the Recursion OS are deemed First Generation Programs. As we developed our chemistry capabilities and new chemical entity library at Recursion, Second Generation Programs arose, though the throughput needed to screen large libraries of new chemical entities presents a powerful but relatively inefficient solution. Today, most of our new programs, as well as new partnerships or expansions of prior partnerships, are Next Generation Programs, whereby we use our maps of biology to navigate to novel or unexpected relationships between molecules (known or new chemical entities) and then validate those predictions in our wet-labs.

In addition to the programs highlighted above, we are actively developing dozens of additional programs which may prove to be drivers of our future growth. As we have significantly expanded our chemistry capabilities in the last year, and continue to invest deeply in these key elements of the Recursion OS, moving forward we expect that the vast majority of our new programs will be part of our Next Generation of potential programs discovered using our tools for mapping and navigating biology. We believe that the number of potential programs we can generate with our Recursion OS is key to the future of our company, as a greater volume of validated programs has a higher likelihood of creating value. The speed at which our OS generates a large number of product candidates is important, since traditional drug development often takes a decade or more. In addition, we believe that our large number of potential programs makes us an attractive partner for larger pharmaceutical companies. The static or declining level of R&D output at many large companies means that they have an ongoing need for new projects to fill their pipelines.

First Generation Program - REC-994 for Cerebral Cavernous Malformation

Early Discovery | Late Discovery | Preclinical | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3

Summary
REC-994 is an orally bioavailable, superoxide, scavenger small molecule being developed for the treatment of CCM. In Phase 1 SAD and MAD trials in healthy volunteers directed and executed by us, REC-994 demonstrated excellent tolerability and suitability for chronic dosing. CCM is among the largest rare disease opportunities and has no approved therapies. We recently enrolled the first patient in a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, tolerability and exploratory efficacy study.
Disease Overview
CCM is a disease of the neurovasculature for which approximately 360,000 patients in the US and EU5 have been diagnosed or suffer symptoms. Less than 30% of patients with CCM experience symptoms, resulting in the disease being severely underdiagnosed and suggesting that well more than 1 million patients may have the disease in the US and EU5. CCM and its hallmark vascular malformations are caused by inherited or somatic mutations in any of three genes involved in endothelial function: CCM1, CCM2, or CCM3. Approximately 20% of patients have a familial form of CCM that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Sporadic disease in the remaining population is caused by somatic mutations that arise in the same genes. CCM manifests as vascular malformations of the spinal cord and brain characterized by abnormally enlarged capillary cavities without intervening brain parenchyma. Patients with CCM lesions are at substantial risk for seizures, headaches, progressive neurological deficits and potentially fatal hemorrhagic stroke. Current non-pharmacologic treatments include microsurgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery. Given the invasive and risky nature of these interventions, these options are reserved for a subset of patients with significant symptomatology and/or easily accessible lesions. Rebleeds and other negative sequelae of treatment further limit the effectiveness of these interventions. There is no approved pharmacological treatment that affects the rate of growth of CCM lesions or their propensity to bleed or otherwise induce symptoms. CCM can be a severe disease resulting in progressive neurologic impairment and a high risk of death due to hemorrhagic stroke.
Product Concept
We are developing an orally bioavailable small molecule therapeutic designed to alleviate neurological symptoms associated with CCM and potentially reduce the accumulation of new lesions. REC-994 is an orally bioavailable small molecule superoxide scavenger with pharmacokinetics supporting once-daily dosing in humans. Mechanistically, the reduction of endothelial superoxide species has been shown to reverse the cellular pathogenesis of the disease. In addition, REC-994 exhibits anti-inflammatory properties which could be beneficial in reducing disease-associated pathology. Preclinical data have demonstrated benefit on acute to subacute disease-relevant hemodynamic parameters such as vascular permeability and vascular dynamics. Chronic administration in rodent genetic models of CCM has demonstrated long-term benefit in reduction of lesion number and/or size. REC-994 was well tolerated at up to 800 mg daily dosing in healthy human subjects enrolled in our Phase 1 study, and there were no severe adverse events at any dose tested. The safety results of the Phase 1 studies we executed support continued evaluation of REC-994 in a Phase 2 study. We licensed global rights for the data underlying our novel usage of REC-994 from the University of Utah in February 2016 and have obtained orphan drug designation in the US and EU.
Preclinical
Table of Contents

The novel use of REC-994 for CCM was discovered leveraging knock-down of the disease gene CCM2 in primary human endothelial cells using the earliest form of the Recursion OS. In secondary orthogonal assays, REC-994 reversed defects in human endothelial cell-cell junctional integrity, a functional phenotype associated with the loss of CCM2.
REC-994 was subsequently tested in two endothelial-specific knockout mouse models for the two most prevalent genetic causes, Ccm1 and Ccm2. These mouse models faithfully recapitulate the CNS cavernous malformations of the human disease. Mice treated with REC-994 demonstrated a decrease in lesion number and/or size compared to vehicle treated controls. Notably, 24-hour circulating plasma levels of REC-994 in this in vivo experiment were consistent with exposures seen in humans at a 200 mg daily dose.
Figure 37. REC-994 reduces lesion severity in chronic mouse models of CCM Disease. Mice treated with REC-994 demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the number of small-size lesions, with a trend toward a decrease in the number of mid-size lesions.
Clinical
We recently enrolled the first patient in a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, tolerability and exploratory efficacy study.
We conducted a SAD study in 32 healthy human volunteers using active pharmaceutical ingredients with no excipients in a Powder-in-Bottle dosage form. Results showed that systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) generally increased in proportion to REC-994 after both single and multiple doses. Median Tmax and t1/2 appeared to be independent of dose. There were no deaths or SAEs reported during this study and no TEAEs that led to the withdrawal of subjects from the study. These data supported a MAD study in healthy human volunteers.
The MAD study was conducted in 52 healthy human volunteers and was designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of multiple oral doses of REC-994, to bridge from the Powder-in-Bottle dosage form to a tablet dosage form, as well as to assess the effect of food on PK following a single oral dose. Overall, multiple oral doses of REC-994 were well tolerated in healthy male and female subjects at each dose level administered in this study. There appeared to be no dose-related trends in TEAEs, vital signs, ECGs, pulse oximetry, physical examination findings, or neurological examination findings. Pharmacokinetic results support once-daily oral dosing with the tablet formulation.

We recently enrolled the first patient in an exploratory Phase 2 double-blind placebo-controlled, safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics study of REC-994 in the treatment of symptomatic CCM. The study is enrolling patients with symptomatic CCM at least 18 years of age with anatomic CCM lesions demonstrated by MRI. The primary objective of the Phase 2 study will be to assess the safety and tolerability of daily dosing of a low and high dose group of REC-994 over 12 months, compared to placebo, in patients with symptomatic CCM. Exploratory secondary endpoints will include assessment of patient reported outcomes, imaging assessments, as well as established composite scales for neurological signs and symptoms.
Currently, there is no development or regulatory precedent or pathway for CCM drug development. We will undertake an exploratory Phase 2 to inform a pivotal trial design with guidance from the FDA.

Competitors
There are two investigator-initiated clinical studies underway to study marketed therapeutics in CCM patients.
•Investigators at the University of Chicago are evaluating the efficacy of atorvastatin, or Lipitor, on reduction in hemorrhage rate in patients with CCM.
•Investigators at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Italy are evaluating the efficacy of the approved beta blocker propranolol in reducing lesions and clinical events.
To our knowledge, the REC-994 program is the only industry-sponsored therapeutic program in clinical trials for CCM. If approved, REC-994 would be the first pharmacologic disease-modifying treatment for CCM, one of the largest areas of unmet need in the rare disease space.
First-Generation Program - REC-2282 for Neurofibromatosis Type 2

Early Discovery | Late Discovery | Preclinical | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3

Summary
REC-2282 is a small molecule HDAC inhibitor being developed for the treatment of NF2-mutant meningiomas. The molecule has been well tolerated, including in patients dosed for multiple years, and potentially reduced cardiac toxicity that differentiates it from other HDAC inhibitors. In contrast to approved HDAC inhibitors, REC-2282 is both CNS-penetrant and orally bioavailable. We expect to enroll the first patient in an adaptive, parallel group, Phase 2/3, randomized, multicenter study in the second quarter of 2022.
Disease Overview
Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant, inherited, rare, tumor syndrome caused by loss-of-function mutations in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene, which encodes the cell signaling regulator protein merlin. Loss of NF2 results in growth of the hallmark tumors that characterize this disease: vestibular schwannomas (VS) and meningiomas. The tumor types of VS and meningiomas seen in NF2 are among the most common in neuro-oncology. In addition, NF2 mutations give rise to spontaneous meningiomas, mesotheliomas, and underlie subsets of additional tumor types. Combined, we believe NF2-driven meningiomas occur in approximately 33,000 patients per year in the US and EU5. Patients with NF2 are diagnosed typically in their late teens or early 20s and present with hearing loss which is usually unilateral at the time of onset, focal neurological deficits, and symptoms relating to increasing intracranial pressure. Although the course of disease progression is highly variable, most patients are rendered deaf, and many will eventually need wheelchair assistance due to progressive neurological decline. The standard of care is surgery or radiosurgery and patients may require multiple operative procedures during their lifetime. Although surgery or radiation can be effective in controlling tumor growth, most surgical procedures result in morbidity related to neurological deficits based on the location of the tumor. Hearing loss, facial nerve palsy, and moderate facial nerve dysfunction are also common surgical outcomes. Radiation can induce malignant transformation which in turn makes surgery more complex. In addition, tumors may recur post-surgical resection along with the growth of new tumors. NF2-associated tumors and treatment related morbidity can lead to earlier than expected mortality. If left untreated, NF2-driven tumors can result in death resulting from rising intracranial pressure.
Product Concept
Table of Contents

REC-2282, is an orally bioavailable, CNS-penetrating, pan-histone deacetylase, or HDAC, inhibitor with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway modulatory activity. By comparison to marketed HDAC inhibitors, REC-2282 is uniquely suited for patients with NF2, and NF2-mutant CNS tumors, due to its oral bioavailability and CNS-exposure. NF2 disease is driven by mutations in the NF2 gene, which encodes an important cell signaling modulator, merlin. Loss of merlin results in activation of multiple signaling pathways converging on PI3K/AKT/mTOR among others. Human clinical pharmacodynamic data supports the role of REC-2282 in inhibiting activity of multiple aberrant signaling pathways in NF2-deficient tumors. HDAC inhibitors induce growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis of cancer cells. We obtained a global license for REC-2282 from the Ohio State Innovation Foundation in December 2018. Orphan drug designation for REC-2282 in NF2 has been granted in the US and EU. Fast Track Designation for REC-2282 in NF2-mutated meningioma was granted in the US in 2021.

Preclinical
The novel use of REC-2282 for NF2 was discovered leveraging the knock-down of the disease gene NF2 in human cells in the Recursion OS. We did not see similarly robust responses in the context of many other tumor suppressor genes studied, suggesting some specificity of the mechanism in the context of NF2 loss of function.

After we discovered the novel use of REC-2282 for NF2 using our platform, we performed a literature search to better understand the molecule and validate disease models. At that time, we discovered that REC-2282 had been shown to inhibit in vitro proliferation of vestibular schwannoma, or VS, and meningioma cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis at doses that correlate with AKT inactivation. In preclinical models, REC-2282 inhibited the growth of primary human VS and NF2-deficient mouse schwannoma cells, as well as primary patient-derived meningioma cells and the benign meningioma cell line, Ben-Men-1.
In animal models of NF2, REC-2282 suppressed in vivo growth of an NF2-deficient mouse vestibular schwannoma allograft. In addition, REC-2282 suppressed in vivo growth human vestibular schwannoma xenograft models in mice fed, either a standard diet of rodent chow, or chow formulated to deliver 25 mg/kg/day REC-2282 for 45 days. REC-2282 also suppressed the growth of an orthotopic mouse model of NF2-deficient meningioma using luciferase-expressing Ben-Men-1 meningioma cells. These animal data served as a functional and orthogonal validation of our platform findings.

Clinical
We expect to initiate a parallel group, two-staged, Phase 2/3, randomized, multicenter clinical trial within the next quarter.
Previous clinical work conducted in investigator-initiated trials and trials sponsored by Arno Therapeutics (no longer a licensor of Ohio State University for this molecule) includes human exposure to REC-2282, previously referred to as AR-42. A total of three completed studies in adult human subjects were conducted in the United States in patients with solid or hematological malignancies. Published data from Ohio State University reflects that a total of 77 patients were treated with REC-2282 in doses ranging from 20 mg to 80 mg three times a week for three weeks followed by one week off-treatment in four-week cycles. Multiple patients were treated for multiple years using this dosing regimen at the 60 mg dose and the longest recorded treatment duration is 4.4 years at the 40 mg dose. The majority of adverse events were transient cytopenia that did not result in dose reduction or stoppage. The MTD in patients with solid tumors was determined to be 60 mg. The REC-2282 plasma exposure in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors generally increased with increasing doses. There were no consistent signs of plasma REC-2282 accumulation across a 19-day administration period nor obvious differences in PK between hematologic and solid tumor patients.
In another early Phase 1 pharmacodynamic study by Ohio State University, it appears that REC-2282 suppressed aberrant activation of ERK, AKT, and S6 pathways in vestibular schwannomas resected from treated NF2 patients. These results may be difficult to achieve with single pathway inhibitors of ALK or MEK.
We are planning to initiate an adaptive, parallel group, two-staged, Phase 2/3, randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of REC-2282 in patients with progressive NF2 mutated meningiomas with underlying NF2 disease and sporadic meningiomas with documented NF2 mutations.

The study is designed to accelerate the path to potential product registration by allowing for initiation of a confirmatory Phase 3 study prior to full completion of Phase 2. It is a combined Phase 2-3 study design, beginning with a Proof-of-Concept Phase 2 portion in which 20 adult subjects (and up to nine adolescent subjects) will begin treatment on two active dose arms. Subject safety will be monitored by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, which will apply dose modifications and stopping rules as indicated. After all 20 adult subjects have completed six months of treatment, an interim analysis will be performed for the purposes of 1) determination of go/no-go for Phase 3 portion of the study, 2) selection of the dose(s) to carry forward, 3) re-estimation of sample size for the planned Phase 3, and 4) agreement from FDA to initiate Phase 3. Subjects in the Phase 2 will continue treatment for up to 26 months total and then have the option to enroll in an Open Label Extension study. The Phase 3 portion of the design currently requires recruitment of an additional 60 subjects (adult and potentially adolescent subjects), who will receive treatment for up to 26 months. The planned primary endpoint is Progression-Free Survival (PFS).

First Generation Program - REC-4881 for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) 


Early Discovery | Late Discovery | Preclinical | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3

Summary
REC-4881 is an orally bioavailable, non-ATP-competitive allosteric small molecule inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 being developed to reduce polyp burden and progression to adenocarcinoma in FAP patients. REC-4881 has been well tolerated in prior clinical studies, consistent with the intended use and has a gut-localized PK-profile in humans that is highly advantageous for FAP, and potentially other APC-driven gastrointestinal tumors. We expect to enroll the first patient in a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled basket trial in the third quarter of 2022. 
Table of Contents

Disease Overview
FAP is a rare tumor syndrome affecting approximately 50,000 patients in the US and EU5 with no approved therapies. FAP is caused by autosomal dominant inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor gene APC, which encodes a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. FAP patients develop polyps and adenomas in the colon, rectum, rectal pouch, stomach, and duodenum throughout life. These growths have a high risk of malignant transformation and can give rise to invasive cancers of the colon, stomach, duodenum, and rectal tissues. Standard of care for patients with FAP is colectomy in late teenage years. Without surgical intervention, affected patients will progress to colorectal cancer by early adulthood. Post-colectomy, patients receive endoscopic surveillance every 6-12 months to monitor disease progression given the ongoing risk of malignant transformation. 
Despite surgical management, the need for effective pharmacological therapies for FAP remains high due to continued risk of duodenal and desmoid tumors post-surgery. These tumors occur in the majority of patients and surgical resection of these tumors can be associated with significant morbidity. NSAIDs, such as sulindac or celecoxib, are sometimes used to treat these tumors, but have limited efficacy and do not impact pre-cancerous lesions. While surgical management and surveillance have improved the prognosis for FAP patients, desmoid tumors remain a major cause of death in patients with FAP following colectomy. 
Product Concept
Our REC-4881 candidate is an orally bioavailable, non-ATP-competitive allosteric small molecule inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 (IC50 2-3 nM and 3-5 nM, respectively) that has demonstrated potent reduction in polyps and dysplastic adenomas, in the Apcmin mouse model of FAP. In a previous Phase 1 clinical study run by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, 51 patients with solid tumors were treated with REC-4881 and did not demonstrate the typical ocular toxicities associated with this class. REC-4881 exhibits extremely low hepatic metabolism and its primary route of elimination is through biliary excretion and gastrointestinal elimination, which may allow it to achieve preferential exposure at tumor sites in the duodenum and lower gastrointestinal tract with reduced systemic exposures and toxicity. We obtained a global license for REC-4881 from Takeda Pharmaceuticals in May 2020. Orphan drug designation for REC-4881 in FAP and APC-driven tumors was granted by the FDA in 2021. 
Preclinical
The novel use of REC-4881 for FAP was discovered leveraging knock-down of the FAP disease gene APC in human cells using the Recursion OS. We validated our findings using tumor cell lines and spheroids grown from human epithelial tumor cells with a mutation in APC. REC-4881 inhibited both the growth and organization of spheroids in these models and, in tumor cell lines, had well over a 1,000-fold selectivity range in cells harboring APC mutations. 


Figure 43. Impact of REC-4881 on an APC model on the Recursion OS. REC-4881 reversed the effects of knockdown of APC in primary human cells using our phenomics assay. 
We subsequently evaluated REC-4881 in a disease relevant preclinical model of FAP. Mice harboring truncated Apc, or Apcmin, were treated with multiple oral daily doses of REC-4881 or celecoxib (as a comparator) over an eight-week period. Mice treated with celecoxib had approximately 30% fewer polyps than did those treated with vehicle, whereas mice treated with 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg REC-4881 exhibited approximately 50% fewer polyps than vehicle-treated mice. Mice that were treated with 10 mg/kg REC-4881, the highest dose tested, exhibited an approximately 70% reduction in total polyps.

Polyp count at start of dosing reflects animals sacrificed at the start of study (15 weeks of age). P < 0.001 for all REC-4881 treatment groups versus vehicle control. 
In FAP, polyps arising from mutations in APC may progress to high-grade adenomas through accumulation of additional mutations and eventually to malignant cancers. To evaluate the activity of REC-4881 on both benign polyps and advanced adenomas, gastrointestinal tissues from mice treated with REC-4881 were histologically evaluated and polyps were classified as either benign or high-grade adenomas. While celecoxib reduced the growth of benign polyps in the model, a large proportion of polyps that remained were dysplastic. By contrast, treatment with REC-4881 specifically reduced not only benign polyps, but also precancerous high-grade adenomas, a finding with the potential for translational significance.

While celecoxib reduces benign polyps, the majority of remaining lesions are high grade adenomas. By contrast, REC-4881 reduces both polyps and high-grade adenomas. 
REC-4881 is a non-ATP-competitive and specific allosteric small molecule inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2. Studies have shown that mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, or MEK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, or ERK signaling is activated in adenoma epithelial cells and tumor stromal cells, including fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells. 
In addition, genomic events resulting in alteration of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, or MAPK, such as activating mutations in KRAS, are frequent somatic events that promote the growth of adenomas in FAP. Therefore, suppression of aberrant MAPK signaling in adenomas of FAP with REC-4881 has the potential to regress or slow the growth of these tumors by acting on core pathways driving their growth.

Millennium Pharmaceuticals previously conducted clinical work including human exposure using REC-4881, then referred to as TAK-733. A total of 51 patients were included in the Phase 1 study, which demonstrated that REC-4881 had a manageable toxicity profile up to the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, of 16 mg dosed on days one to 21 of 28-day treatment cycles. The most common adverse events were dermatitis acneiform rash (53%), fatigue (36%), and diarrhea (31%), consistent with other MEK inhibitors. No dose-limiting toxicities, or DLTs, were observed in patients who received REC-4881 in doses from 0.2 mg to 8.4 mg. Four patients experienced DLTs of grade 3 dermatitis acneiform at doses of 12 mg (n=1), 16 mg (n=1), and 22 mg (n=2). Importantly, REC-4881 demonstrated fewer adverse ocular side effects compared to approved drugs in this class. Our preclinical data in FAP support a low dose cohort in the Phase 2 trial in the dosing range where DLTs were not experienced in the prior Phase 1 (0.2 - 8.4 mg).
Study C20001 was a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, first-in-human clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of TAK-733 (now REC-4881) in patients with advanced, nonhematologic malignancies and melanoma.

First Generation Program - REC-3599 for GM2 Gangliosidosis

Early Discovery | Late Discovery | Preclinical | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3

Table of Contents

Summary
REC-3599 is an orally bioavailable, selective, potent small molecule inhibitor of Protein Kinase C beta, or PKCß, and Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, or GSK3ß being developed for the treatment of infantile GM2 gangliosidosis. REC-3599 has demonstrated strong reduction of pathogenic biomarkers GM2 and lipofuscin levels in cells derived from patients with multiple different mutations in either HEXA or HEXB, referred to as Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff Disease, respectively. We are planning to generate additional pharmacodynamic and efficacy data in a sheep model of GM2. We anticipate enrolling the first patients in a Phase 2 trial in infantile GM2 patients in 2024.
Disease Overview
GM2 gangliosidosis, or GM2, is a lysosomal storage disease affecting approximately 400 patients in the US and EU5. The disease is caused by mutations in either HEXA or HEXB genes which encode subunits of the lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase enzyme. Mutations in HEXA lead to Tay-Sachs disease and mutation in HEXB lead to Sandhoff disease. GM2 presents during infancy, childhood, or later in life depending upon the degree of genetic deficiency and is classified by the period of onset: Infantile onset, Juvenile onset, and Late-onset Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff Disease. Patients with infantile GM2 are diagnosed in the first year of life and exhibit rapidly progressing neurological decline, associated with neuronal lysosomal dysfunction and GM2 accumulation, resulting in complete neurological disability and premature death in the first few years of life. Some of the earliest observed signs include retinal abnormalities and exaggerated startle reflex within the first six-months after birth. Affected infants may achieve some motor milestones at close to expected normal developmental age up to about 12-months; however, they will ultimately lose any gained motor skills, including basic skills such as the ability to turn over, sit, crawl, and swallow, by the age of 18-24 months and usually succumb to their disease prior to age four. There are no approved symptomatic or disease modifying treatments for the disease. Standard of care for these patients is supportive interventions, including seizure control with anticonvulsants, assisted feeding through a nasogastric tube, or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, and, ultimately, ventilatory support. While progression of the disease remains rapid, supportive care can provide some improvement in the survival for patients with infantile GM2.
Product Concept
We are developing a small molecule therapeutic as monotherapy or in combination with gene therapy to slow progression of neurological decline in patients with infantile GM2. REC-3599 is an orally bioavailable, CNS-penetrant small molecule inhibitor of PKCß with additional inhibitory activity on GSK3ß. In preclinical studies, REC-3599 demonstrated potent and concentration-dependent reduction of GM2-ganglioside accumulation and sphingolipid-associated autofluorescence in infantile GM2 patient-derived fibroblast models at IC50s suitable for human dosing. REC-3599 is hypothesized to play a dual role in modulating lysosomal biogenesis through inhibition of GSK3ß while also stimulating cellular autophagy through inhibition of PKCß. Eli Lilly previously studied REC-3599, then referred to as ruboxistaurin, in adult patients with diabetic retinopathy, including in Phase 3 clinical trials. The compound has been dosed in over >2,500 adult human subjects with treatment durations as long as two years. REC-3599 has been well tolerated in adult human subjects, supporting its evaluation in this rare and devastating infantile neurological disease. We executed a relevant in vivo pharmacodynamic study and juvenile rodent toxicology studies at the request of the FDA to help bridge entry into pediatric populations. 
In 2015, Eli Lilly out-licensed the rights for ruboxistaurin to Chromaderm; we subsequently licensed the global rights to ruboxistaurin from Chromaderm for all systemic uses in December 2019. We obtained pediatric rare disease designation for REC-3599 in GM2 in 2020. We plan to seek orphan drug designation for REC-3599 in GM2 following the generation of additional pharmacodynamic data in a HEXA deficient GM2 animal model and completion of the planned Phase 2 study in patients with infantile GM2 gangliosidosis.
Preclinical
The novel use of REC-3599 for GM2 was discovered leveraging the Recursion OS using a knockdown of the GM2 disease gene HEXB in human cells.
Table of Contents

Figure 48. Impact of REC-3599 on HEXB model. REC-3599 reversed the effects of knockout of HEXB in human cells using our phenomics assay.
In Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, the loss of function of ß-hexosaminidase results in the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides and lipofuscin in the lysosome. Exposure of infantile GM2 patient fibroblast lines to REC-3599 resulted in a reduction in GM2 ganglioside aggregates, total GM2 levels, and lipofuscin-associated autofluorescence to levels comparable to apparently healthy control-derived fibroblast lines. These data are consistent with an improvement in lysosomal function resulting from REC-3599 exposure.
REC-3599 was initially developed as an inhibitor of PKCß; however, the compound also demonstrates weaker but significant inhibitory activity against GSK3ß. GSK3ß is a known inhibitor of lysosomal biogenesis, and inhibition of GSK3ß has been shown to lead to increased lysosomal production and function by activating transcription of lysosomal genes regulated by transcription factor TFEB. Additionally, inhibition of GSK3ß leads to pro-survival autophagic signaling through TFEB. In parallel, results support the role of PKCß as an inhibitor of cellular autophagy, a key cellular process in lysosomal-mediated degradation that is impaired in lysosomal storage diseases. Thus, the dual action of REC-3599 in modulating lysosomal biogenesis through inhibition of GSK3ß while also stimulating cellular autophagy through inhibition of PKCß, may underlie the unique activity of REC-3599 in human cellular models of GM2.

Infantile Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease patient fibroblasts exhibit higher: mean GM2 fluorescence (left panel), aggregate counts (middle panel), and autofluorescent substrate accumulation (right panel).
Clinical
We are planning to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in Infantile GM2 in 2024.
Previous clinical work conducted by Eli Lilly includes considerable human exposure to REC-3599, including a total of 37 studies in adult human subjects with a total of 4,094 participants: 26 clinical pharmacology studies (including a QT study) that included a total of 573 adult subjects that have established the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of REC-3599; and 11 placebo-controlled studies that included a total of 3,521 adult subjects with diabetes and moderate to severe non-proliferative retinopathy. An additional 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trials in adults with diabetic macular edema and 1 safety and PK study in patients with diabetes were conducted after the initial marketing applications and included an additional 1,069 adult subjects. 
Table of Contents

In the clinical pharmacology studies, single doses of REC-3599 up to 256 mg and multiple daily doses up to 128 mg given over two weeks were taken by healthy subjects. In double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety and efficacy studies, REC-3599 was administered at daily doses of 4, 8, 16, and 32 mg for ≥ 36 months, and 64 mg for ≥ 12 months. In the Eli Lilly clinical trials REC-3599 has been well tolerated at the doses administered to adults.
Safety information provided in Eli Lilly’s NDA 22005 supports the safety profile of REC-3599 in adult patients. The summary of safety conclusions was as follows: Most adverse events were noted to be mild to moderate severity and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug; the safety profile of REC-3599 was similar regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, and type of diabetes. REC-3599 32 mg administered once per day was the intended dose for patients with diabetic retinopathy. In Eli Lilly’s clinical program, the incidence of patients with at least 1 serious adverse event, or SAE, was lower in 32 mg REC-3599 treated patients compared with placebo; the pattern of SAEs did not suggest any organ-specific or systemic toxicity. Analyses of laboratory measures, vital signs, and ophthalmic safety assessments revealed no clinically significant safety concerns.
Upon satisfactory completion of in vivo pharmacodynamic and efficacy studies in the sheep HEXA model, we expect to initiate an open-label Phase 2a study evaluating the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of REC-3599 in patients with Infantile GM2 gangliosidosis. We expect to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial in 2024.
•The study will be conducted in pediatric patients with confirmed diagnosis of infantile GM2. 
•The study will consist of four periods: screening, dose escalation, treatment, and follow-up. The anticipated treatment period is 36 months.
•An interim analysis is planned after 12 months of treatment of the last enrolled patient. 
•We will track the achievement of development milestones, neurological function, and quality of life using established and validated composite scales.

Key Competitors
Key competitors to the REC-3599 program consist of two therapeutic categories, gene therapies and small molecule substrate reduction therapies. Two companies are developing AAV-based gene therapies to restore functional beta-hexosaminidase enzymes by gene delivery:
•Taysha Gene Therapies is developing an AAV-based gene therapy, TSHA-101. The program is currently in Phase 2.
•Sio Gene Therapies is also developing an AAV-based gene therapy, AXO-AAV-GM1/GM2. The program is currently in Phase 1/2.
Two companies are developing small molecule substrate reduction therapies:
Table of Contents

•Sanofi is developing Venglustat as an orally bioavailable small molecule hypothesized to reduce substrate accumulation in GM2 and other lysosomal storage diseases. The program is currently in Phase 3 studies in patients with late-onset GM2.
•IntraBio is developing N-Acetyl-L-Leucine as an orally bioavailable amino-acid ester. The program has completed a Phase 2 study.
While restoration of gene function with gene therapies offers large potential therapeutic benefit for patients with genetic diseases such as GM2, results from other devastating neurological conditions such as spinal muscle atrophy suggest that, even with an efficacious gene therapy, unmet need is expected to remain high. Thus, we anticipate that multiple therapies administered in combination, including gene therapies, may offer the potential for the greatest benefit for patients with severe neurological conditions, such as GM2.
Second Generation Program - REC 3964 for Clostridium difficile Colitis


Early Discovery | Late Discovery | Preclinical | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3

Summary
REC-3964 is an orally active, gut-biased, small molecule inhibitor of C. difficile glucosyl transferase. This molecule has the potential to prevent recurrent disease and be used as secondary prophylaxis therapy in high-risk patients with C. difficile infections, a leading cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhea and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. REC-3964 is progressing through IND-enabling safety studies. We anticipate a Phase 1 start in healthy volunteers in the second half of 2022.
Disease Overview
C. difficile-induced diarrhea is a leading cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhea and arises from the disruption of normal bacterial flora in the colon. Toxins A, or TcdA, and B, or TcdB, secreted by the bacterium are responsible for considerable morbidity, including severe diarrhea, colitis, toxic megacolon, sepsis, extended hospital stays, and, potentially, death. More than 730,000 patients are diagnosed in the US and EU5 each year. Recurrence of disease occurs in 20-30% of patients treated with standard of care. Standard of care includes antibiotic therapies which can further impair flora, and lead to relapse.
Product Concept
We aim to develop REC-3964 as the first safe and efficacious, orally bioavailable, small molecule toxin inhibitor of C. difficile, which could be used to prevent recurrent infections and potentially used prophylactically in high-risk patients, including elderly immunocompromised patients in long-term care facilities who have a history of related infections and hospitalizations. REC-3964 was designed for gut-biased pharmacology to target the infection at its anatomic site in the GI tract while reducing systemic exposure and potential systemic effects. In addition, this molecule represents a novel mechanism that could be used in combination with currently approved and novel antimicrobials in development for this disease. Unlike antibiotic treatments that can eliminate the gut microbiota and further enhance C. difficile infection, this toxin-targeted mechanism would not be expected to negatively impact the gut microbiome. REC-3964 could have the potential to offer protection against recurrent C. difficile infections, thereby preventing significant morbidity and mortality. 
Preclinical 
We identified early molecules in the series on the Recursion OS using gut epithelial cells exposed to C. difficile Toxin B. REC-3964, which we have selected as our development candidate for this disease, displays nanomolar potency on our platform as well as in orthogonal functional validation assays including electric cell substrate impedance sensing, a measure of barrier integrity. We have shown in a target-based validation assay that REC-3964 inhibits glucosyltransferase (IC50 = 1.2-10 nM), suggesting suppression of toxin-induced glycosylation of Rho-GTPases in host cells as the most likely mode of action. REC-3964 has negligible off-target activity, produces favorable gut and plasma exposure levels following oral dosing, and is non-mutagenic. REC-3964 also improves survival in a hamster model of C. difficile infection.

Second Generation Program - REC 649127 for Neural or Systemic Inflammation


Early Discovery | Late Discovery | Preclinical | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3

Summary
We have identified REC-649127 and other compounds in this series to have excellent oral bioavailability, robust brain exposure, and broad anti-inflammatory effect in vitro and in vivo. These compounds appear to act via a unique non-kinase mechanism to modulate the NFκB pathway. We are working to identify the specific molecular target(s). Many diseases are driven by inflammatory processes, and modulation of this pathway may be beneficial in both peripheral inflammation diseases, such as psoriasis, and in neuroinflammation related to neurodegenerative and other diseases. The program is currently in Late Discovery and focused on improving chemical matter.
Disease Overview
Inflammatory processes are key to innumerous major diseases, affecting tens of millions of patients in the US and EU5. These conditions may be systemic in nature, such as psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis, or focused on the central nervous system, including multiple sclerosis and a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. For some of these indications, there are a variety of safe and efficacious therapies available to patients, such as anti-TNFs for psoriasis or S1P modulators for multiple sclerosis. However, a sizable number of patients may never respond to these approaches, acquire resistance to drugs over time or have a condition with few therapeutic options available to them. A hallmark of many of these diseases is the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β and MCP-1, by activated immune cells like microglia or macrophages. These cytokines, in turn, drive disease progression.
Product Concept
We aim to discover and develop novel, orally bioavailable small molecules with well-tolerated anti-inflammatory effects and the potential for use in a variety of CNS and systemic inflammatory diseases. Modulating NFκB-driven inflammation via a novel or unconventional mechanism could enable the treatment of patients who do not respond well to currently available therapeutics. Precise modulation of such pathways could also provide a therapeutic avenue for neuroinflammation, such as that seen in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Because they may modulate the NFκB pathway differently from existing therapeutics, these molecules may provide benefit either as single agents or in combination with other therapies.
Preclinical
In May 2021, we identified REC-649127 and related compounds using our Recursion OS via a rescue screen of TNFα-stimulated HUVEC cells, where they exhibited a unique pattern of partial inhibition in comparison to IKK inhibitors used as benchmarks. REC-649127 and compounds in this series have shown anti-inflammatory activity in stimulated HUVEC, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived microglia, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In contrast to IKK inhibitors, which completely inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine release in LPS-stimulated human PBMC, our compounds partially inhibit the release of multiple cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα, among others. Thus, these compounds appear to act via a mechanism that is distinct from known upstream modulators of the NFκB pathway, such as IKK inhibitors. REC-649127 dosed orally reduced levels of IL-6 and multiple other cytokines in the plasma and hippocampus in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced acute inflammation. Larger effects were seen in the plasma than in the brain, as expected based on relative compound exposure in each compartment (mouse brain Kpu,u = 0.4). REC-649127 also reduced skin thickening and cumulative Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score after 8 days of oral dosing, suggesting that observed reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels by REC-649127 are physiologically relevant. REC-649127 and other compounds in this series are in Late Discovery.

Next Generation Program - REC 65029 for HRD-negative ovarian cancer

Early Discovery | Late Discovery | Preclinical | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3

Summary
Table of Contents

We identified a novel lead molecule with oral bioavailability that is capable of sensitizing homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) negative ovarian cancer and beyond to PARP inhibitors. There are approximately 14,000 cases per year of HRD-negative ovarian cancers in the US and EU5. PARP inhibitors have significantly improved outcomes for patients with HRD-positive tumors. However, patients with HRD-negative tumors are either not eligible for certain PARP-targeted therapies, or have worse response rates. There are currently no approved therapies developed to sensitize HRD-negative tumors to PARP inhibitors. This program is currently in the lead optimization phase to improve chemical matter. 
Disease Overview
Ovarian cancer carries a particularly poor prognosis as most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Mutations in genes involved in the DNA Damage Repair pathway, including BRCA1/2, are in up to 50% of ovarian cancer patients. PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, rucaparib, and niraparib were developed to exploit the resulting susceptibility to additional genomic damage in tumors harboring these mutations. HRD-positive patients have seen outcomes improve approximately twofold, with even better survival data seen in BRCA1/2 mutant tumors; however, HRD-negative tumors have not similarly benefited from PARP inhibition. Patients with HRD-negative tumors have poorer prognosis and unfavorable outcomes. 
Product Concept
We aim to discover and develop novel, orally bioavailable small molecules that drive de novo sensitivity to PARP inhibitors in HRD negative tumors. CDK12 inhibition has been proposed as a mechanism to drive sensitivity to PARP in this setting, but the high homology of CDKs makes targeting a single isoform difficult and prone to off-target toxicity. Mimicking the effects of CDK12 inhibition via alternative novel targets could be a route to increase applicability of PARP inhibitors in HRD negative tumors. We intend to position this agent in combination with PARP inhibitors in HRD negative ovarian cancer, and potentially explore single agent activity. 
Preclinical
In December 2020, we identified REC-65029 to mimic the loss of CDK12 through inhibition of a novel target via our inferential search capabilities. Based on this data, we initiated animal studies evaluating single agent and combination activity with olaparib in an HRD-ovarian cancer CDX, OVCAR-3, and PDX, OV0273. In the OVCAR-3 model, we observed statistically significant reduction in tumor volume by both REC-65029 alone and in combination with olaparib vs. vehicle or single agent olaparib. In the OV0273 PDX, we observed 100% CR for both single agent REC-65029 and combination. vs. vehicle or single agent olaparib. We also saw significant improvement in survival for animals treated with REC-65029. We are currently evaluating several analogs in vitro and plan to advance these to in vivo studies.

In the OVCAR-3 CDX model (left panel), mice were treated with REC-65029 (85 mg/kg, BID, PO) ± olaparib (100 mg/kg, QD, PO) for 21 days. In the REC-65029 arms, mice were originally treated at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 5 days, followed by a dosing holiday from days 6 to 9 due to body weight loss. As a result, REC-65029 was dose reduced to 85 mg/kg from day 9 to day 21, and all mice subsequently recovered. In both arms, single agent REC-65029 or in combination with olaparib resulted in a statistically significant partial response vs either

olaparib or vehicle arms. In the OV0273 PDX model (center and right panel), mice were treated with REC-65029 (85 mg/kg, BID, PO) ± olaparib (90 mg/kg, QD, PO) for 28 days. At this lower dose, informed from the CDX model, weight loss was not observed and no dosing holiday was required. All mice achieved 100% CR (n=10) by day 18, with a statistically significant improvement in survival > 30 days post final dose. ** p<0.01, **** p<0.0001.
Next Generation Program - REC-648918 to enhance anti-tumor response by inhibiting a novel target (alpha)

Early Discovery | Late Discovery | Preclinical | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3

Summary
We identified a hit series using our inferential-search approach that is capable of amplifying the response to checkpoint therapy in vivo. A therapy that enhances anti-PD-(L)1 effect has the potential to increase the response rate of anti-PD-(L)1-eligible patients or expand the eligibility criteria of patients not expected to respond to immune checkpoint therapy. Additional priming of tumors can have a significant benefit, as response rates in some checkpoint-eligible settings are as low as 14%. In addition, many tumor types have proven intractable for immunotherapy and could greatly benefit from this approach. There are currently no approved therapies that act directly to increase responsiveness to immune-checkpoint therapy. This program is currently in the validated lead to lead phase.
Disease Overview
Anti-PD-(L)1 therapies have significantly changed the landscape of cancer therapy over the past ten years. In eligible patients, overall survival has been nearly doubled and serious adverse events have been nearly halved when compared to standard chemotherapy. Despite indications of antitumor immunity, such as PD-L1 expression, low response rates persist in many checkpoint-eligible settings. Furthermore, checkpoint therapy and strategies to add secondary immune activation (e.g. STING or dual checkpoint) have been shown to amplify treatment-limiting immunotherapy-related adverse events (IRAEs). An agent that increases sensitivity to anti-PD1 therapy without concomitant increases in peripheral inflammation could enhance response rates in under-responsive tumor types.
Product Concept
We aim to discover and develop novel, orally bioavailable small molecules that drive de novo sensitivity to immune checkpoint therapies. Using inferential-search approaches, we identified a lead compound, REC-648918, that attenuates multiple tumor-intrinsic genetic resistance signatures by inhibiting a novel target. We intend to position this therapeutic in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 in checkpoint-eligible and checkpoint-resistant patients.
Preclinical
In August 2020, we prioritized the target of REC-648918 as a potential attenuator of multiple immunotherapy escape targets. Based on this data, we initiated animal studies in April 2021 to evaluate the combination of REC-648918 in a CT26 tumor model. The compound demonstrated a significant amplification of immune checkpoint efficacy. Complete responders were re-challenged with CT26 tumors, with 75% rejecting reimplantation. In addition, we also showed increased response in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy in an EMT6 tumor model. In measurement of peripheral cytokine levels, IL-6 was decreased relative to anti-PD-1 therapy alone, indicating that the increase in antitumor response is not coupled with an increase in peripheral inflammation. However, intra-tumoral IFN-Ɣ was increased in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy. Current NCE efforts have focused on increased potency in biochemical and cellular assays and improved in vivo kinetics over REC-648918. Several analogs are currently undergoing in vivo evaluation.

Four of ten mice treated with the combination achieved complete responses (upper left panel). When re-challenged with CT26 tumor on the opposite flank, 3 of 4 mice with complete responses rejected implantation (upper center panel). Cytokine levels were analyzed in the tumor and periphery by Luminex. In plasma, the increase in IL-6 observed in aPD1 was not observed in vehicle, REC-648918 or a combination of anti-PD-1 and REC-648918 (lower left panel). Intratumorally, IFN-Ɣ was elevated with aPD1 treatment and with the combination of aPD1 and REC-648918 (statistical significance not observed) (lower right panel). In a subcutaneous EMT-6 breast cancer model, 2 of 10 mice achieved CR in the aPD1 arm and 8 of 10 with aPD1 combined with REC-0648918 (upper right panel). When re-challenged, all mice that achieved CR rejected re-implantation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma affects approximately 60,000 individuals per year in the US and EU5, with nearly 40% of those patients harboring alterations in the WNT pathway, which reduces responsiveness to immunotherapy. There are currently no approved therapies developed to specifically modulate tumor response in Wnt-pathway mutant cancers. Using our Maps of biology, we have identified a clinical stage molecule, REC-2029, with the potential to treat Wnt-mutant HCC. REC-2029 could potentially be used as a single agent or in combination therapy with anti-PD-(L)1 therapies.
Disease Overview
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer accounting for 90% of cases. HCC is one of the most intractable solid tumors; current treatments are considered a success with ORRs of ~25%, and the median progression-free survival is both short (6 months) approximately equivalent among all available first-line 
Table of Contents

therapies. Genetic alterations in WNT-pathway genes CTNNB1 (~30%) and AXIN1 (~11%) may confer resistance to ICI in small retrospective studies of HCC. Despite belonging to the same signaling pathway, mutations in these genes are found to be mutually exclusive. Currently, there are no actionable mutations to guide treatment decisions, and PD-L1 status has not been shown to be predictive for advanced cases. 
Product Concept
We aim to develop an orally bioavailable small molecule that could be used as a single agent or potentially in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy for the treatment of HCC with AXIN1 mutations that are resistant to standard of care and/or immunotherapy. We have identified REC-2029 as a potential route to restore the intractability of AXIN1 loss of function.
Preclinical
In October 2020, we identified a relationship between clinical-stage compound REC-2029 and Wnt pathway alterations in our Map data. On the basis of this inference, we advanced REC-2029 directly into two animal models. REC-2029 produces a significant difference in tumor growth volume versus vehicle and cabozantinib in an AXIN1/TP53 mutant HCC PDX which is resistant to standard of care cabozantinib. REC-2029 also produced single agent and combination efficacy in B16F10-ova syngeneic mouse model, a model harboring mutations in APC and TP53 & elevated CTNNB1.

Left) REC-2029 produces a significant difference in tumor volume versus vehicle and cabozantinib in an AXIN1/TP53 mutant HCC PDX. Cabozantinib was not significant versus vehicle. Right) REC-2029 produced single agent efficacy in B16F10-ova syngeneic mouse model, a model harboring mutations in APC and TP53 & elevated CTNNB1, and also rescued the effect of anti-PD1 therapy.
Next Generation Program - REC-14221 and other small molecule Myc inhibitors


Early Discovery | Late Discovery | Preclinical | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3

Summary
We identified multiple hit series using our inferential-search approach on the Recursion OS that subsequently showed concentration-dependent suppression of transcriptional activity downstream of MYC. Increased expression of MYC transcriptional target genes present across oncology and up to 50% of cancers harbor alterations in MYC. Novel small molecules with the potential to suppress MYC-dependent activity could improve the treatment of diverse tumors and especially those harboring mutations in genes directly implicated in MYC activation. There are currently no approved molecules that target MYC specifically. This program is currently in the hit-to-lead phase.
Disease Overview
Gain-of-function alterations in MYC have been identified in more than 50% of human cancers, but efforts to pharmacologically inhibit this protein have been hampered by a protein structure lacking in traditional compound binding pockets. In addition, MYC pathway activation is observed in tumors harboring alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors of related pathways, such as WNT-Beta-catenin. Small molecules specifically efficacious in the 
Table of Contents

context of tumors with gain-of-function MYC biology could be broadly efficacious across multiple solid tumors and hematological malignancies.
Product Concept
We aim to discover and develop novel, orally bioavailable small molecules that inhibit MYC activity for the treatment of diverse cancers characterized by aberrant activation of the MYC pathway. Using inferential-search approaches, we have identified multiple distinct structural and mechanistic classes from our chemical library involved in MYC activity or protein stability and have expanded these hits to generate multiple unique hit series.
Preclinical
In late September 2020, we identified several hit molecules, including REC-136302, REC-162977, REC-142221, REC-163196 and REC-13646, from multiple chemical series using our inferential-search approach to predict molecules with the potential to inhibit the activation of MYC. These predicted hits were validated in a cell-based luciferase MYC reporter assay in late November 2020. In addition, some members of the series are thought to impact MYC degradation based on data from MYC protein turnover assays, as well as additional novel mechanisms. We have early evidence that a number of our compounds cause selective killing of c-MYC amplified and dependent cancer cell lines. We are continuing to expand, characterize and validate our lead series using our digital chemistry tools. 

Figure 58. Selective effect of potential lead molecules on c-MYC-amplified and c-MYC-dependent cell line proliferation. CTG (CellTiter-Glo) assays were used to quantify cell proliferation inhibition. REC-136467 and REC-142221 selectively induce cell death (50% reduced cell viability at 1 uM concentration) in two c-MYC amplified/MYC-dependent cell lines while having no significant effect on MYC-independent cell line PC-12.
Next Generation Program - Immune Checkpoint Resistance in KRAS/STK11 mutant NSCLC 

Early Discovery | Late Discovery | Preclinical | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3

Summary
We have identified a novel use for a clinical-stage, orally bioavailable small molecule to restore and improve sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in tumors harboring mutations in the tumor suppressor gene STK11 and activating mutations in the oncogene KRAS. There are approximately 11,000 cases a year of KRAS/STK11 mutant metastatic NSCLC in the US and EU5, and these mutations have been shown to predict poor prognosis and resistance to ICI, specifically anti-PD(L)-1 therapies vs. mutations in KRAS alone. There are currently no approved therapies developed to specifically modulate tumor response in KRAS/STK11 mutant cancers. This program is currently in the dose-optimization phase. 
Disease Overview
STK11 is a tumor suppressor gene that is involved in a variety of cellular processes including cell metabolism, apoptosis, cell polarity, and DNA damage response. Dual mutations in KRAS and STK11 are becoming widely 
Table of Contents

recognized as a driver of resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, specifically in patients with NSCLC. Up to 30% of all NSCLC cases and approximately 14% of metastatic NSCLC cases harbor mutations in the STK11 gene, and dual KRAS/STK11 mutations are associated with reduced density of infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes leading to poor prognosis and unfavorable outcomes in patients receiving anti-PD(L)-1 therapy vs. patients with only KRAS mutations. Only 7% of NSCLC patients are estimated to derive benefit from checkpoint inhibitors and there are no FDA approved treatments targeting patients with KRAS/STK11 mutations in metastatic NSCLC. 
Product Concept
We aim to discover and develop a new generation of orally bioavailable, small molecule therapeutics that reverse the biology of STK11 deficiency and resensitize tumors to combination treatment with anti-PD(L)1 therapy. STK11 mutations attenuate tumor responses to anti-PD(L)-1. We intend to position these therapeutics in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 and other targeted therapies in both the checkpoint refractory and naive metastatic NSCLC populations. 
Preclinical
The novel use of REC-64151 for STK11 mutant NSCLC was discovered in late July 2020 using our inferential-search approach. Based on inferences made by the Recursion OS, we initiated animal studies in early December 2020 to evaluate the combination of REC-64151 with anti-PD-1 in a built-for-purpose CT26 STK11 tumor model. The compound demonstrated a statistically-significant reversal of immune checkpoint resistance and was advanced as a preclinical candidate in mid-December 2020. In early 2021, pharmacodynamic data from the CT26 animal studies showed increased infiltration of CD8+ lymphocytes in tumors. In late 2021, we also evaluated a Recursion-generated NCE molecule REC-1156840 with high Phenomap similarity to hit REC-614151 in the CT26 animal model. The combination of anti-PD-1 and REC-1156840 was significant (p=.0021) against vehicle but not anti-PD-1 alone due to partial loss of anti-PD-1 resistance in the study. We are continuing to expand on this hit series and continuing to evaluate the potential to advance REC-64151, which is a known chemical entity with clinical precedent in non-oncology settings. 


Figure 59. REC-64151 reverses immune checkpoint resistance in STK11-deficient CT26 tumors. CT26 parental and CT26 STK11 KO cells were injected into the subcutaneous flank of mice, allowed to size match, and mice were treated for 15d (CT26 STK11 KO) or 21d (CT26) with either vehicle (black), anti-PD1 (10 mg/kg/day BIW), REC-0064151 (100 mg/kg/day QD), or anti-PD1 + REC-64151 (at same doses for each compound). Tumor volumes are represented as mean ± SEM. 
Table of Contents


Figure 60. REC-1156840, a Recursion-generated NCE, was also tested in the CT26-STK11 knockout Model. REC-1156840, a chiral NCE compound, achieved similar performance as REC-64151 as measured by reversal of the platform STK11-KO phenotype, and in vivo kinetics and tumor regression in a CT26-STK11 knockout model. The combination of anti-PD-1+REC-1156840 was significant (p=.0021) against vehicle but not anti-PD-1 alone due to partial loss of anti-PD-1 resistance in the study.
Additional Programs 
In addition to the programs highlighted above, we have dozens of additional programs, which we believe will drive future opportunities for us. We believe that the number of potential programs we can generate with our Recursion OS is key to the future of our company because a greater volume of validated programs has a higher likelihood of creating value. The speed at which our OS generates a large number of product candidates is important, since traditional drug development often takes a decade or more. In addition, we believe that our large number of potential programs makes us an attractive partner for larger pharmaceutical companies. The static or declining level of R&D output at many large companies means that they have an ongoing need for new projects to fill their pipelines. 
Facilities 
Headquarters 
In 2018, we moved to our current headquarters which is located in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. We lease office, research and laboratory space under a lease that expires in May 2028 and have entered into a lease for an additional research and laboratory space that expires in March 2032. Our modern headquarters is a draw for local, national and international talent and houses both traditional and automated laboratories for drug research.

We are a proud founding member of BioHive, the branding effort of the life science hub of Utah. Working with state and local government, we are helping to create a burgeoning life science ecosystem around a downtown cluster of existing and soon to move companies centered around our headquarters. 
Satellite Offices and Facilities
Toronto and Montreal. We announced our intention to launch our first major expansion beyond our Salt Lake City headquarters in Toronto, which will serve as a multidisciplinary hub across data science, machine learning,

engineering and computational biology. Additionally, we announced a multi-year collaboration with Mila, the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, to accelerate Recursion’s machine learning capabilities. 
Research Vivarium. We lease a property that serves as a rodent vivarium in Milpitas, California under a lease that expires in May 2028. We use this facility to conduct drug-discovery enabling pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and exploratory safety studies. The facility is equipped with proprietary, digitally-enabled cage technology. 
Manufacturing Facilities. We continue to make progress in creating a CMC facility in Salt Lake City. This space is designed to bolster our capabilities in analytical and formulation chemistry as well as small molecule manufacturing for early clinical trials. We also intend to use these facilities to build out of our Closed Loop Automated 
Synthesis Suite (CLASS). 
Corporate Social Responsibility
We believe that to achieve our mission, we must act like the company we aim to be, which means we must be a good corporate citizen. Read more about how we are delivering on that belief in Recursion’s first Environmental, Social and Governance Report, released simultaneously with our annual report.
Commercialization 
We may retain significant development and commercial rights to some of our drug candidates. If marketing approval is obtained, we may commercialize our drug candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other geographies. We currently have no sales, marketing, or commercial product distribution capabilities. Decisions to create this infrastructure and capability will be made following further advancement of our drug candidates and based on our assessment of our ability to build said capabilities and infrastructure with competitive advantage. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure, manufacturing needs and major trends as to how value is accrued in the industry may all influence or alter our commercialization plans. 
Manufacturing 
We currently utilize contract development and manufacturing organizations to produce drug substance and investigational drug product in support of the assets within our pipeline. To date, we have obtained drug substance and drug product for our drug candidates from third party contract manufacturers. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our drug candidates on a project-by-project basis based on our development needs. 
We continue to make progress in creating a CMC site in Salt Lake City. This space is designed to bolster our capabilities in analytical and formulation chemistry as well as small molecule manufacturing for early clinical trials. See also the section titled “Manufacturing Facilities.”
Strategic Agreements 
In order to achieve our mission, we partner with leading biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, and academic research institutions to identify novel therapeutics and unlock biological insights using our discovery technology. Our partnering efforts take two primary forms: i) Discovery Platform Partnerships and ii) Asset-Based Collaborations.
Discovery Platform Partnerships
We have and in the future may collaborate with third parties to broadly explore diverse disease domains (such as fibrosis, neuroscience, oncology, immunology, and inflammation) in order to identify novel target insights and potential therapeutics that may include small molecules, large molecules, gene therapies, and cell therapies. We may also explore a communal asset-type strategy where we license search results from our Map to partners. 
The goal of every partnership is to create therapeutics, yet the approach may take multiple forms:
•Novel Therapeutics. Without any presumptive target hypothesis, we can identify differentiated therapeutics by rapidly evaluating large compound libraries within our maps of human cellular biology.
Table of Contents

•Novel Targets. By profiling diverse biological perturbations (such as genetic factors) on our platform, we may be able to identify novel druggable targets that we can then exploit with partners to generate therapeutic candidates.
Roche & Genentech Collaboration and License Agreement 
On December 5, 2021, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Genentech, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, pursuant to which we will construct, using our imaging technology and proprietary machine-learning algorithms, unique maps of the inferred relationships amongst perturbation phenotypes in a given cellular context and together with Roche and Genentech will create multi-modal models and maps to further expand and refine such inferred relationships, in both cases with the goal to discover and develop therapeutic small molecule programs in a gastrointestinal cancer indication and in key areas of neuroscience. 
Upfront Payment. In January 2022, Roche paid us an upfront cash payment of $150.0 million.
Phenomap Creation, Acceptance, and Access. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are responsible for creating a certain number of Phenomaps in each of the Exclusive Fields. We will also provide Roche with limited access to our pre-existing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) Phenomap. Roche will have specified rights to query or access the Phenomaps to generate novel inferences that may lead to the discovery or development of therapeutic products.
Phenomap-Related Options. Each of the Phenomaps requested by Roche and created by Recursion may be subject to either an initiation fee, acceptance fee or both. Such fees could exceed $250.0 million for sixteen (16) accepted Phenomaps. In addition, for a period of time after Roche’s acceptance of certain Phenomaps, Roche will have the option to obtain, subject to payment of an exercise fee, rights to use outside the collaboration the raw images generated in the course of creating those Phenomaps. If Roche exercises its External Use Option for all twelve (12) eligible Phenomaps, Roche’s associated exercise fee payments to Recursion could exceed $250.0 million.
Collaboration Programs and Roche Options. Roche and Recursion will collaborate to select certain novel inferences with respect to small molecules or targets generated from the Phenomaps for further validation and optimization as collaboration programs. Roche and Recursion may also combine sequencing datasets from Roche with Recursion’s Phenomaps and collaborate to generate new algorithms to produce multi-modal maps from which additional collaboration programs may be initiated. For every collaboration program that successfully identifies potential therapeutic small molecules or validates a target, Roche will have an option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize such potential therapeutic small molecules or to exploit such target in the applicable Exclusive Field.
Payments if Roche Exercises Option for a Collaboration Program. Under the collaboration, Roche may initiate up to forty (40) small molecule collaboration programs. Each small molecule collaboration program, if optioned and successfully developed and commercialized by Roche, could yield more than $300.0 million in research, development, commercialization and net sales milestones for Recursion, as well as mid- to high-single digit tiered royalties on net sales. Recursion is also eligible for research, development, commercialization and net sales milestones for target collaboration programs optioned by Roche.
Recursion Programs. If Roche does not exercise its options in the Collaboration Agreement for certain collaboration programs, we may, with Roche’s prior consent, choose to independently validate, develop and commercialize products in a limited number of such programs, subject to agreed milestones and royalties to Roche. Roche will have rights to obtain an exclusive license to exploit such products by providing notice and paying us an opt-in fee and economics exceeding those that would otherwise be applicable if Roche had exercised its option for such program.
Exclusivity. During an agreed period of time after the Collaboration Agreement’s effective date, we are subject to certain exclusivities that limit our ability to conduct certain research and development activities with respect to compounds and targets in the Exclusive Fields, other than pursuant to the collaboration with Roche. However, we may continue pursuing products that we are researching and developing in the Exclusive Fields as of the effective date of the Collaboration Agreement.
Termination. The Collaboration Agreement includes standard termination provisions, including for material breach or insolvency and for Roche’s convenience. Certain of these termination rights can be exercised with respect to a particular Exclusive Field or exclusive license, as well as with respect to the entire Collaboration Agreement.

Bayer AG Research Collaboration and Option Agreement
In August 2020, we entered into a Research Collaboration and Option Agreement, or the Bayer Agreement, with Bayer AG, or Bayer. The Bayer Agreement was subsequently amended in December 2021 to incorporate usage of our biological mapping and navigating tools (inferential search). This agreement has a five-year term pursuant to which we and Bayer may initiate more than a dozen projects related to fibrosis across multiple organ systems, including lung, liver, and heart. Under the agreement, we contributed approximately 190,000 compounds from our proprietary library and Bayer contributed approximately 500,000 compounds from its proprietary library and will contribute scientific expertise throughout the collaboration. During the five-year term of the Bayer Agreement, we are prohibited from conducting certain research and development activities in the field of fibrosis outside of the collaboration, either by ourselves or together with third parties.
We received an upfront technology access fee of $30.0 million in September 2020 as part of the Bayer Agreement. Under each research project, we will work with Bayer to identify potential candidates for development. Under the agreement, Bayer has the first option for licenses to potential candidates; each such license could potentially result in option exercise fees and development and commercial milestones paid to us with an aggregate value of up to approximately $100.0 million (for an option on a lead series) or up to approximately $120.0 million (for an option on a development candidate), as well as tiered royalties for each such license, ranging from low- to mid-single-digit percentages of sales, depending on commercial success. Royalty periods for each license are on a country-by-country basis, and the duration of each such period is tied to the duration of patent or regulatory exclusivity in each country (with a minimum term of 10 years each).
If Bayer does not exercise its option with respect to a development candidate or otherwise discontinues a research project prior to completion, within a specified period of time, we may exercise an option to negotiate with Bayer in good faith to obtain an exclusive license under Bayer’s interest in any lead series or development candidate developed pursuant to the research project and backup compounds related to thereto, as well as a non-exclusive license under Bayer’s background intellectual property necessary for our use of the project results related to such compounds.
Bayer may terminate the collaboration at any time without cause. Either party may terminate the agreement for a material breach by the other party. The term of each lead series or development candidate license agreement continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (a) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the licensed patents covering such product in such country, (b) the expiration of any applicable regulatory exclusivity period for such product in such country and (c) ten (10) years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. Bayer may terminate each such license agreement at any time without cause. Either party may terminate each such license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. As of this prospectus, we have not entered into any lead series or development candidate license agreements with Bayer.
Asset-Based Collaborations
In addition to NCEs, the Recursion OS may discover new uses for known chemical entities owned or controlled by third parties. In such circumstances, we may license rights to these assets in order to advance these programs internally. Following are four such enabling licensing agreements underlying our four clinical stage programs.
REC-994: University of Utah Research Foundation Agreements
In February 2016, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with the University of Utah Research Foundation, or UURF, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license under certain patents and a non-exclusive license under certain know-how, in each case controlled by UURF and related to the drug tempol, or REC-994, to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and distribute products incorporating REC-994 worldwide for the treatment of cerebral cavernous malformation, or CCM. In partial consideration for the license rights, we issued UURF equity in our company. In addition, we agreed to reimburse UURF for a specified portion of costs associated with the filing, maintenance, and prosecution of the licensed patent rights. The Amended and Restated License Agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last-to-expire patent within the patent rights in the applicable country. UURF may terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach, if we cease commercially diligent efforts to develop or commercialize a licensed product or service, or our bankruptcy or insolvency.
REC-2282: Ohio State Innovation Foundation In-License
In December 2018, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with the Ohio State Innovation Foundation, or OSIF, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, sublicensable, non-transferable, royalty-bearing license under 
Table of Contents

certain patents and fully-paid up, royalty-free, nonexclusive license under certain know-how, in each case controlled by OSIF and related to the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, OSU-HDAC42, or REC-2282, to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products incorporating OSU-HDAC42 worldwide. OSIF also assigned certain assets to us, relating to the pharmaceutical composition known as AR-42. OSIF retains the right to use and allow other academic, non-profit and government institutions to use the licensed intellectual property for research, non-commercial and educational purposes. OSIF shall not practice, have practiced, or transfer such reserved rights for any clinical purpose other than completion of the existing clinical trials at the time of the license agreement without our prior written consent. We are developing REC-2282 for the treatment of NF2 and are evaluating the utility of the compound in additional disease states using our platform.
Pursuant to the agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize licensed products and are required to meet certain diligence milestones within two years following the execution of the agreement, including the initiation of clinical trials. The license agreement is also limited by and made subject to certain rights and regulations of the government, including the Bayh-Dole Act.
In consideration for the license, we paid OSIF an upfront payment of $2.0 million dollars and are obligated to pay OSIF certain milestones, totaling up to $20.0 million dollars, as well as mid-single digit royalties on net sales of the licensed products. In addition, we owe 25% of any non-royalty sublicensing consideration prior to a Phase II clinical trial or 15% of such sublicensing consideration after initiation of a Phase II clinical trial, provided that milestone payments are creditable against these sublicensing fees. As of the date of this filing, we have not made any milestone or royalty payments to OSIF.
The agreement expires on the expiration of the last valid claim within the licensed patents. We may terminate this agreement on 90 days prior written notice to OSIF. Either party may terminate the agreement on 60 days prior written notice for an uncured, material breach by the other party, or bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party.
REC-3599: Chromaderm License Agreement
In December 2019, we entered into a License Agreement with Chromaderm, Inc., or Chromaderm, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain know-how and future patents that may arise controlled by Chromaderm to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products containing ruboxistaurin, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, in non-topical formulations for all uses other than the treatment, prevention, and/or diagnosis of skin hyperpigmentation conditions or disorders. Chromaderm obtained an exclusive license from Eli Lilly to certain intellectual property necessary for the development, commercialization, and manufacture of ruboxistaurin and has developed certain additional intellectual property. Chromaderm reserved the right to use the licensed intellectual property to fulfill its obligations under supply and manufacturing agreements with us, and both Chromaderm and Eli Lilly reserved rights to use the licensed intellectual property to fulfill obligations under existing agreements and in the case of Eli Lilly for internal research. We are developing ruboxistaurin, or REC-3599, in various indications, including GM2. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed products in the territory in accordance with a specified development plan as may be modified by us at any time in our sole discretion. Under the agreement, we are prohibited from developing, manufacturing, or commercializing licensed products for the treatment, prevention, and/or diagnosis of skin hyperpigmentation conditions or disorders.
Under the agreement, we paid Chromaderm an upfront payment of $1.3 million. We are obligated to pay Chromaderm certain development milestones with respect to the licensed products, totaling up to $35.5 million for a first indication, up to $52.5 million if multiple indications are pursued, and certain commercial milestones totaling up to $49 million. Finally, we will owe Chromaderm mid-single-digit to low-double-digit tiered royalties on net sales of REC-3599. As of the date of this filing, we have not made any milestone or royalty payments to Chromaderm.
The agreement will expire, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, a country-by-country basis upon the later of (a) the last to expire of the licensed patents applicable to the development, manufacture or commercialization of a licensed product in such country, (b) ten years from the first commercial sale of licensed product in such country, or (c) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity of such licensed product in such country. We may terminate the agreement on 90 days prior written notice to Chromaderm. Either party may terminate the agreement upon 45 days prior written notice (15 days for payment breaches) for an uncured, material breach by the other party.
REC-4881: Takeda License Agreement
Table of Contents

In May 2020, we entered into a License Agreement, or the Takeda In-License, with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive (even as to Takeda and its affiliates), worldwide, sublicensable under certain conditions, transferable, royalty-bearing license to certain Takeda patents, know-how and materials related to develop, manufacture and commercialize Takeda’s clinical-stage compound known as TAK-733, a non-ATP-competitive allosteric inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, subject to a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, fully paid up, license back to Takeda to use the licensed compounds for non-clinical research purposes. We are currently developing the compound REC-4881 for the treatment of FAP, and patients with spontaneous APC-mutant tumors. We are also evaluating the utility of the compound in additional disease states using our platform.
We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product in each of (a) the US, (b) at least three of the following European countries: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, and (c) Japan.
Upon execution of the agreement, we paid an upfront fee of $1.5 million to Takeda. Under the Takeda In-License, we are obligated to pay Takeda milestones amounts totaling up to $39.5 million upon achievement of specified development and regulatory milestone events. In addition, we are obligated to pay Takeda low-to-mid single-digit royalties based on net sales of products containing the licensed compounds by us, our affiliates or sublicensees, subject to specified reductions. Our obligation to pay royalties continues on a country-by-country basis until the latest of expiration of the last to expire patent licensed by Takeda that covers the product, expiration of any regulatory exclusivity period for the product and ten years after the first commercial sale of the product, in such country. As of the date of this filing, we have not made any milestone or royalty payments to Takeda.
Each party has the right to terminate the license agreement for the other party’s material uncured breach, insolvency or bankruptcy. In addition, we may terminate the agreement without cause any time after May 2023, and Takeda may terminate the agreement if we have not conducted any material activities in support of the development or commercialization of the licensed compounds or any product containing a licensed compound and have not demonstrated that we used commercially reasonable efforts towards the development of such compounds or products for a period of 12 consecutive months and such failure is not due to events beyond our reasonable control. Further, Takeda may terminate the license agreement if we challenge the validity or enforceability of a licensed patent. Upon termination for any reason other than for Takeda’s breach of the license agreement, upon Takeda’s request we are obligated to negotiate in good faith, for a period of 120 days, terms and conditions of a license to Takeda under certain technology developed by us during the term of the agreement for the purpose of developing, commercializing and otherwise exploiting the licensed compounds and products containing the licensed compounds.
Competition
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company utilizing advanced technologies across biology, chemistry, automation, and computer science to discover and design therapeutics at unprecedented scale and efficiency. Our efforts to date have resulted in an expansive pipeline of differentiated programs in early discovery and preclinical development and four clinical-stage programs as well as an intellectual property portfolio comprising patents, trademarks, software and trade secrets. We believe that our differentiated approach to technology-enabled drug discovery, a combination of both wet lab and computational approaches embodied by the Recursion OS, provides us with a significant competitive advantage.
We are a hybrid company, comprising the best elements of technology-enabled drug discovery companies, scalable platform companies and traditional biopharma companies. As such, we compete within multiple categories of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries where companies are similarly working to integrate rapidly advancing technologies into their drug discovery and development activities and/or are creating scalable scientific platforms with the potential to generate large therapeutic pipelines and where other companies are developing therapies targeting indications we are or may choose to pursue. While we believe we have the competitive advantages referred to above, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, consortiums and public and private research institutions, among others, many of whom have significantly greater resources than us. Notable competitors include:
•Technology-Enabled Drug Discovery Companies. Such companies apply sophisticated computational tools to unlock novel insights or accelerate drug discovery and development across different points in the value 
Table of Contents

chain. Representative examples include Relay Therapeutics, Exscientia, Schrodinger, AbCellera, Insitro, Valo Health and Atomwise.
•Scalable Platform Companies. Such companies are applying novel scientific approaches or engineering novel therapeutic modalities with the potential to seed large numbers of therapeutic candidates. These companies may compete directly with our pipeline of predominantly small molecule therapeutics. Representative companies include Moderna, BioNTech, and CureVac.
•Traditional Biopharma Companies. Such companies, while primarily engaged in late-stage clinical development and product commercialization, are increasingly making their own investments in the application of ML and advanced computational tools across the drug discovery and development value chain. Such investments may include partnerships with other biotechnology companies (including Recursion) from which we may benefit. Representative companies include Novartis, Janssen (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Merck, and Pfizer.
•Large Technology Companies. Large technology companies constantly seek growth opportunities. Technology-enabled drug discovery may represent a compelling opportunity for these companies, some of which have research groups or subsidiaries focused on drug discovery and others of which have signed large technology partnerships with biopharma companies. Representative companies include Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, any such proceedings or claims could have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property focus is the industrialization of phenomics, a new class of -omics data, and have applied industry knowledge to date to continue to build out and expand a variety of other cutting-edge technologies. Further, we have generated algorithmic, software, and statistical insights in the course of our work. Within the burgeoning field of technology-enabled drug discovery, we seek to protect our innovations, with a combination of patents and trade secrets and for each novel technology or improvement we develop, we consider the appropriate course of intellectual property protection.
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for drug candidates and any of our future drug candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies, and know how; to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
We believe in the benefits of open-source science and that open-source data sharing drives value for us and society as a whole. For example, we have published certain key findings and datasets derived from our platform around COVID-19 under terms designed to allow anyone to make use of the data, in the hope that the data would be useful in fighting the global pandemic. We have also released some of the largest open-sourced biological datasets in the world, the RXRX1, and RXRX2 datasets, under terms that allow for broad academic and non-commercial use.
Patents
As of March 2022, we own 49 issued U.S. patents, 15 pending U.S. patent applications and we exclusively license 9 issued U.S. patents, 2 pending U.S. patent applications, 117 issued foreign patents, and 19 pending foreign patent applications. These patents and patent applications fall into 95 different patent families across 79 different jurisdictions worldwide.

Our licensed patents related to REC-4881 generally expire between 2027 and 2032, excluding any patent term adjustment or patent term extension.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of biotechnology has emerged in the United States and in Europe, among other countries. Changes in the patent laws and rules, either by legislation, judicial decisions, or regulatory interpretation in other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing, or otherwise commercializing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our platform and drug candidates and the methods used to manufacture them. Moreover, our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our platform’s drug candidates. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, which may prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates and future drug candidates and practicing our proprietary technology.
Table of Contents

Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented, or invalidated, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related platforms or drug candidates or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our drug candidates, and future drug candidates, and platforms. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with complete protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that achieve similar outcomes but with different approaches. For these reasons, we may have competition for our drug candidates. Moreover, the time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of our candidate products may shorten the length of effective patent protection following commercialization. For this and other risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms, and drug candidates, please see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies for our products or processes or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future products may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Some of our pending patent applications in the United States are provisional patent applications. Provisional patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of one or more of our related provisional patent applications. If we do not timely file any non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a nonprovisional patent application related to the patent. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. A U.S. patent also may be accorded patent term adjustment, or PTA, under certain circumstances to compensate for delays in obtaining the patent from the USPTO. In some instances, such a PTA may result in a U.S. patent term extending beyond 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application related to the U.S. patent. In addition, in the United States, the term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
Trademarks
As of January 2021, our trademark portfolio comprises more than 70 registered trademarks or active trademark applications worldwide. Such portfolio includes 20 registered foreign trademarks, 30 pending foreign trademark applications, 11 registered U.S. trademarks, and 9 pending U.S. trademark applications, among which we have issued trademarks in the U.S. for “Recursion” and “Recursion Pharmaceuticals.”
Trade Secrets
In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, drug candidates and programs, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality agreements, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, some elements of manufacturing processes, proprietary assays, analytics techniques and processes, knowledge gained through clinical experience such as approaches to dosing and administration and management of patients, as well as computational-biological algorithms, and related processes and software, are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how that are not publicly disclosed. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual 
Table of Contents

means with our employees, advisors and consultants, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. As a result, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived of by the individual during the course of employment, and which relate to or are reasonably capable or being used in our current or planned business or research and development are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against the misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. However, such agreements and policies may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for such breaches. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Government Regulation 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety, and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
U.S. Drug Development 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Drugs also are subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
•Our drug candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following: completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP; 
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
•submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for review; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
Table of Contents

•potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing; 
•FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and 
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 
The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any current and future drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. 
Preclinical Studies and IND 
The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
Clinical Trials 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection, and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB must also approve the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will generally accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles contained in the Declaration of Helsinki pursuant to 21 CFR 312.120(c)(4), incorporating the 1989 version of the Declaration, or with the laws and regulations of the foreign regulatory authority where the trial was conducted, such as the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, whichever provides greater protection of the human subjects, and with GCP and GMP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary, and the practice of medicine in the foreign country is consistent with the United States. 
Table of Contents

Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap. 
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the drug candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug. 
•Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information are collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. 
•Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, are conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. The sponsor is also responsible for submitting written IND safety reports, including reports of serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically significant increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process, as performed by the manufacturing facility, must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of our drug candidates. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our drug candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their labeled shelf life. 
NDA Review Process 
Following completion of the clinical trials, data is analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry, and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA is a request for approval to market the drug in the United States for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug. 
The application must include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy 
Table of Contents

of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be legally marketed in the United States. 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies and/or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
Orphan Drugs 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant an orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. However, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan 
Table of Contents

indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a drug candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA meeting with the FDA. 
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. 
A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. FDA may withdraw drug approval or require changes to the labeled indication of the drug if confirmatory post-market trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. 
Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designations do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. 
Post-approval Requirements 
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse events and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label promotion,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
Table of Contents

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls; 
•fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications; 
•suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
•product seizure or detention; 
•refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
A therapeutic product may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will be more likely to respond to that therapy. If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product and if the manufacturer wishes to market or distribute such diagnostic for use as a companion diagnostic, then the FDA will require separate approval or clearance of the diagnostic as a companion diagnostic to the therapeutic product. According to FDA guidance, an unapproved or uncleared companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational medical device unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. The sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations for clinical studies involving the investigational diagnostic device. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same clinical trial, if the trial meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the clinical trial protocol, the investigational product(s), and subjects involved, a sponsor may seek to submit an IDE alone (e.g., if the drug has already been approved by FDA and is used consistent with its approved labeling), or both an IND and an IDE. 
Pursuing FDA approval/clearance of an in vitro companion diagnostic would require either a pre-market notification, also called 510(k) clearance, or a pre-market approval, or PMA, or a de novo classification for that diagnostic. The review of companion diagnostics involves coordination of review with the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. 
510(k) clearance process 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a pre-market notification is submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet required the submission of a PMA application. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process may take three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take longer if FDA requests additional information, among other reasons. In some cases, the FDA may require clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification submission, the FDA may request additional information, which may significantly prolong the review process. Notwithstanding compliance with all these requirements, clearance is never assured.

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or require a PMA. In addition, the FDA may make substantial changes to industry requirements, including which devices are eligible for 510(k) clearance, which may significantly affect the process. 
De novo classification process 
If a new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a different route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification process. This process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents a low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk and requires PMA or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. 
Obtaining FDA marketing authorization, de novo down-classification, or approval for medical devices is expensive and uncertain, may take several years, and generally requires significant scientific and clinical data. 
PMA process 
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. The applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness, including information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for medical devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes extensive testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance and GMP requirements. 
Other U.S. Regulatory Matters 
•Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers, and others may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market, and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug or medical device manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the ACA (as defined below) provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act; 
•The federal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalties prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, and/or impose exclusions from federal health care programs and/or penalties for parties who engage in such prohibited conduct; 
Table of Contents

•The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations also impose obligations on covered entities such as health insurance plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain health care providers and their respective business associates, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
•The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information regarding certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
•Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the biotechnology industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and require the registration of their sales representatives, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA (as defined below). If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Manufacturing, sales, promotion, and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. In addition, the distribution of pharmaceutical and/or medical device products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage, and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical and/or medical device products. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act as well as other applicable consumer safety requirements. 
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. 
U.S. Patent-term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of any future drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug, a method for using it, or a method of manufacturing it, is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents covering 
Table of Contents

products eligible for patent term extension to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. We may seek patent term extension for any of our issued or licensed patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for a generic version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness or generate such data themselves. 
European Union Drug Development 
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. 
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials, and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. In the meantime, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU. 
European Union Drug Review and Approval 
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the 28 Member States of the European Union and three European Free Trade Association States (Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations. 
•The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
Table of Contents

•National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SOPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SOPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety, and efficacy. Similar to the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs, serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of patent protection due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval.
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. 
Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical drug candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. 
In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. 
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow the price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.

Healthcare Reform 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. 
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, was passed which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Secretary as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Additionally, for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. 
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have passed. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans. In December 2018, CMS published a new final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA-qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the 
Table of Contents

outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2029 unless additional congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations. 
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposals for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 contain further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration’s budget proposals for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 contain further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump Administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. Although a number of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
