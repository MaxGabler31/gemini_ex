Overview
 
We are a provider of proximity based data solutions that help businesses better understand and interact with consumers in various physical locations. We enable solutions that serve as a “bridge” between the physical and digital worlds, connecting people to place. By helping businesses transform their locations into smart venues, they can drastically improve their in-venue mobile experience. In addition, we help our clients identify, segment and activate their most socially influential customers at events, conferences or business locations, leading to increased brand loyalty, engagement, message amplification and revenue. Whether the locations are airports, sports venues, movie theaters, or political rallies, we enable smart interaction and data collection.
 
Our solutions will be delivered as either a Custom Integration, which is a non-recurring revenue model, or Enterprise Software as a Service or (SaaS), which is a monthly recurring revenue model.
 
Previously, our business was focused on developing a low-cost method to produce graphene. We have completed our development and research efforts around graphene through a sponsored research agreement with University of California at Santa Barbara, or UCSB, and do not see an opportunity to commercialize the findings of the research agreement. We have determined to refocus our efforts to becoming a proximity based data solutions provider to businesses. 
 
Recent Developments
 
Teaming Agreement with Nikaza 
 
On November 2, 2017, we entered into our first teaming agreement (the “Nikaza Agreement”) with Nikaza Inc. (“Nikaza”). Nikaza is an Internet of Things (IoT) platform that serves as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds, which helps business of all types transform their locations into smart venues.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Nikaza Agreement, the Company and Nikaza will seek to develop and secure contracts with potential customers in certain geographic markets for each other’s information technology services, solutions and products. If either party makes a bona fide referral of a present or potential customer to the other, the parties shall work together to develop an opportunity for one or both of the parties to provide services and/or products to the customer. Once either party is selected as the prime contractor for an opportunity that the parties are jointly pursuing, the parties shall negotiate in good faith and proceed in a timely manner to execute a mutually acceptable subcontract to perform the services and/or to provide the products of the other party as part of the opportunity. If the parties are unable to agree on a subcontract within sixty (60) calendar days after award of a prime contract, or other period if mutually agreed in writing, either party shall have the right, upon ten (10) days’ prior notice to the other party, to terminate the Nikaza Agreement with respect to the applicable opportunity. The term of the Nikaza Agreement is for one (1) year and will automatically be renewed for additional one (1) year periods thereafter unless terminated by either party upon providing thirty (30) days prior written notice before the beginning of any renewal term. 
 
The Problem 
 
 
· | The majority of mobile users consume content indoors. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Existing methods for mobile location identification are imprecise. 
· | Precise indoor location identification is critical in order to deliver a relevant experience or advertisement. 
· | Market lacks simple to deploy, integrated solution which addresses hyper-local mobile advertising, digital display and data collection.

The Solution
 
Nikaza Context Hub – The Nikaza Context Hub is the industry’s first location platform that can pinpoint a user’s location with a high degree of accuracy based on a combination of indoor- Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Beacon signals. This market leading Enterprise grade platform also enables hyper-local advertising campaign management. By deploying a Smart Sensor or Internet of Things (Iot) device that measures precise micro location using Wi-Fi, Near Field Communications, and Bluetooth signals, venue owners can gain real-time visibility to In Store Analytics such as insights into in-store guest behavior. Additionally, it provides visibility into visitation patterns broken down by day part and dwell time along with real time measurement of in-store visits at the aisle level.
Attribution - Our location data can be used to help advertisers understand the relationship between ad-impressions and in-store visits.
 
Data Collection - Location Services Framework allows for First Party data collection and activation.
 
Data Syndication - Through a proprietary network of data buyers, we facilitate the monetization of context data on behalf of an enterprise.
 
Teaming Agreement with Ampsy
 
On March 14, 2018 we entered into our second teaming agreement (the “Ampsy Agreement”) with Fandedealio, Inc. dba Ampsy, a Delaware corporation (“Ampsy”), a location based audience discovery and engagement platform for Social Channels.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Ampsy Agreement, the Company and Ampsy will seek to develop and secure contracts with potential customers in certain geographic markets for each other’s information technology services, solutions and products. If either party makes a bona fide referral of a present or potential customer to the other, the parties shall work together to develop an opportunity for one or both of the parties to provide services and/or products to the customer. Once either party is selected as the prime contractor for an opportunity that the parties are jointly pursuing, the parties shall negotiate in good faith and proceed in a timely manner to execute a mutually acceptable subcontract to perform the services and/or to provide the products of the other party as part of the opportunity. If the parties are unable to agree on a subcontract within sixty (60) calendar days after award of a prime contract, or other period if mutually agreed in writing, either party shall have the right, upon ten (10) days’ prior notice to the other party, to terminate the Ampsy Agreement with respect to the applicable opportunity. The term of the Ampsy Agreement is for one (1) year and will automatically be renewed for additional one (1) year periods thereafter unless terminated by either party upon providing thirty (30) days prior written notice before the beginning of any renewal term.
 
The Problem
 
Companies are spending significant budgets to discover and activate local audiences via social channels, however, they do not utilize the below:
 


· | No Hashtag - 80% of social posts are missing a brand relevant hashtag or keyword. Without that anchor there is no way to capture and analyze that social content and engage with that user.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | No Location Identifier – Even if a post contains a hashtag, this does not necessarily enable location accuracy. 

The Solution
 
Ampsy Platform - The Ampsy platform combines proprietary geofencing technology with real-time experience analytics to deliver a live event media aggregation service with insights about attendees who take to social during games, concerts, conferences and more. Ampsy helps identify and compartmentalize this digitally-engaged live audience, uncovering people with influence over their followers. These influencers are important ongoing sales targets, in addition to serving as candidates to be activated for future marketing campaigns. Ampsy provides the most agile and accurate location based social listening and influencer marketing / customer engagement platform in the market today.

Teaming Agreement with Glanz, Inc. 
 
On March 20, 2018, we entered into our third teaming agreement with Glanz Inc. dba Corner Media (“Corner Media”). Corner Media is a location based digital media company with a focus on premier, high pedestrian traffic locations. Corner Media brings together traditional outdoor and digital advertising to help businesses reach their ideal customers. Through digital displays, location-based mobile ads, and innovative outdoor advertising, Corner Media is helping retailers transform the way they advertise.
The Problem
 
For the longest time, the physical space has been trying to connect to the virtual one. In the past, display advertising was unconnected, static, not agile, flexible or adaptable. 
The Solution
 
We deploy an integrated proximity based mobile and programmatic display platform that leverages where people are, allowing advertisers and retail owners to identify and influence consumers in a completely new way. Using location context, advertisers and retailers can create more relevant customer experiences, understand customer data and reach consumers on their path to purchase. 
Market Opportunity
 
The market opportunity for our solutions is significant. Gartner, Inc. forecasts that 8.4 billion “things” will be in use at the end of 2017, up 31% from 2016, setting the stage for the market to approach 20 billion connected “things” by 2020. According to a recent Markets and Research report, the proximity marketing market is expected to be worth $52 billion by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 29.8% between 2016 and 2022. The current marketplace is expected to be driven by the heavy demand for personalized location-based services which enable a contextually relevant user experience. In addition, the increased use of beacons and growing availability of spatial data and analytical tools further propel the growth of this market.
 
Businesses are making approximately $6.50 for every $1.00 spent on social influencer marketing. A staggering 59% of marketers intend to increase their influencer marketing budget in 2018 and in a recent survey nearly 40% of Twitter users say they have made a purchase as a direct result of a tweet from an influencer. That said, BIA Kelsey reports that roughly 67% of marketers consider finding relevant influencers their greatest challenge.
 
Competition
 
The market for our solutions is competitive, as the demand for scalable, compliant, data solutions is rapidly increasing. We compete with private companies that offer a similar solution to ours, including Gimbal, Unacast, Near, Safe Graph, Freckle IOT, Ground Signal and public companies such as Clear Channel Outdoor ( CCO), Lamar Advertising (LAMR) and JC Deceaux Group (DEC)
 
We expect new market entrants and existing competitors to introduce new solutions that compete with ours.

M&A Opportunity
 
The market for Proximity Based data and marketing solutions is rapidly growing and therefore is incredibly fragmented. With the primary goals of increasing our asset value and diversifying our shareholder base, we have initiated a robust M&A effort by creating a deep pipeline of potential targets which meet our criteria, and a repeatable process for screening deals. We believe this space is uniquely suited for consolidation, as the number of privately held companies which meet our criteria is significant. This process involves both direct outreach by our internal business development team, in conjunction with ongoing dialogue with several merchant bankers marketing sell-side mandates. The are several factors that can negatively affect our ability to merge with or acquire a business including but not limited to the lack of liquidity in our public stock, the size of our current market cap, and our inability to raise additional capital.
 
Corporate History
 
Digital Locations, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 25, 2006 as Zingerang, Inc. On April 2, 2007, the Company changed its name to Carbon Sciences, Inc. and on September 14, 2017, the Company changed its name to Digital Locations, Inc.
Intellectual Property
 
We have filed numerous patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) in the course of our business history. However, patent applications that are not related to the current business focus of graphene have all been abandoned and we currently do not have any patent applications filed for graphene. Our Sponsored Research Agreements (“SRAs”) with the University of California at Santa Barbara (“UCSB”) give us the first right to review any new inventions arising out of the SRAs, and negotiate a license or option agreement for such inventions. 
Employees
 
We currently have two full-time employees. We have arrangements with various independent contractors and consultants to meet additional needs, including management, accounting, investor relations, research and development and other administrative functions.
