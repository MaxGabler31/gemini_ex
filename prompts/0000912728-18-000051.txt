Item 1. Business
Overview
Forward Air is a leading asset-light freight and logistics company. We provide less-than-truckload (“LTL”), truckload, intermodal and pool distribution services across the United States and in Canada. We utilize an asset-light strategy to minimize our investments in equipment and facilities and to reduce our capital expenditures. Forward Air was formed as a corporation under the laws of the State of Tennessee on October 23, 1981. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “FWRD”.
Services Provided
Our services are classified into four principal reportable segments: Expedited LTL, Truckload Premium Services (“TLS”), Intermodal and Pool Distribution. For financial information relating to each of our business segments, see Note 10, “Segment Reporting,” in the Notes to consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
Expedited LTL. We operate a comprehensive national network to provide expedited regional, inter-regional and national LTL services. Expedited LTL offers customers local pick-up and delivery and other services including shipment consolidation and deconsolidation, warehousing, customs brokerage and other handling. Because of our roots in serving the deferred air freight market, our terminal network is located at or near airports in the United States and Canada. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Expedited LTL accounted for 56.3% of our consolidated revenue.
TLS. We provide expedited truckload brokerage, dedicated fleet services, as well as high security and temperature-controlled logistics services in the United States and Canada. During the year ended December 31, 2017, TLS accounted for 16.3% of our consolidated revenue.
Intermodal. We provide first- and last-mile high value intermodal container drayage services both to and from seaports and railheads. Intermodal also offers dedicated contract and Container Freight Station (“CFS”) warehouse and handling services. 
 3

Today, Intermodal operates primarily in the Midwest and Southeast, with a smaller operational presence in the Southwest. We plan to grow Intermodal’s geographic footprint through acquisitions as well as greenfield start-ups where we do not have an acceptable acquisition target. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Intermodal accounted for 13.5% of our consolidated revenue.
Pool Distribution. We provide high-frequency handling and distribution of time sensitive product to numerous destinations within a specific geographic region. We offer this service throughout the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest and Southwest United States. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Pool Distribution accounted for 14.9% of our consolidated revenue.
Strategy
Our strategy is to take advantage of our core competencies to provide asset-light freight and logistics services in order to grow in the premium or high service level segments of the markets we serve. Principal components of our efforts include:

• | Expand Service Offerings. We believe we can increase freight volumes and revenues by offering new and enhanced services that address more of our customers’ premium transportation needs. In the past few years, we have added or enhanced LTL pickup and delivery, customer label integration, expedited truckload, temperature-controlled shipments, warehousing, drayage, customs brokerage and shipment consolidation and handling services. These services benefit our existing customers and increase our ability to attract new customers.


• | Enhance Information Systems. We are committed to the development and enhancement of our information systems in order to provide us competitive service advantages and increased productivity. We believe our information systems have and will assist us in capitalizing on new business opportunities with existing and new customers.


• | Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We continue to evaluate and pursue acquisitions that can increase our penetration of a geographic area; add new customers, business verticals and services; and increase freight volume. For example, we acquired Central States Trucking Co. (“CST”) in 2014. CST provides industry-leading container and intermodal drayage services within the Midwest, Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. CST also provides linehaul service within the LTL space as well as dedicated contract and CFS warehouse services. Since our acquisition of CST in 2014, CST has completed six acquisitions. In 2017, CST acquired certain assets of Atlantic Trucking Company, Inc., Heavy Duty Equipment Leasing, LLC, Atlantic Logistics, LLC and Transportation Holdings, Inc. (together referred to as “Atlantic”) and certain assets of Kansas City Logistics, LLC ("KCL"). 

Operations
The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our reportable segments: Expedited LTL, Truckload Premium Services, Intermodal and Pool Distribution. 
Expedited LTL
Overview
Our Expedited LTL segment provides expedited regional, inter-regional and national LTL services. We market our Expedited LTL services primarily to freight and logistics intermediaries (such as freight forwarders and third party logistics companies) and airlines (such as integrated air cargo carriers, and passenger and cargo airlines). We offer our customers a high level of service with a focus on on-time, damage-free deliveries. Our terminals are located on or near airports in the United States and Canada and maintain regularly scheduled transportation service between major cities.

Independent agents operate 23 of our Expedited LTL locations. These locations typically handle lower volumes of freight relative to our Company-operated facilities.
Shipments
During 2017, approximately 30.1% of the freight handled by Expedited LTL was for overnight delivery, approximately 55.6% was for delivery within two to three days and the balance was for delivery in four or more days.
The average weekly volume of freight moving through our Expedited LTL network was approximately 49.5 million pounds per week in 2017. During 2017, our average shipment weighed approximately 623 pounds. Although we impose no significant size or weight restrictions, we focus our marketing and price structure on shipments of 200 pounds or more.
Expedited LTL generally does not market its services directly to shippers (where such services might compete with our freight and logistics intermediary customers). Also, because Expedited LTL does not place significant size or weight restrictions on shipments, we generally do not compete directly with integrated air cargo carriers such as United Parcel Service and FedEx Corporation in the overnight delivery of small parcels.
The table below summarizes the average weekly volume of freight moving through our network for each year since 2003.

 | Average Weekly

Purchased Transportation
Our licensed property broker places our customers’ cargo with qualified motor carriers, including our own, and other third-party transportation companies. Expedited LTL’s licensed motor carrier contracts with owner-operators for most of its transportation services. The owner-operators own, operate and maintain their own tractors and employ their own drivers. Our freight handlers load and unload our trailers and vehicles for hauling by owner-operators between our terminals.
We seek to establish long-term relationships with owner-operators to assure dependable service and availability. Historically, Expedited LTL has experienced significantly higher-than-industry average retention of owner-operators. Expedited LTL has established specific guidelines relating to safety records, driving experience and personal evaluations that we use to select our owner-operators. To enhance our relationship with the owner-operators, Expedited LTL seeks to pay rates that are generally above prevailing market rates and our owner-operators often are able to negotiate a consistent work schedule for their drivers. Usually, owner-operators negotiate schedules for their drivers that are between the same two cities or along a consistent route, improving quality of work life for the drivers of our owner-operators and, in turn, increasing our driver retention.
As a result of efforts to expand our logistics and other services, seasonal demands and volume surges in particular markets, we also purchase transportation from other surface transportation providers to handle overflow volume. Of the $254.9 million incurred for Expedited LTL's purchased transportation during 2017, we purchased 53.8% from the owner-operators of our licensed motor carrier and 46.2% from other surface transportation providers.

Other Services
Expedited LTL customers increasingly demand more than the movement of freight from their transportation providers. To meet these demands, we continually seek ways to customize and add new services.
Other Expedited LTL services allow customers to access the following services from a single source:

• | customs brokerage;


• | warehousing, dock and office space;


• | hotshot or ad-hoc ultra expedited services; and


• | shipment consolidation and handling, such as shipment build-up and break-down and reconsolidation of air or ocean pallets or containers.

Customers
Our wholesale customer base is primarily comprised of freight forwarders, third party logistics (“3PL”) companies, integrated air cargo carriers and passenger, cargo airlines and steamship lines. Expedited LTL’s freight forwarder customers vary in size from small, independent, single facility companies to large, international logistics companies. Our dependable service and wide-ranging service offerings also make Expedited LTL an attractive option for 3PL providers , which is one of the fastest growing segments in the transportation industry. Because we deliver dependable service, integrated air cargo carriers use our network to provide overflow capacity and other services, including shipment of bigger packages and pallet-loaded cargo. In 2017, LTL's ten largest customers accounted for approximately 31% of its operating revenue, but no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue.
Truckload Premium Services
Overview
Our TLS segment is an asset-light provider of transportation management services, including, but not limited to, expedited truckload brokerage, dedicated fleet services, as well as high security and temperature-controlled logistics services. We market our TLS services to integrated air cargo carriers, airlines, freight forwarders and LTL carriers, as well as life-science companies, and their distributors and other shippers of high value cargo. TLS offers long haul, regional and local services through a dedicated fleet and third party transportation providers. TLS also utilizes a wide assortment of equipment to meet our customers’ critical on-time expectations in the United States and Canada.
Operations
TLS’ primary operations are located in Columbus, Ohio. TLS also has satellite operations in South Bend, Indiana; Greeneville, Tennessee; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and Sacramento, California.

Transportation
TLS utilizes a dedicated fleet of owner-operators, company drivers and third party transportation providers in its operations. The owner-operators own, operate and maintain their own tractors and employ their own drivers. We also maintain a fleet of company drivers, which primarily services our life science and high value cargo customers. In many instances, our customers request team (driver) service. Through team service, we are able to provide quicker, more secure, transit service to our TLS customers. 
We seek to establish long-term relationships with owner-operators and company drivers to assure dependable service and availability. To enhance our relationship with the owner-operators and our company drivers, TLS strives to set its owner-operator and company driver pay rates above prevailing market rates.
TLS has established specific guidelines relating to safety records, driving experience and personal evaluations that we use to qualify and select our drivers (leased and employed). 
In addition to our owner-operators and company fleet, we also purchase transportation from other surface transportation providers (including Expedited LTL) to serve our customers’ needs. TLS’ brokerage operation has relationships with over 4,400 qualified carriers. Of the $143.0 million incurred for TLS transportation during 2017, we purchased 34.5% from the owner-operators of our licensed motor carrier, 8.2% from our company fleet and 57.3% from other surface transportation providers.
We have access to a pool of trailers and we utilize a variety of equipment in our TLS operations including dry van, refrigerated, and roller-bed trailers, as well as straight trucks and cargo vans. We service our life science and high-security cargo customers with industry-leading TAPA (Transported Asset Protection Association) Level 1 certified equipment that has layered security measures to prevent theft, qualified and calibrated refrigerated trailers, and temperature systems that minimize the chance of damage to cargo caused by temperature excursions. All of the TLS trailers have global positioning trailer-tracking technology that allows us to more effectively manage our trailer pool.
All of our TLS company and independent contractor tractors are equipped with in-cab communication devices, which enable us to communicate with our drivers, plan and monitor shipment progress and monitor and record our drivers’ hours of service. We use the real-time global positioning data obtained from these devices to improve customer and driver service. 
Customers
Our customer base is primarily comprised of freight forwarders, third party logistics companies, integrated air cargo carriers, passenger and cargo airlines, and LTL carriers, as well as retail, life-science companies, and their distributors. TLS’ customers include Fortune 500 pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors, as well as transportation companies. In 2017, TLS’ ten largest customers accounted for approximately 77% of its operating revenue but no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue.

Intermodal
Overview
Our Intermodal segment provides high value intermodal container drayage services. We market our Intermodal services to import and export customers. Intermodal offers first- and last-mile transportation of freight both to and from seaports and railheads through a dedicated fleet and third party transportation providers. Today, Intermodal operates primarily in the Midwest and Southeast, with a smaller presence in the Southwest. We plan to expand beyond our current geographic footprint through acquisitions as well as greenfield start-ups where no suitable acquisition is available. Intermodal also provides linehaul and local less-than-truckload service in the Midwest, as well as CFS warehousing services (e.g. devanning, unit load device build-up/tear-down, and security screening) for air and ocean import/export freight at five (5) of its Midwest terminals (Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Indianapolis and Detroit). Our Intermodal service differentiators include:

• | Immediate proof of delivery ("POD") and Signature Capture capability via tablets;


• | All drivers receive dispatch orders on hand-held units and are trackable via GPS; and


• | Daily contrainer visibility and per diem management reports.

Operations
Intermodal’s primary office is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. Intermodal’s network consists of terminals in the following locations:
                
City 
Atlanta, GA | Joliet, IL 
Charleston, SC | Kansas City, MO
Charlotte, NC | Memphis, TN 
Chicago/Joliet, IL | Milwaukee, WI 
Cincinnati, OH | Minneapolis, MN
Cleveland, OH | Nashville, TN 
Dallas, TX | Norfolk, VA 
Houston, TX | Rochelle, IL 
Indianapolis, IN | Romulus, MI 
Jacksonville, FL | Savannah, GA 

Transportation
Intermodal utilizes a mix of Company-employed drivers, owner-operators and third party carriers. During 2017, approximately 19.7% of Intermodal’s direct transportation expenses were provided by Company-employed drivers, 78.8% by owner-operators and 1.5% was provided by third party carriers.
All of our Intermodal company and independent contractor tractors are equipped with computer tablets, which enable us to communicate with our drivers, plan and monitor shipment progress and monitor our drivers’ hours of service. We use the real-time global positioning data obtained from these devices to improve customer and driver service and provide a high level of shipment visibility to our customers (including immediate POD signature capture). We believe that our technology is a key differentiator and enables us to provide a higher level of service than our competitors.
Customers
Intermodal’s customer base is primarily comprised of international freight forwarders, passenger and cargo airlines and steamship lines. In 2017, Intermodal’s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 31% of its operating revenue but no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue.

Pool Distribution
Overview
Our Pool Distribution (or “Pool”) segment provides pool distribution services through a network of terminals and service locations in 27 cities throughout the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest and Southwest United States. Pool distribution involves managing high-frequency handling and distribution of time-sensitive product to numerous destinations in specific geographic regions. We market these services to national and regional retailers and distributors.
Operations
Our Pool Distribution network consists of terminals and service locations in the following 27 cities:

* Denotes an independent agent station.
** Denotes a location in which Expedited LTL is an agent for Pool Distribution.
*** Denotes a location with combined Expedited LTL and Pool Distribution operations.
Transportation
Pool Distribution provides transportation services through a mix of Company-employed drivers, owner-operators and third party carriers. The mix of sources utilized to provide Pool transportation services is dependent on the individual markets and related customer routes. During 2017, approximately 37.0% of Pool's direct transportation expenses were provided by Company-employed drivers, 34.4% by owner-operators and 28.6% was provided by third party carriers.
Customers
Pool Distribution’s customer base is primarily composed of national and regional retailers and distributors. Pool’s three largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of Pool Distribution’s 2017 operating revenue, but revenues from these three customers do not exceed 10% of our consolidated revenue. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of Pool’s operating revenue.
Competition
We compete in the North American transportation and logistics services industry, and the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, very fragmented and historically have few barriers to entry. We compete with a large number of other asset-light logistics companies, asset-based carriers, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers. To a lesser extent, we also compete with integrated air cargo carriers and passenger airlines. Our competition ranges from small operators that compete within a limited geographic area to companies with substantially greater financial and other resources, including greater freight capacity.  
Our Expedited LTL, TLS and Pool Distribution segments primarily compete with other national and regional truckload carriers. Expedited LTL also competes with less-than-truckload carriers, and to a lesser extent, integrated air cargo carriers and 
 10

passenger and cargo airlines, while our TLS segment also competes with property brokers and 3PLs. Our Intermodal segment primarily competes with national and regional drayage providers. 
We believe competition in our segments is based primarily on quality service, available capacity, on-time delivery, flexibility, reliability and security, transportation rates, location of facilities and business relationships, and we believe we compete favorably with other transportation service companies. To that end, we believe our Expedited LTL segment has an advantage over other truckload and less-than-truckload carriers because Expedited LTL delivers faster, more reliable services between cities at rates that are generally significantly below the charge to transport the same shipments to the same destinations by air. We believe our TLS and Intermodal segments have a competitive advantage over other truckload carriers and drayage providers because we deliver faster, more reliable service while offering greater shipment visibility and security. Additionally, we believe our Intermodal segment is one of the leading providers of drayage and related services in North America today. We believe that our presence in several regions across the continental United States enables our Pool Distribution segment to provide consistent, high-quality service to our customers regardless of location, which is a competitive advantage over other pool distribution providers. 
Marketing
We market all of our services through a sales and marketing staff located in major markets of the United States. Senior management also is actively involved in sales and marketing at the national and local account levels. We participate in trade shows and advertise our services through direct mail programs and through the Internet via www.forwardaircorp.com, www.forwardair.com, www.forwardairsolutions.com, www.shiptqi.com, and www.cstruck.com. We market our services through all of our websites. The information contained on our websites is not part of this filing and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.
Seasonality
Historically, our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. The first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. Typically, this pattern has been the result of factors such as economic conditions, customer demand, weather and national holidays. Additionally, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers whose business levels are impacted by the economy. The impact of seasonal trends and the economy is more pronounced on our pool distribution business, whose operating revenues and results tend to improve in the third and fourth quarters compared to the first and second quarters.
Employees and Equipment
As of December 31, 2017, we had 3,857 full-time employees, 1,339 of whom were freight handlers. Also, as of that date, we had an additional 1,041 part-time employees, of whom the majority were freight handlers. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We recognize that our workforce, including our freight handlers, is one of our most valuable assets. The recruitment, training and retention of qualified employees are essential to support our continued growth and to meet the service requirements of our customers.
We manage a trailer pool that is utilized by all of our reportable segments to move freight through our networks. Our trailer pool includes dry van, refrigerated and roller-bed trailers, and substantially all of our trailers are 53 feet long. We own the majority of the trailers we use, but we supplement at times with leased trailers. At December 31, 2017, we had 5,680 owned trailers in our fleet with an average age of approximately 5.4 years. In addition, at December 31, 2017, we also had 784 leased trailers in our fleet. At December 31, 2017, we had 581 owned tractors and straight trucks in our fleet, with an average age of approximately 6.4 years. In addition, at December 31, 2017, we also had 383 leased tractors and straight trucks in our fleet.
Risk Management and Litigation
Under U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) regulations, we are liable for property damage and personal injuries caused by owner-operators and Company-employed drivers while they are operating on our behalf. Additionally, from time to time, the drivers employed and engaged by the third-party transportation carriers we contract with are involved in accidents, which may result in serious personal injuries. The resulting types and/or amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier. Although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees, owner-operators, or independent contractors working for carriers, from time to time, claims may be asserted against us for their actions, or for our actions in retaining them. We currently maintain liability insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to cover third-party claims. We have a self-insured retention of $1.0 million per occurrence for vehicle and general liability claims. We may also be subject to claims for workers’ compensation. We maintain workers’ compensation insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to cover such claims. We have a self-insured retention of approximately $0.4 million for 
 11

each such claim, except in Ohio, where we are a qualified self-insured entity with an approximately $0.5 million self-insured retention. We could incur claims in excess of our policy limits or incur claims not covered by our insurance.
From time to time, we are a party to litigation arising in the normal course of our business, most of which involve claims for personal injury, property damage related to the transportation and handling of freight, or workers’ compensation. We do not believe that any of these pending actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Regulation
We are regulated by various United States and state agencies, including but not limited to the DOT. These regulatory authorities have broad powers, generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations, as well as motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers, transportation of hazardous materials, certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting. The trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities, which address matters such as: increasingly stringent environmental, occupational safety and health regulations, limits on vehicle weight and size, ergonomics, port security, and hours of service. In addition, we are subject to compliance with cargo-security and transportation regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and our domestic customs brokerage operations are licensed by CBP. Additionally, our Canada business activities are subject to similar requirements imposed by the laws and regulations of Canada, as well as its provincial laws and regulations. Regulatory requirements, and changes in regulatory requirements, may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services.
