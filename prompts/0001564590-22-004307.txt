Customers
 Our customer base includes leading grocery stores, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, discount chains, dollar stores, drug stores, home improvement stores, military outlets and eCommerce retailers. We sell both branded and store brand products across our customer base. We generally sell our branded products pursuant to informal trading policies and our store brand products under one year or multi-year agreements. Walmart accounted for 29%, 30% and 30% and Sam’s Club accounted for 15%, 13% and 13% of our total net revenue in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Walmart and Sam’s Club are affiliated entities. Sales to Walmart are concentrated more heavily in our Hefty Waste & Storage segment, and sales to Sam’s Club are concentrated more heavily in our Hefty Tableware segment.
 During fiscal year 2021, sales in North America and the United States represented 99% and 98% of our total sales, respectively.
 Sales and Distribution
 Through our sales and marketing organization, we are able to manage our relationships with customers at the national, regional and local levels, depending on their needs. We believe that our dedicated sales representatives, category management teams and our participation in both branded and store brand products create a significant competitive advantage.
 We have a direct sales force organized by customer type, including national accounts, regional accounts and eCommerce. Our sales force is responsible for sales across each of our segments and our portfolio of branded and store brand products. We complement our internal sales platform by selectively utilizing third-party brokers for certain products and customers. In addition to sales professionals, each of our top 20 customers has a dedicated customer support team, including customer service representatives, category management teams and a logistics and transportation team.

We utilize two routes of distribution to deliver our products to our customers. In many cases, we ship directly from our warehouses to the customer distribution center. Given the breadth of our product offerings, we are also able to optimize truckloads and reduce inventory for our retail partners by shipping trucks from mixing centers filled with SKUs across all of our product categories. 
 Competition
 The U.S. household consumer products market is mature and highly competitive. Our competitive set consists of consumer products companies, including large and well-established multinational companies as well as smaller regional and local companies. These competitors include The Clorox Company, S.C. Johnson & Sons, Inc., Poly-America, Handi-Foil Corporation, Republic Plastics, Ltd., Trinidad Benham Corporation and Inteplast Group, Ltd. Within each product category, most of our products compete with other widely advertised brands and store brand products.
 Competition in our categories is based on a number of factors including price, quality and brand recognition. We benefit from the strength of our brands, a differentiated portfolio of quality branded and store brand products, as well as significant capital investment in our manufacturing facilities. We believe the strong recognition of the Reynolds brand and Hefty brand among U.S. consumers gives us a competitive advantage. In addition, our largest customers choose us for our customer service, category management services and commitment to “Made in the U.S.A.” products.
 Seasonality
 Portions of our business have historically been moderately seasonal. Overall, our strongest sales are in our fourth quarter and our weakest sales are in our first quarter. This is driven by higher levels of sales of cooking products around major U.S. holidays in our fourth quarter, primarily due to the holiday use of Reynolds Wrap, Reynolds Oven Bags and Reynolds Parchment Paper. Our tableware products generally have higher sales in the second quarter of the year, primarily due to outdoor summertime use of disposable plates, cups and bowls.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 We have a diverse supplier base, and are not reliant on any single supplier for our primary raw materials, including polyethylene, polystyrene and aluminum. We also purchase raw material additives, secondary packaging materials and finished products for resale. We source a significant majority of our resin requirements from domestic suppliers. We have a track record of actively managing and/or successfully passing along to customers raw material price fluctuations. 
 Centralized purchasing enables us to leverage the global purchasing power of our operations and reduces our dependence on any one supplier. We generally have one to two year contracts with resin and aluminum suppliers, which have historically provided us with a steady supply of raw materials. In certain instances, we purchase selected finished goods from third-party suppliers to supplement capacity and source specialty items. While we have not historically experienced significant interruptions from third party suppliers, we have seen increased delays in 2021 as a result of labor shortages and the timing of imports from third party suppliers.
 Intellectual Property
 We have a significant number of registered patents and registered trademarks, including Reynolds and Hefty, as well as several copyrights, which, along with our trade secrets and manufacturing know-how, help support our ability to add value within the market and sustain our competitive advantages. We have invested a considerable amount of resources in developing proprietary products and manufacturing capabilities, and we employ various methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employees and consultants, to protect our intellectual property. While in the aggregate our patents are of material importance to us, we believe that we are not dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.
 Other than licenses for commercially available software, we do not believe that any of our licenses from third parties are material to us taken as a whole. We do not believe that any of our licenses to intellectual property rights granted to third parties are material to us taken as a whole.
 Employees and Human Capital
 Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. Our talent management and succession plan process includes the identification of key positions based on current and future business strategies, the identification of potential successors, and a plan for talent development. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 5,600 people, most of whom are located in our U.S. and Canada manufacturing facilities. Approximately 24% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any significant union-related work stoppages over the last ten years. We believe our relationships with our employees and labor unions are satisfactory.

Environmental, Health & Safety:  We are committed to protecting the safety, health and security of our employees and that of the environments in which we operate.  We are firm in our policy that we will not compromise employee health and safety or the environment for profit or production. We are passionate about health and safety and pride ourselves on our strategy of prevention through proactive risk elimination and reduction. Our cross-functional leaders and team members work collaboratively to identify risks and to develop and implement control measures leveraging engineering solutions and new technology for mitigation. As a result, in 2021, we have managed to reduce the number of injuries year-over-year and have relatively low injury rates compared to others in our industry.  
 The COVID-19 pandemic continued to introduce an array of unprecedented challenges, but we responded with urgency to develop and adjust policies and protocols as needed to help prevent spread of the disease in our facilities, while continuing to operate as an essential business to serve our customers and consumers. The health and well-being of our workforce and of our families, as well as compliance with CDC guidelines and federal, state and local mandates, remain priorities for us. We persist with illness prevention measures including allowing remote work where feasible, encouraging those who are sick to stay home, adjusting work practices to facilitate physical distancing, mandating face coverings, restricting visitation and travel and educating employees about the disease, prevention, vaccines and resources available to assist with coping during these difficult times.
 Diversity, Equity & Inclusion: We believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive organization will enhance the sense of belonging for our colleagues, customers, consumers, shareholders and communities. We are committed to building a respectful workplace, educating our colleagues and integrating DE&I within our overall business strategy.  2021 was a significant year in our DE&I journey. As a result of feedback from our colleagues, we took several critical steps. We educated senior leaders on unconscious bias, completed our Dignity & Respect in the Workplace Survey and hosted listening circles to increase cross-cultural understanding. Respect is the foundation of our DE&I strategy, and we will continue to implement best practices, educate our colleagues on the importance of implementing DE&I strategies and promote a culture where all feel they belong.
 Talent Acquisition:  We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace environment in which individual differences are recognized, respected and appreciated. We provide job opportunities for growth in an exciting, dynamic and fast-paced workplace environment. We have made investments in our Talent Acquisition team to better enable us to source and recruit talent in today’s challenging labor market, and assist in a great candidate experience and a welcoming new hire onboarding. We have also created a comprehensive hourly recruiting strategy and social media plan for our plant locations, and have further invested in this area for a consistent approach as well as tools and resources to identify diverse talent.
Regulatory
 As many of our products are used in food packaging, our business is subject to regulations governing products that may contact food in all the countries in which we have operations. Future regulatory and legislative change can affect the economics of our business activities, lead to changes in operating practices, affect our customers and influence the demand for and the cost of providing products and services to our customers. We have implemented compliance programs and procedures designed to achieve compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and believe these programs and procedures are generally effective. However, because of the complexity of these laws and regulations and the multinational scope of our business, compliance cannot be guaranteed.
 We are subject to various national, state, local, foreign and international environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits. Among other things, these requirements regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes, protect the health and safety of our employees, regulate the materials used in and the recycling of our products and impose liability, which can be strict, joint and several, for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances related to our current and former sites, as well as at third party sites where we or our predecessors have sent hazardous waste for disposal. Many of our manufacturing facilities require environmental permits, such as those limiting air emissions. Compliance with these permits can require capital investment and, in some cases, could limit production.
 In addition, a number of governmental authorities, both in the United States and abroad, have considered, and are expected to consider, legislation aimed at reducing the amount of plastic waste. Programs have included banning certain types of products, mandating certain rates of recycling and/or the use of recycled materials, imposing deposits or taxes on plastic bags and packaging material and requiring retailers or manufacturers to take back packaging used for their products.
 Moreover, as environmental issues, such as climate change, have become more prevalent, governments have responded, and are expected to continue to respond, with increased legislation and regulation, which could negatively affect us. For example, the United States Congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency is regulating certain greenhouse gas emissions under existing laws such as the Clean Air Act. A number of states and local governments in the United States have also announced their intentions to implement their own programs to reduce greenhouses gases. These initiatives may cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental legislation or regulations, such as costs to upgrade or replace equipment, as well as increased indirect costs that could get passed through to us resulting from our suppliers and customers also incurring additional compliance costs.
