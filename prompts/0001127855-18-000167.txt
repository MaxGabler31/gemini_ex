ITEM 1.       BUSINESS
 
We are an exploration stage mineral company.  On May 3, 2013, our consulting geologist acquired a 100% legal and beneficial ownership interest in the MC00000266 mining claim (hereafter the "Claim") which was held in trust for us.  The Claim was located in the Northeast Athabasca Basin, in the Province of Saskatchewan, Canada.  It was located on provincial lands administered by the Province of Saskatchewan.  The legal and ownership rights on the claim were limited to the exploration and extraction of mineral deposits subject to applicable regulations.  The Claim totaled roughly 2,014 acres or 3.15 square miles in size and was located approximately 25 miles north of the community of Points North, Saskatchewan.
 
We were unable to raise the necessary funding to keep the mineral Claim in good standing and in May 2015, we forfeited our legal and beneficial ownership interest in the Claim for non-payment. As of November 30, 2017, we no longer held a beneficial interest in the Claim or any other mineral properties.
 
On November 20, 2017 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Great Northern Properties, Inc. ("GNP") for consideration of 250,000 shares of our restricted common stock valued at $5,000 ($0.02 per share), as well as promissory notes in the principal amount of $50,000, for total purchase price of $55,000. The promissory notes bear interest at 6% per year and are due and payable on October 31, 2022 or the sale of this property in Anchorage, Alaska, whichever is the first to occur.  As of November 20, 2017 and August 15, 2018, GNP's only asset was a parcel of undeveloped land in Anchorage, Alaska. We plan to build a triplex with 3 rental units, each of which will consist of approximately 1,200 sq. ft., on this property.
 
We did not have any employees as of August 15, 2018, other than Mark Rodenbeck who serves as our only Officer.   Mr. Rodenbeck does not receive any compensation for his services to us.
