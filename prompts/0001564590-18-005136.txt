General
 Our objective is to build a profitable and growing specialty therapeutics company.  To meet this objective, we have acquired and are developing two technology platforms that hold promise for treating millions of patients and represent significant potential for increasing shareholder value. Our current corporate activities fall substantially into advancing these platforms: Cytori Nanomedicine and Cytori Cell Therapy.
 The Cytori Nanomedicine platform features a versatile liposomal nanoparticle technology for drug encapsulation that has thus far provided the foundation to bring two promising drugs into mid/late stage clinical trials.  Nanoparticle encapsulation is promising because it can help improve the delivery and metabolism of many drugs, thus potentially enhancing the therapeutic profile and patient benefits.  Our lead drug candidate, ATI-0918 is a generic version of pegylated liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin.  Pegylated liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin is a heavily relied upon chemotherapeutic used in many cancer types on a global basis.  We believe that data from a 60-patient European study of ATI-0918 has met the statistical criteria for bioequivalence to Janssen’s Caelyx®, the current reference listed drug in Europe.  We intend that these bioequivalence data will serve as a basis for our planned regulatory submission to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for ATI-0918. We are currently evaluating our strategic options to bring ATI-0918 to the U.S., China, and other markets.  Our second nanomedicine drug candidate is ATI-1123, a novel and new chemical entity which is a nanoparticle-encapsulated form of docetaxel, also a workhorse chemotherapeutic drug used for many cancers.  A Phase I clinical trial of ATI-1123 has been completed and published, and we are investigating possible expansion of this 
 3 


trial to Phase II, most likely in conjunction with a development partner.  Finally, in connection with our acquisition of the ATI-0918 and ATI-1123 drug candidates, we have acquired know-how (including proprietary processes and techniques) and a scalable nanoparticle manufacturing plant in San Antonio, Texas from which we intend to manufacture commercial quantities of our nanoparticle drugs.
 Cytori Cell Therapy, or CCT, is based on the scientific discovery that the human adipose or fat tissue compartment is a source of a unique mixed population of stem, progenitor and regenerative cells that may hold substantial promise in the treatment of numerous diseases and conditions.  To bring this promise to health providers and their patients, we are developing novel therapies prepared and administered at the patient’s bedside with proprietary technologies that include therapy-specific reusable, automated, standardized Celution devices, single-use Celution consumable sets, Celase reagent, and Intravase reagent.  Our lead product candidate, Habeo™ Cell Therapy, was evaluated in a Cytori-sponsored U.S. randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center clinical trial, STAR (Scleroderma Treatment with Celution Processed Adipose Derived Regenerative Cells), for the treatment of impaired hand function in patients with scleroderma.  On July 24, 2017, we announced top-line, preliminary data and presented the full data analysis on October 18, 2017.  The STAR trial enrolled and evaluated 88 patients with scleroderma, including 51 patients within the diffuse cutaneous subset and 37 with limited cutaneous scleroderma.  While the primary and secondary endpoints did not reach statistical significance at 24 or 48 weeks, the trial data reported clinically meaningful improvement in the primary and secondary endpoints of both hand function and scleroderma-associated functional disability, for Habeo treated patients compared to placebo, in the pre-specified subgroup of patients with diffuse cutaneous scleroderma.  Further, on January 22, 2018, we announced the investigator-initiated and Cytori-supported SCLERADEC-II clinical trial in France using Habeo Cell Therapy completed its enrollment and data is anticipated in the second half of 2018. Additional CCT treatments are in various stages of development in the areas of urology, wounds, and orthopedics.  Further, our CCT platform is the subject of investigator-initiated trials conducted by our partners, licensees and other third parties, some of which are supported by us and/or funded by government agencies and other funding sources, detailed in an announcement on November 13, 2017.  Currently, we internally manufacture the Celution devices and consumables in the United States and the United Kingdom and source our Celase and Intravase reagents from a third-party supplier.  We are exploring contract manufacturing organization options for the Celution System to reduce overhead and product costs of goods sold.  We also have obtained regulatory approval to sell some of our CCT products, including our Celution devices and consumables and associated reagents, in certain markets outside the U.S.  In those markets, we have been able to further develop and improve our core technologies, gain expanded clinical and product experience and data, and generate sales.
 Development Pipeline
 Cytori Nanomedicine
 In February 2017, we completed our acquisition of the assets of Azaya Therapeutics, Inc., or Azaya, pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated January 26, 2017.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we acquired equipment and certain intellectual property, including a portfolio of investigational therapies and related assets, and assumed certain liabilities, from Azaya in exchange for the issuance of 1,173,241 of shares of our common stock in the amount of $2.3 million, assumption of approximately $1.8 million in Azaya’s payables, and the obligation to pay Azaya future milestones, earn-outs and licensing fees. The acquisition of Azaya brought two additional product candidates, ATI-0918 and ATI-1123, into the Cytori pipeline and we intend to develop and potentially commercialize both, most likely in conjunction with a commercial partner.
 
ATI-0918 is a complex generic formulation of the widely used oncology drug, Doxil®/Caelyx®, which is a pegylated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin and approved in the U.S. for ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, and Kaposi’s Sarcoma; and in the European Union for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, and Kaposi’s Sarcoma. The current approval pathway for ATI-0918 is to leverage existing bioequivalence data to Caelyx® for approval in the European Union and to demonstrate bioequivalence to Sun Pharma’s Lipodox®, the reference standard, in the U.S.  A study to demonstrate ATI-0918’s bioequivalence to Caelyx®, for purposes of EMA approval, has been completed and we intend for these data to serve as the basis for our submission of a marketing authorization application for ATI-0918 to the EMA. We are also making plans to perform a bioequivalence study of ATI-0918 compared against Lipodox® to serve as the basis for submission of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, for U.S. FDA approval. We currently anticipate that any U.S. bioequivalence trial for ATI-0918 would be funded by a development partner or licensee.
 ATI-1123 is a novel liposomal formulation of docetaxel.  Generic forms of docetaxel are currently FDA approved and marketed for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma, and hormone refractory prostate cancer.  Its side effects include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, and allergic reactions. There is currently no form of liposomal docetaxel approved or commercially available. There is a protein (albumin) bound form of a similar chemotherapeutic drug, paclitaxel known as Abraxane®, which demonstrated some clinical advantages to paclitaxel. ATI-1123 has shown promising results in preclinical animal models that suggest it may have superior qualities to docetaxel, including actions against some tumor types that are not amenable to treatment by docetaxel. A Phase I study of ATI-1123 has been completed and 
 4 


published (Cancer Chemother Pharmacol (2014) 74:1241–1250), in late stage refractory patients and has shown some activity in several tumor types (mostly stable disease). We are currently evaluating opportunities to bring ATI-1123 into Phase II studies in several indications, including small cell lung cancer, via potential development partner or licensee.
 Cytori Cell Therapy
 The primary near-term goal is for Habeo Cell Therapy to be the first cell therapy product approved for the treatment of impaired hand function in patients with scleroderma, through Cytori-sponsored and supported clinical development efforts. 
 In the U.S., the STAR clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single administration of Habeo Cell Therapy for impaired hand function in patients with scleroderma. The first sites for our STAR trial were initiated in July 2015 and final enrollment of 88 patients was completed in June 2016. As noted above, preliminary assessment of unblinded top-line data show that treatment of ADRC’s was safe and while not meeting the primary endpoint for all scleroderma patients, subjects with diffuse scleroderma appeared to exhibit clinically meaningful improvement in several parameters of both hand function and scleroderma-associated functional disability, for Habeo™ treated patients compared to placebo. In Europe, the investigator-initiated and Cytori-supported SCLERADEC-II (Subcutaneous Injection of Autologous Adipose Tissue-derived Stromal Vascular Fraction into the Fingers of Patients with Systemic Sclerosis) clinical trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single administration of Habeo Cell Therapy for impaired hand function in patients with scleroderma.  The first sites were initiated in October 2015 and final enrollment of 40 patients was completed in January 2018. Data is anticipated in the second half of 2018.
 In Japan, Cytori held an informal consultation meeting with the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, to discuss the feasibility of potential Habeo development strategies and clinical trial designs for a single approval trial based on the results from the U.S. STAR clinical trial.  Cytori believes that a single arm 20 patient clinical trial of Habeo Cell Therapy for diffuse scleroderma will be required to obtain approval.
 With respect to the remainder of our current CCT clinical pipeline:
  
• | In July 2015, a Japanese investigator-initiated study of ECCI-50 Cell Therapy in men with stress urinary incontinence, or SUI, following prostatic surgery for prostate cancer or benign prostatic hypertrophy, called ADRESU, received approval to begin enrollment from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, or MHLW. Details of the ADRESU trial protocol were published in 2017. The basis for initiating ADRESU was a previously completed pilot trial, with short-term results of 11 patients published in 2014 and long-term results of 14 patients presented in 2017. In February 2018, the ADRESU trial had over 90% enrolled. The Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, or AMED, has provided partial funding for the ADRESU trial.

• | We are developing DCCT-10 Cell Therapy for thermal burns under a contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority, or BARDA, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In April 2017, we received approval of an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to conduct a pilot clinical trial, RELIEF (Safety and Feasibility of Adipose Derived Regenerative Cells (ADRCs) in the Treatment of Deep Partial Thickness and Full Thickness Thermal Wounds), of DCCT-10 administered intravenously in up to 30 patients with thermal burn injuries at up to 10 U.S. institutions. In May 2017, we announced BARDA’s exercise of Option 2 of up to approximately $13.4 million to fund RELIEF. We initiated RELIEF in 2017 and anticipate that the first patient will be treated in the first half of 2018.

 In addition to our targeted therapeutic development, we have continued to commercialize our CCT technology under select medical device approvals, clearances and registrations to customers in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Japan and other regions. These customers are a mix of research customers evaluating new therapeutic applications of CCT and commercial customers, including our licensing partners, distributors, and end user hospitals, clinics and physicians, that use our Celution System mostly for treatment of patients in private pay procedures. In Japan, our largest commercial market, we gained increased utilization of our products in the private pay marketplace due to several factors, including increased clarity around the November 2014 Regenerative Medicine Law (implemented in November 2015 as it relates to regenerative medicine products like CCT) and we project that our sales of Celution consumable sets and market presence in Japan will continue to grow in 2018.  The sale of Celution devices and consumable sets, reagents, and ancillary products contribute a margin that partially offsets our operating expenses and will continue to play a role in fostering familiarity within the medical community with our technology. It also provides us with valuable product and customer feedback. 
 Scleroderma
 Scleroderma is a rare and chronic connective tissue disease generally classified as an autoimmune rheumatic disorder. An estimated 300,000 Americans have scleroderma, about one-third of whom have the systemic form of the disease, known as systemic sclerosis, or SSc. SSc is further sub-classified as diffuse cutaneous and limited cutaneous SSc. Diffuse subset tends to produce more severe manifestations with significant hand dysfunction and internal organ involvement. Diffuse scleroderma accounts for between one third 
 5 


and one half of all cases of systemic sclerosis. Women are affected four times more frequently than men and the condition is typically detected between the ages of 30 and 50. More than 90% of scleroderma patients are afflicted with hand involvement that is typically progressive and can result in chronic pain, blood flow changes and severe dysfunction. A small number of treatments are occasionally used off-label for hand scleroderma, but they do little to modify disease progression or substantially improve symptoms with some challenging side-effects. Current treatment options are directed at protecting the hands from injury and detrimental environmental conditions as well as the use of vasodilators.  When the disease is advanced, prostanoids, Endothelin-1 receptor antagonists, and immunosuppressants may be used but are often accompanied by side effects.  If these medications are unsuccessful, health providers may perform a sympathectomy to remove nerves to increase blood flow and decrease long-term pain.
 Some of the first scleroderma patients treated with Cytori Cell Therapy was through SCLERADEC I, a completed, investigator-initiated, 12-patient, open-label, Phase I pilot trial sponsored by Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Marseille, or AP-HM, in Marseille, France. The SCLERADEC-I trial received partial support from Cytori. The six-month results were published in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases in May 2014 and demonstrated approximately a 50 percent improvement at six months across four important and validated endpoints used to assess the clinical status in patients with scleroderma with impaired hand function. Two-year follow up data in the SCLERADEC I trial was presented at the Systemic Sclerosis World Congress in February 2016 and published in the journal Current Research in Translational Medicine in November 2016 and demonstrated sustained improvement in the following four key endpoints: the Cochin Hand Function Scale, or CHFS, the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire, Raynaud’s Condition Score, and hand pain, as assessed by a standard visual analogue scale. Further, on December 5, 2016, we released topline results for three-year follow-up data showing sustained benefits materially consistent with those shown in two-year data.
 In 2014, Drs. Guy Magalon and Brigitte Granel, under the sponsorship of AP-HM, submitted a study for review for a follow-up randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in France using Cytori Cell Therapy, partially supported by Cytori. The trial, named SCLERADEC II, received approval from the French government in April 2015. Enrollment of this trial commenced in October and the last patient treated was in January 2018. We anticipate data in the second half of 2018. Patients will be followed at six-month post-treatment and compared with placebo treated patients. The SCLERADEC II trial includes an open-label crossover arm in which patients originally randomized to the placebo arm may be eligible to be treated with their cryopreserved cells after the aforementioned six-month data have been analyzed and reviewed by an independent monitoring committee.  Eligible patients electing to receive treatment with these cryopreserved cells will be followed for both safety and efficacy for six months.
 Based on the results of SCLERADEC I, we initiated the STAR trial, a 48-week, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled pivotal clinical trial of 88 patients at 19 sites in the U.S. to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Habeo Cell Therapy for scleroderma patients with impaired hand function. The STAR trial used the CHFS, a validated measure of hand function, as the primary endpoint measured at 24 weeks and 48 weeks (approximately 6 and 12 months) after a single administration of Habeo Cell Therapy or placebo. Of the 88 patients enrolled in STAR, 51 had diffuse cutaneous scleroderma while 37 had the limited form of the disease. 
 On July 24, 2017, we announced top-line, preliminary data from the STAR trial. The results from the STAR Trial showed that that treatment of ADRC’s was safe and while not meeting the primary endpoint for all SSc patients, subjects with diffuse SSc appeared to exhibit clinically meaningful improvement in several hand parameters of both hand function and scleroderma-associated functional disability, for Habeo™ treated patients compared to placebo. We recently released a more detailed assessment of STAR Trial data at the World Scleroderma Congress this past February. Further, we anticipate feedback from our FDA pre-submission meeting later this quarter, which will provide us with a clearer picture of the optimal path forward with this therapy in the U.S.
 In November 2016, the US FDA Office of Orphan Products Development granted Cytori an orphan drug designation for cryopreserved or centrally processed Habeo for scleroderma. In April 2016, the European Commission, acting on the positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, issued orphan drug designation to a broad range of Cytori Cell Therapy formulations when used for the treatment of systemic sclerosis under Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products number EU/3/16/1643.
 Stress Urinary Incontinence
 Another therapeutic target under evaluation by Cytori, led by the University of Nagoya and three other sites and partially supported by the Japanese MHLW, is stress urinary incontinence in men following surgical removal of the prostate gland, which is based on positive data reported in a peer reviewed journal resulting from the use of ADRCs prepared by our Celution System. The ADRESU trial is a 45 patient, investigator-initiated, open-label, multi-center, single arm trial that was approved by the Japanese MHLW in July 2015 and is being led by both Momokazu Gotoh, MD, Ph.D., Professor and Chairman of the Department of Urology and Tokunori Yamamoto, MD, Ph.D., Associate Professor Department of Urology at University of Nagoya Graduate School of Medicine. ADRESU is based on promising pilot trial data published in the International Journal of Urology in 2014 and presented at the International Continence Society in 2017. The primary endpoint for the ADRESU trial will be the number of patients who experience reduction of urinary leakage volume (as measured by the weight of diaper pads used over 24 hours) 52 weeks after treatment. If the endpoint is successfully achieved, the data will be used to seek approval of Cytori Cell Therapy for this indication. Trial enrollment began in 
 6 


September 2015, and in February 2018, the trial is over 90% enrolled. Full enrollment is expected by the second quarter of 2018 with top-line results available in late 2018 or 2019. This clinical trial is primarily sponsored and funded by the Japanese government, including a grant provided by AMED.
 Cutaneous and Soft Tissue Thermal and Radiation Injuries
 We are also developing Cytori Cell Therapy, or DCCT-10, for the treatment of thermal burns. In the third quarter of 2012, we were awarded a contract by BARDA valued at up to $106 million to develop a medical countermeasure for thermal burns. The total award under the BARDA contract has been intended to support all clinical, preclinical, regulatory and technology development activities needed to complete the FDA approval process for use of DCCT-10 in thermal burn injury under a device-based pre-market authorization, or PMA, regulatory pathway and to provide preclinical data in burn complicated by radiation exposure. 
 Pursuant to this contract, BARDA initially awarded us approximately $4.7 million over the initial two-year base period to fund preclinical research and continued development of our Celution System to improve cell processing. In August 2014, BARDA determined that Cytori had completed the objectives of the initial phase of the contract, and exercised its first contract option in the amount of approximately $12 million. In December 2014 and September 2016, BARDA exercised additional contract options pursuant to which it provided us with $2.0 million and $2.5 million in supplemental funds, respectively. These additional funds supported continuation of our research, regulatory, clinical and other activities required for submission of an IDE request to the FDA for RELIEF, a pilot clinical trial using DCCT-10 for the treatment of thermal burns. In April 2017, we received approval of an IDE from the FDA to conduct a pilot clinical trial of CCT in patients with thermal burn injuries. This trial is referred to as the RELIEF clinical trial. In May 2017, we announced BARDA’s exercise of Option 2 of up to approximately $13.4 million to fund RELIEF. We initiated RELIEF in 2017 through amendments to our contract with BARDA, or the Amendments. We anticipate that the first patient will be treated in the first half of 2018.
 In accordance with the terms of the Amendments, BARDA will provide us with reimbursement of costs incurred, plus payment of a fixed fee, in the aggregate amount of up to approximately $13.4 million, or the Funding Amount.  We are responsible for further costs in excess of the Funding Amount, if any, to meet the objectives of the Pilot Trial. The Amendments also extend the term of the BARDA Agreement and the period of performance of Option 2 of the BARDA Agreement to November 30, 2020.

 Our Cytori Nanomedicine pipeline includes both early and late stage nanomedicine product candidates, patented liposomal encapsulated docetaxel (ATI-1123) and generic pegylated liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin (ATI-0918), respectively.  We are actively seeking regional and global partnerships with either leading pharmaceutical companies or wholesale distributors for both of these product candidates, with priority on ATI-0918 in Europe where a generic form of liposomal doxorubicin is neither approved nor available.
Cytori Cell Therapy
 We sell Celution cell processing systems, or Celution Systems, StemSource cell and tissue banking systems, or StemSource Systems, and surgical accessories and instrumentation to hospitals, clinics, physicians, researchers and other customers for commercial and research purposes, including performance of investigator-initiated studies. Our proprietary enzymatic reagents, which we market and sell under the brand names Celase and Intravase, are sold as part of our Celution Systems and StemSource Systems (with respect to Celase), or under certain circumstances, are sold separately. 
 
We sell our Celution and StemSource Systems through a combination of a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives, and licensees.  Our strategy is to grow and leverage our installed base of Celution and StemSource devices at cell processing facilities, clinics, hospitals and research labs to drive recurring sales of our proprietary consumable sets and gain valuable customer feedback.  To increase product familiarity and usage among current customers, we launch product enhancements, expand the approved indications for use, perform clinical and technical training, provide on-site case support, and facilitate facility-level licensing with regional and/or national regulatory bodies.
 
In Japan, we sell our products through our wholly owned subsidiary, Cytori Therapeutics, K.K., which has a direct sales capability.  We currently intend to increase our direct sales personnel in Japan over time.  In the Bahamas, Chile, Europe, South Korea, Russia and Vietnam, we sell our full product portfolio either directly to customers or through numerous third-party distributors.  In the U.S., we are limited to selling only research reagents and surgical accessories and instrumentation directly to 
 7 


customers.  Bimini Technologies, LLC, through its wholly owned subsidiary Kerastem Technologies, LLC, has a global exclusive license to sell our Celution cell processing systems for hair applications.  Lorem Vascular has an exclusive license to sell our full product portfolio in all fields of use, excluding hair applications, in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. We also have engaged with partners to potentially leverage Managed Access Programs (also known as early access program or named patient programs) in various locations. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had two individuals in our global marketing team responsible for market assessments and business plans, competitive intelligence, distribution strategy, product management, social media and websites, forecasting, pricing and reimbursement, customer communication, relationship management, events and trade shows, and service.  We create awareness of and demand for our products among physicians and researchers through digital advertising, e-marketing campaigns, webinars, pre-clinical and clinical publications, patient advocacy group partnerships, sales collateral, and industry and medical society meetings.
 As of December 31, 2017, we had two Cytori employees/contractors in our field service team responsible for providing Celution and StemSource installations, maintenance, training, troubleshooting, and hardware and software update/upgrade services to new and existing customers.  This team also initiates and closes sites participating in Cytori-sponsored clinical trials.
 For the year ended December 31, 2017, our sales were concentrated with respect to five direct customers, which comprised 68% of our product revenue recognized.  One licensee and one direct customer accounted for 77% of total outstanding accounts receivable (excluding receivables from BARDA) as of December 31, 2016.
 Customers and Partners
 In Japan, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America, we offer our Cytori Systems and StemSource Systems through direct sales representatives, distributors and licensing partners, to hospitals, clinics and researchers, including for purposes of performing investigator-initiated and funded studies.
 Pursuant to our Sale and Exclusive License/Supply Agreement with Bimini Technologies, LLC, or Bimini Agreement, we granted Bimini a global exclusive license to our Cytori Cell Therapy devices and consumable products for hair applications only, excluding systemic or intravascular delivery of adipose-derived regenerative cells, or ADRCs.  Hair loss affects more than 40 million men and 21 million women in the U.S. alone.  The global hair loss treatment market generates more than $7 billion annually and currently has limited options for men (grades I-III) and women (grades I-II) with early stage hair loss.  Through Kerastem, its wholly owned subsidiary, Bimini completed a FDA-approved Phase II multi-center, randomized, single-blinded, and controlled clinical trial in the U.S., called STYLE (A Trial of Cell Enriched Adipose For Androgenetic Alopecia), to study the safety and feasibility of Kerastem’s therapy for female and male pattern baldness. The Kerastem therapy is a one-time treatment that utilizes adipose (fat) derived regenerative cells combined with purified fat delivered to the affected area of scalp.  In September 2016, Bimini announced completion of its STYLE trial enrollment of 70 patients at four clinical trial sites within the U.S.  In December 2017, Bimini announced six-month top-line data from STYLE.  The low dose ADRC plus Puregraft fat treatment group achieved a statistically significant increase in mean terminal hair count, when compared to control, in men with early stage hair loss (Norwood Grades I-III). An average increase of 29 terminal hairs per cm2 of scalp was observed, corresponding to a 17% increase (p < 0.05) from baseline.  All treatment arms of STYLE were safe with no serious adverse events reported. Outside of the United States, Bimini is engaged in market development efforts in Europe and Japan for the hair market. The Kerastem Hair Therapy is CE mark approved in the EU for sales to patients with alopecia, or hair loss. Under the Bimini Agreement, Bimini is required, among other things, to pay an eight percent (8%) royalty on its net sales of our products for contemplated hair applications.
 Pursuant to our Amended and Restated License/Supply Agreement, or Lorem Agreement, with Lorem Vascular Pte. Ltd., or Lorem Vascular, we granted Lorem Vascular an exclusive license in all fields of use (excluding hair applications subject to Bimini’s license) to our Cytori Cell Therapy products for sale into China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia.  In April 2015, Cytori and Lorem Vascular announced that China Food and Drug Administration had granted regulatory clearance to the Celution System.  Under the Lorem Agreement, Lorem Vascular committed to pay up to $500 million in license fees in the form of revenue milestones. In addition, Lorem Vascular is required to pay Cytori 30% of their gross profits in China, Hong Kong and Malaysia for the term of the Lorem Agreement.  Lorem Vascular has certain minimum product purchase obligations, including purchase obligations triggered by achievement of applicable regulatory clearance for our products in China, which regulatory clearance was achieved as of April 2015.  Lorem Vascular has partially satisfied these related product purchase obligations, and as a result, we are currently in discussions with Lorem Vascular regarding restructuring of its obligations and our rights under the Lorem agreement.  We cannot guarantee that our restructuring discussions with Lorem Vascular will be successful.  Should we be unable to conclude these negotiations to our satisfaction, a dispute may ensue.  See, also, our discussions of the regulatory landscape in China for our products as well as discussions regarding our relationship with Lorem Vascular in the “Risk Factors” section and in the “Competition” and “Governmental Regulation” sections of this “Business” section below.

Manufacturing
 Cytori Nanomedicine
 We are in the process of obtaining facility validations at our recently acquired nanoparticle manufacturing facility located in San Antonio, Texas.   Once validation is complete, the facility and processes are designed to comply with cGMP per FDA and EMA regulations to manufacture drug candidates for clinical, research, development and commercial use. Upon approval of our drug candidates, our manufacturing capabilities will include validated manufacturing processes for drug product as well as a quality assurance product release process with the ability to ultimately scale-up the process to meet increasing market demands. We believe our strategic investments in the analytical and manufacturing capabilities, including personnel from drug discovery through drug development, will allow us to advance our product candidates more quickly. Expertise gained in manufacturing ATI-0918 may be applied to other formulations in the future, further leveraging our capabilities. Our San Antonio facility enables us to produce drug substance in a cost-effective manner while retaining control over the process and timing. As needed, the use of a qualified Clinical Manufacturing Organization may be utilized to perform various manufacturing processes as we deem appropriate to meet our operational objectives.
 Our current principal suppliers for our Cytori Nanomedicine business are LGM Pharma, which supplies our active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API (doxorubicin HC1), as well as Lipoid, LLC and Dishman Netherlands, B.V., which supply us with other raw materials used in the manufacture of our ATI-0918 and ATI-1123 drug candidates.  Each of these suppliers is currently a sole source supplier.
 Cytori Cell Therapy
 We currently manufacture Celution Systems in our headquarters in San Diego, California. As a part of our September 2017 corporate restructuring, we are in the process of consolidating manufacturing of our disposable systems to a single third party manufacturer. We have sufficient inventory on hand to meet global demand while we execute and complete our outsourcing plan. As a manufacturer, our products are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and distribution partners. Manufacturers of devices and products for human use are subject to regulation and inspection from time to time by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, as well as equivalent requirements and inspections by state and non-U.S. regulatory authorities, such as Notified Bodies in Europe and the California Food and Drug Branch.
 Raw materials for the Celution device, Celution consumable kit and other products are sourced from a variety of suppliers. Most of these components are available from multiple vendors either as off-the-shelf items or as custom fabrication.  However, we purchase our Celase and Intravase regents exclusively from Roche Diagnostics Corporation, or Roche.  While we have significant inventory of these reagents in inventory, we do not have a second source to provide us with these reagents should our supply arrangement with Roche terminate or be suspended, or should Roche be unable to meet its supply obligations thereunder.
 Competition
 We compete primarily on the basis of the safety and efficacy of our therapies across a broad range of clinical indications to address significant unmet medical and market needs, supported by our brand name, pricing, products, published clinical data, regulatory approvals, and reimbursement.  We believe that our continued success depends on our ability to:

Our ATI-1123 product candidate is expected to face competition from both Sanofi’s Taxotere, which is approved for 11 indications and available in 90 countries with a majority of sales from China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and generic docetaxel which is available from major suppliers in the U.S., Europe and Japan including, but not limited to, Accord, Actavis, Dr. Reddy’s Labs, GLS Pharma, Hospira, Sun Pharma, Teva, and Winthrop.  Further competition may result from advances made by companies currently developing nanoparticle-docetaxel products including, but not limited to, Adocia, Cristal Therapeutics, Merrimack, and Oasmia Pharmaceutical. 
 Cytori Cell Therapy
 According to the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, there over 700 companies worldwide and 801 clinical trials underway within the global regenerative medicine market.  Per Allied Market Research, this market is projected to reach $30.2 billion by 2022 and to be dominated by the cell therapy segment. 
 
Today, we compete directly against companies within the autologous adipose-derived cell therapy segment offering manual, semi-automated, or full automated cell processing and/or banking systems used with or without tissue dissociation reagents.  Our primary competitors include, but are not limited to, Adisave, Biosafe Group, GID Group, Healeon Medical, Human Med AG, InGeneron, Medikan International, PNC International, SERVA Electrophoresis GmbH, and Tissue Genesis.  None of these companies are conducting clinical trials for the treatment of hand dysfunction in scleroderma patients.  However, they are engaged in a number of clinical trials around the world.

 A study published in 2016 reported that there were 570 medical clinics in the U.S. advertising and offering stem cell treatments, including those derived from adipose tissue, directly to patients.  It is unclear whether the FDA will allow these clinics to continue to operate in this fashion and whether they will pose a threat to our business if and at such time that we obtain PMA approval to commercialize Habeo Cell Therapy in the U.S. 
 In the future, we also anticipate encountering competition from companies developing and offering drugs for the treatment of scleroderma including, but not limited to, Actelion Pharmaceuticals, Allergan, Apricus Biosciences, Bayer, Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Covis Pharma, CSL Behring, Genentech, and United Therapeutics.  No companies today have approved drugs indicated for improving hand function in scleroderma patients while only Tracleer® (Bosentan) is approved in Europe for the prevention of new digital ulcers in scleroderma patients.  Habeo Cell Therapy is expected to compete with or be used in conjunction with second and/or third line therapies including, but not limited to, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, botulinum toxin A, angiotensin II receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, alpha blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, topical nitrates, IV prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists, immunosuppressants, and surgical interventions.
 Research and Development
 Research and development expenses were $11.7 million and $16.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  These expenses have supported the basic research, product development and clinical activities necessary to bring our products to market.
 11 


Our research and development efforts in 2017 focused predominantly on the following areas:
  
• | Completion of enrollment in the STAR (hand manifestation of scleroderma) trial and data analysis and trial close out costs related to our previous conducted Phase IIACT-OA (knee osteoarthritis) trial;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continued optimization and development of the Celution System family of products and next-generation devices, single-use consumables and related instrumentation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, including the Celution System product platform, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, licensing agreements and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our success also depends, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing patents issued to others. If we were judicially determined to be infringing on any third-party patent, we could be required to pay damages, alter our products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities.
 To protect our proprietary medical technologies, including the Celution System platform and other scientific discoveries, we have a portfolio of over 100 issued patents worldwide. We currently have 34 issued U.S. patents and 68 issued international patents. Of the 34 issued U.S. patents, eight were issued in 2017. Of the 68 issued international patents, seven were issued in 2017. In addition, we have over 45 patent applications pending worldwide related to our Cytori Cell Therapy and Nanomedicine technologies. We are seeking additional patents on methods and systems for processing adipose-derived stem and regenerative cells, on the use of adipose-derived stem and regenerative cells for a variety of therapeutic indications, including their mechanisms of action, on compositions of matter that include adipose-derived stem and regenerative cells, and on other scientific discoveries. Regarding our Cytori Nanomedicine program, as part of our asset acquisition transaction with Azaya Therapeutics, we acquired Azaya Therapeutics’ patent portfolio consisting of two issued patents, one pending patent application and valuable proprietary liposome manufacturing know-how. Since the Azaya asset acquisition, we have filed one patent application relating to Cytori Nanomedicine, and intend to actively continue to enhance our nanomedicine portfolio.
We cannot assure that any of our pending patent applications will be issued, that we will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable, that any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by any third parties or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology. Furthermore, we cannot assure that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of our products or design around our patents. U.S. patent applications are not immediately made public, so we might be surprised by the grant to someone else of a patent on a technology we are actively using.
 There is a risk that any patent applications that we file and any patents that we hold or later obtain could be challenged by third parties and declared invalid or infringing of third party claims. For many of our pending applications, patent interference proceedings may be instituted with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, when more than one person files a patent application covering the same technology, or if someone wishes to challenge the validity of an issued patent. At the completion of the interference proceeding, the USPTO will determine which competing applicant is entitled to the patent, or whether an issued patent is valid. Patent interference proceedings are complex, highly contested legal proceedings, and the USPTO’s decision is subject to appeal. This means that if an interference proceeding arises with respect to any of our patent applications, we may experience significant expenses and delay in obtaining a patent, and if the outcome of the proceeding is unfavorable to us, the patent could be issued to a competitor rather than to us.  Third parties can file post-grant proceedings in the USPTO, seeking to have issued patent invalidated, within nine months of issuance. This means that patents undergoing post-grant proceedings may be lost, or some or all claims may require amendment or cancellation, if the outcome of the proceedings is unfavorable to us. Post-grant proceedings are complex and could result in a reduction or loss of patent rights. The institution of post-grant proceedings against our patents could also result in significant expenses.
 12 


Patent law outside the United States is uncertain and in many countries, is currently undergoing review and revisions. The laws of some countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Third parties may attempt to oppose the issuance of patents to us in foreign countries by initiating opposition proceedings. Opposition proceedings against any of our patent filings in a foreign country could have an adverse effect on our corresponding patents that are issued or pending in the United States. It may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors’ patents that have been issued in countries other than the United States. This could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We currently have pending patent applications or issued patents in Europe, Brazil, Mexico, India, Russia, Australia, Japan, Canada, China, Korea and Singapore, among others.
 In addition to patent protection, we rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. We cannot assure you that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent techniques, somehow gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise or disclose such trade secrets, or that we can ultimately protect our rights to such unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. We rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our marketing partners, employees, advisors, vendors and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
 Government Regulation – Nanoparticle Oncology Drugs
 Our nanoparticle oncology drug products must receive regulatory approvals from the EMA and the FDA and from other applicable governments prior to their sale. 
 Our current and future nanoparticle oncology drugs are, or will be, subject to stringent government regulation in the United States by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA regulates the design/development process, clinical testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, sale, distribution, and promotion of oncology drugs. Included among these regulations are drug approval requirements and the current Good Manufacturing Practices, cGMP. Other statutory and regulatory requirements govern, among other things, cGMP inspection, prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration, labeling and post-market reporting. The recent CURES Act legislation regarding drugs in the United States has yet to be implemented and may yield additional regulatory requirements on therapeutic drugs while providing some relief in selected regulatory burdens. The FDA’s interpretation and implementation of the CURES Act has yet to be published.  
 Our nanoparticle oncology drugs must also comply with the government regulations of each individual country in which the products are to be distributed and sold. These regulations vary in complexity and can be as stringent, and on occasion even more stringent, than FDA regulations in the United States. International government regulations vary from country to country and region to region. For instance, our ATI-0918 drug candidate relies on an expedited approval process referred to as ‘bioequivalence’ or BE approved under an ANDA.  ANDA and BE products require a ‘reference drug’, ‘reference standard’, or RS, and/or ‘reference listed drug’, or RLD, to with which to show equivalence. The reference drug may not be the same in all territories or countries, which could require different and unique BE clinical studies for some territories. Furthermore, the level of complexity and stringency is not always precisely understood today for each country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process. Additionally, government regulations can change with little to no notice and may result in the elimination of the BE regulatory pathway in some regions, creating increased regulatory burden.
 Worldwide, the regulatory process can be lengthy, expensive, and uncertain with no guarantee of approval. Before any new drugs may be introduced to the U.S. market, the manufacturer generally must obtain FDA approval through either ANDA process for generic drugs off patent that allow for bioequivalence to and existing reference listed drug, or the lengthier new drug approval (NDA) process, which typically requires multiple successful Phase III clinical trials to generate clinical data supportive of safety and efficacy along with extensive pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic preclinical testing to demonstrate safety. Approval of an ANDA could take four or more years from the time the development process is initiated due to the requirement for clinical trials. NDA drugs could take significantly longer due to the additional preclinical requirements along with the typical requirement for two successful Phase III clinical trials. 
 Our lead ATI-0918 drug candidate is eligible for the ANDA regulatory pathway in the U.S., while our ATI-1123 drug candidate is subject to the significantly lengthier NDA process. Changes to the RS and RLD for drugs eligible for the ANDA process can result in significant delays in the regulatory process as BE clinical studies may need to be repeated for regions / countries that no longer recognize the RS or RLD utilized in BE clinical studies.  Failure to comply with applicable requirements can result in application integrity proceedings, fines, recalls or seizures of products, injunctions, civil penalties, total or partial suspensions of production, withdrawals of existing product approvals, refusals to approve new applications or notifications, and criminal prosecution.
 13 


Drugs are also subject to post-market reporting requirements for deaths or serious injuries when the drug may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury, or serious adverse events.  If safety or effectiveness problems occur after the drug reaches the market, the FDA may take steps to prevent or limit further marketing of the drug.  Additionally, the FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing and promotion of drugs for indications or uses that have not been approved by the FDA.  
 We must comply with extensive regulations from foreign jurisdictions regarding safety, manufacturing processes and quality. These regulations, including the requirements for marketing and authorization, may differ from the FDA regulatory scheme in the United States.
 Government Regulation – Medical Devices
 As a specialty therapeutics company, we operate under stringent regulations and our companies and products are subject to a variety of distinct regulations around the world that are subject to modification or change.
Cytori Cell Therapy
 Cytori Cell Therapy technology is regulated through a variety or agencies and approaches around the world. Our products must receive regulatory clearances or approvals from regulatory bodies such as the EMA in the European Union, the FDA in the U.S., PMDA and MHLW in Japan, and the China Food and Drug Administration in China and from other applicable governments prior to their sale or in some cases prior to clinical trials. This technology platform incorporates multiple elements including devices, reagents and software that in combination yield an autologous cellular product. As a result of the complex nature of our products and differing regulations through the world, there is no single unified of global set of regulatory requirements or common approach to regulation and is therefore region specific.
 Cytori Cell Therapy technology is, and will be, subject to stringent government regulation in the United States by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA regulates the design/development process, clinical testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, sale, distribution and promotion of medical devices and drugs. Included among these regulations are pre-market clearance and pre-market approval requirements, design control requirements, and the requirements to comply with Quality System Regulations/Good Manufacturing Practices. Other statutory and regulatory requirements govern, among other things, registration and inspection, medical device listing, prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration, labeling and post-market reporting. In the U.S., we must currently obtain FDA clearance or approval through the PMA application process, which requires clinical trials to generate clinical data supportive of safety and efficacy. Approval of a PMA could take four or more years from the time the process is initiated due to the requirement for clinical trials. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can result in application integrity proceedings, fines, recalls or seizures of products, injunctions, civil penalties, total or partial suspensions of production, withdrawals of existing product approvals or clearances, refusals to approve or clear new applications or notifications, and criminal prosecution.
 Recently, the U.S. government enacted the 21st Century Cures Act, or the CURES Act, in the United States that has many provisions that could be favorable for us. However, the provisions of the CURES Act are broad and lack enough detail currently to determine its effect on our regulatory pathway. Further interpretation and implementation of the CURES Act must occur before any definitive assessments can be made.  
 Outside the U.S., the Cytori Cell Therapy family of products must also comply with the government regulations of each individual country in which the products are to be distributed and sold. These regulations vary in complexity and can be as stringent, and on occasion even more stringent, than FDA regulations in the United States. International government regulations vary from country to country and region to region. For example, regulations in some parts of the world only require product registration while other regions/countries require a complex product approval process. Due to the fact that there are new and emerging cell therapy and cell banking regulations that have recently been drafted and/or implemented in various countries around the world, the application and subsequent implementation of these new and emerging regulations have little to no precedent. Furthermore, the level of complexity and stringency is not always precisely understood today for each country, creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process. Furthermore, government regulations can change with little to no notice and may result in up-regulation of our products, thereby, creating a greater regulatory burden for our cell processing and cell banking technology products.
 In Europe, Cytori Cell Therapy is CE Mark approved as the Celution device and consumable product and is sold for commercial and research use. Expansion of use of Cytori Cell Therapy in Europe will likely require an expansion of our regulatory claims that would likely include disease-specific claims obtained through the completion of clinical trials. It is possible that Cytori Cell Therapy may be regulated as a device, similar to its regulatory pathway in the U.S., or as an advanced tissue medicinal product or ATMP, or some combination of the two in Europe. Cytori is currently working with both European authorities and country-specific competent authorities to clarify the proper path for Cytori’s Habeo Cell Therapy in Europe.
 14 


Regulations in the Asia-Pacific and Japan regions are currently evolving for cell therapy products.  For example, the Japan Diet enacted a regenerative medicine law in November of 2014 following sweeping changes in Japan’s medical device regulations in 2014.  In China, the regulatory landscape for cell therapies such as ours is subject to increasing regulation, and success in this market will depend heavily on a firm understanding of applicable regulations and a commitment to pursuing appropriate regulatory approvals, including any required approvals from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People’s Republic of China, and other governmental entities. These regulatory uncertainties further complicate the regulatory process in the Asia-Pacific region and may lengthen approval timelines and/or market entrance or penetration.
 Regulatory Developments
 EU Orphan Designation
 In April 2015, the European Commission, acting on the positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, granted an orphan drug designation to Assistance Publique Hopitaux du Marseille (France), the sponsor institution for the SCLERADEC I and SCLERADEC II trials using Cytori Cell Therapy, for the treatment of systemic sclerosis.
 In April 2016, the European Commission, acting on the positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, granted orphan drug designation to a broad range of Cytori Cell Therapy formulations when used for the treatment of systemic sclerosis under Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products number EU/3/16/1643.
 In November 2016, the U.S. FDA Office of Orphan Products Development granted Cytori an orphan drug designation for cryopreserved or centrally processed ECCS-50 Habeo for scleroderma.

 Item 1. Financial Statements
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
Shareholders and Board of Directors
Cytori Therapeutics, Inc.
 San Diego, California
 
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cytori Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company”) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern Uncertainty
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
Basis for Opinion
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

CYTORI THERAPEUTICS, INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 DECEMBER 31, 2017
  
1. | Organization and Operations
---+----------------------------

The Company
 Cytori Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CYTX) is a therapeutics company developing regenerative and oncologic therapies from its proprietary cell therapy and nanoparticle platforms for a variety of medical conditions. The Company’s primary focus on bringing its lead nanoparticle product candidate, ATI-0918, to the European market and the development of its cell therapies for impaired hand function in scleroderma, in addition to our other pipeline areas, such as osteoarthritis of the knee, stress urinary incontinence, and full thickness thermal burns including those complicated by radiation exposure.
Principles of Consolidation
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
 The Company has five wholly-owned subsidiaries located in Japan, United Kingdom, Switzerland, India and Spain that have been established primarily to support our sales and marketing activities in these regions.
Reverse Stock Split
 On May 10, 2016, following stockholder and Board approval, an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, was filed and declared effective, which Amendment effectuated a one-for-fifteen (1:15) reverse stock split of the Company’s (i) outstanding common stock, and (ii) common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants and options (the “1:15 Reverse Stock Split”).  Upon effectiveness of the 1:15 Reverse Stock Split, the number of shares of the Company’s common stock (x) issued and outstanding decreased from approximately 200 million shares (as of May 10, 2016) to approximately 13.3 million shares; (y) reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants and options decreased from approximately 16 million shares to approximately 1.1 million shares, and (z) reserved but unallocated under our current equity incentive plans (including the stockholder-approved share increase to the Company’s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan) decreased from approximately 6.5 million common shares to approximately 0.4 million common shares. In connection with the 1:15 Reverse Stock Split, the Company also decreased the total number of its authorized shares of common stock from 290 million to 75 million. The number of authorized shares of preferred stock remained unchanged. Following the 1:15 Reverse Stock Split. The Company adjusted stockholders’ equity to reflect the 1:15 Reverse Stock Split by reclassifying an amount equal to the par value of the shares eliminated by the split from common stock to the additional paid-in capital during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, resulting in no net impact to stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s shares of common stock commenced trading on a split-adjusted basis on May 12, 2016. Proportional adjustments for the reverse stock split were made to the Company's outstanding stock options, warrants and equity incentive plans for all periods presented.
Certain Risks and Uncertainties
 Our prospects are subject to the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development and commercialization, especially those companies in rapidly evolving and technologically advanced industries such as the biotech/medical device field. Our future viability largely depends on our ability to complete development of new products and receive regulatory approvals for those products. No assurance can be given that our new products will be successfully developed, regulatory approvals will be granted, or acceptance of these products will be achieved. The development of medical devices for specific therapeutic applications is subject to a number of risks, including research, regulatory and marketing risks. There can be no assurance that our development stage products will overcome these hurdles and become commercially viable and/or gain commercial acceptance.
Liquidity and Going Concern
 We incurred net losses of $22.7 million and $22.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  We have an accumulated deficit of $401.7 million as of December 31, 2017.  Additionally, we have used net cash of $18.1 million and $19.5 million to fund our operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company does not have sufficient capital to fund operations through one year from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 70


Further, the Loan and Security Agreement, with Oxford Finance, LCC (“Oxford”), as further described in Note 8, requires maintaining a minimum of $1.5 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand to avoid an event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement. Based on our cash and cash equivalents on hand of approximately $9.6 million at December 31, 2017,  the Company estimates that it will need to raise additional capital and/or obtain a waiver or restructure the Loan and Security Agreement in the near term to avoid defaulting under our $1.5 million minimum cash/cash equivalents covenant.
 
To date, these operating losses have been funded primarily from outside sources of invested capital including our recently completed underwritten public offering, Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park”) and the 2016 and 2017 Rights Offerings (each defined below), our at-the-market (“ATM”) equity facility, the Loan and Security Agreement and gross profits.  We have had, and we will likely continue to have, an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our future clinical development programs and other operations. Our inability to raise additional cash will have a material and adverse impact on operations and will cause us to default on our loan.
 On June 15, 2016, we closed a rights offering originally filed under Form S-1 registration statement in April 2016. Pursuant to the 2016 Rights Offering (as defined below in Note 11), we sold an aggregate of 6,704,852 units consisting of a total of 6,704,852 shares of common stock and 3,352,306 warrants, with each warrant exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $3.06 per share, resulting in total gross proceeds to Cytori of $17.1 million. See Note 11 for further discussion on the 2016 Rights Offering.
 On December 22, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement and a registration rights agreement, with Lincoln Park pursuant to which we have the right to sell to Lincoln Park and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $20.0 million of shares of the Company’s common stock over the 30-month period following March 31, 2017, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. See Note 11 for further discussion on the Lincoln Park agreement.
 On April 11, 2017, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”) relating to the issuance and sale of 8.6 million shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The price to the public in the offering was $1.10 per share. Maxim agreed to purchase the shares from us pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement at a price of $1.0395 per share. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $8.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses incurred by the Company. The offering closed on April 17, 2017. In addition, under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, we granted Maxim a 45-day option to purchase up to 944,000 additional shares of common stock. On May 31, 2017, Maxim exercised its option and purchased 849,000 shares at $1.10 per share. The net proceeds to us were $0.8 million, after deducting underwriting costs and offering expenses incurred by us.
 On September 5, 2017, we received a written notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, we no longer meet the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until March 5, 2018, in which to regain compliance. We were granted an additional compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until September 4, 2018, in which to regain compliance after meeting the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and providing notice to Nasdaq of our intent to cure the deficiency during this second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.  In order to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this 180-day period. 
 On November 28, 2017, we closed a rights offering originally filed under a Form S-1 registration statement in August 2017 (“2017 Rights Offering”). Pursuant to the 2017 Rights Offering, the Company sold an aggregate of 10,000 units consisting of a total of 10,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, immediately convertible into approximately 30,000,000 shares of common stock and 18,000,000 warrants, with each warrant exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.3333 per share, resulting in total net proceeds to the Company of $8.8 million. These warrants only become exercisable upon stockholder approval.
 We continue to seek additional capital through product revenues, strategic transactions, including extension opportunities under our awarded U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) contract, and from other financing alternatives. Without additional capital, current working capital and cash generated from sales will not provide adequate funding for research, sales and marketing efforts and product development activities at their current levels. If sufficient capital is not raised, we will at a minimum need to significantly reduce or curtail our research and development and other operations, and this could negatively affect our ability to achieve corporate growth goals.
 Should we be unable to raise additional cash from outside sources, this will have a material adverse impact on our operations.
 71


The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to its ability to continue as a going concern.
Reclassifications
 Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to certain of the prior years’ consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.
  
2. | Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
---+-------------------------------------------

Use of Estimates
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Our most significant estimates and critical accounting policies involve recognizing revenue, reviewing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, determining the assumptions used in measuring share-based compensation expense, measuring expense related to our in-process research and development acquisition, and valuing allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves.
 Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management’s estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods they are determined to be necessary.
 Cash and cash equivalents
 We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
 Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in readily available checking and savings accounts. We held no investments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.  We maintain our cash at insured financial institutions.
 Restricted Cash 
 Restricted cash consists of cash invested in certificate of deposits used as collateral for the issuance of letters of credit pursuant to lease agreements for leasing of property at 3020 and 3030 Callan Road, San Diego, CA, which requires us to execute a letter of credit for $0.2 million naming the landlord as a beneficiary as of December 31, 2017. In addition, in connection with the new lease (see Note 7) we executed in 2017, we issued a letter of credit in favor of that landlord in the amount of $0.5 million, which will remain in effect for the term of the lease.
Accounts Receivable
 Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company periodically assesses the collectability of accounts receivable on a specific customer basis considering factors such as evaluation of collectability, historical collection experience, the age of accounts receivable and other currently available evidence of the collectability, and records an allowance for doubtful accounts for the estimated uncollectible amount. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.
Inventories
 Inventories include the cost of material, labor, and overhead related to Celution devices, consumable kits, and reagents, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value.  We periodically evaluate our on-hand stock and make appropriate provisions for any stock deemed excess or obsolete.  Manufacturing costs resulting from lower than “normal” production levels are expensed as incurred.
Property and Equipment
 Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense, which includes the amortization of capitalized leasehold improvements, is provided for on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter, and range from three to five years. When assets are sold or otherwise 
 72


disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is included in operations. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.
 Impairment
 We assess certain of our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill, for potential impairment when there is a change in circumstances that indicates carrying values of assets may not be recoverable. Such long-lived assets are deemed to be impaired when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset (or asset group) are less than the asset’s carrying amount. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating expense.  We recognized no impairment losses during any of the periods presented in these financial statements.
Goodwill and Intangibles
 Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We perform our impairment test annually during the fourth quarter. As the Company operates in a single operating segment and reporting unit, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If, after assessing qualitative factors, the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. If deemed necessary, a two-step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is considered not impaired; otherwise, there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired and the amount of the loss, if any, is measured by performing step two. Under step two, the impairment loss, if any, is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. There was no indication of impairment of goodwill for all periods presented.
 Separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives.
 
As part of the May 2013 acquisition of the Joint Venture (see Note 3), we acquired intangible assets which consisted primarily of contractual license rights that had previously enabled the Joint Venture to conduct development and manufacturing activities pertaining to certain aspects of Cytori’s Celution technology.  The useful life of the identifiable intangible assets was estimated based on the assumed future economic benefit expected to be received from the assets. The technology was valued at $9.4 million and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful life of eleven years, commensurate with the expected cash flows. The amortization expense was $1.2 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The estimated aggregate amortization expense will be $1.2 million per year from for 2018 through 2022, and $0.9 million thereafter. Accumulated amortization on the intangible assets was $4.7 million as of December 31, 2017 and $3.4 million as of December 31, 2016.

Revenue Recognition
 Product Sales
 We recognize revenue from product sales when the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred, (iii) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured.  We evaluate customers that have not developed a sufficient payment history with us or for whom a letter of credit is not in place at the time of the transaction and defer revenues until collectability is reasonably assured.
 For all sales, we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement.  If the other revenue recognition criteria are met, revenue for these product sales is recognized upon delivery to the customer as all risks and rewards of ownership have been substantively transferred to the customer at that point.  For sales to customers who arrange for and manage the shipping process, we recognize revenue upon shipment from our facilities. Shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers are classified as revenue.  The customer’s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of delivery and are not dependent on the subsequent use or resale of our products. For sales where all revenue recognition criteria are not met, revenue is deferred and related inventory remains on our books.
 
Concentration of Significant Customers & Geographical Sales
 For the year ended December 31, 2017, our sales were concentrated with respect to five direct customers, which comprised 68% of our product revenue recognized. One licensee and one direct customer accounted for 77% of total outstanding accounts receivable (excluding receivables from BARDA) as of December 31, 2017.
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, our sales were concentrated with respect to two distributors and three direct customers, which comprised 65% of our product revenue recognized.  Two direct customers accounted for 57% of total outstanding accounts receivable (excluding receivables from BARDA) as of December 31, 2016.
 Product revenues, classified by geographic location, are as follows (in thousands):
 
 
 | Years ended December 31, | 
-----------------------+--------------------------+------
 | 2017 | | 2016 
 | Product Revenues | | % of Total | | Product Revenues | | % of Total
Americas | $ | 345 | | 13 | % | $ | 936 | 20 | %
Japan | | 1,924 | | 71 | % | | 3,279 | 71 | %
EMEA | | 344 | | 13 | % | | 379 | 8 | %
Asia Pacific | | 76 | | 3 | % | | 62 | 1 | %
Total product revenues | $ | 2,689 | | 100 | % | $ | 4,656 | 100 | %

Development Revenues
 We earn revenue for performing tasks under research and development agreements with governmental agencies like BARDA. Revenues derived from reimbursement of direct out-of-pocket expenses for research costs associated with government contracts are recorded as government contract and other within development revenues.  Government contract revenue is recorded at the gross amount of the reimbursement.  The costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in our statements of operations.   We recognized $3.7 million and $6.7 million in BARDA revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Research and Development
 Research and development expenditures, which are charged to operations in the period incurred, include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products, regulatory fees, the purchase of laboratory supplies, and pre-clinical and clinical studies as well as salaries and benefits for our research and development employees.
 Also included in research and development expenditures are costs incurred to support the government reimbursement contract, including $3.5 million and $6.3 million of qualified expenses that were incurred for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, related to our government contract with BARDA.
 74


Deferred Financing Costs and Other Debt-Related Costs
 Deferred financing costs are capitalized, recorded as an offset to debt balances and amortized to interest expense over the term of the associated debt instrument using the effective interest method.  If the maturity of the debt is accelerated because of default or early debt repayment, then the amortization would be accelerated.
Income Taxes
 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income (loss) in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Due to our history of losses, a full valuation allowance has been recognized against our deferred tax assets.
 The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has not recorded any interest or penalties related to income tax matters. The Company does not foresee any material changes to unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.
 Share-Based Compensation
 We recognize the fair value of all share-based payment awards in our statements of operations over the requisite vesting period of each award, which approximates the period during which the employee and non-employee director is required to provide service in exchange for the award. We estimate the fair value of these options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using assumptions for expected volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rate.  Expected volatility is based primarily on historical volatility and is computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods that correspond to the expected term of the options. The expected term is calculated based on historical data for and applied to all employee awards as a single group as we do not expect (nor does historical data suggest) substantially different exercise or post-vesting termination behavior amongst our employee population. The risk-free interest rate is the interest rate for treasury instruments with maturities that approximate the expected term.
 Segment Information
 For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company is managed as a single operating segment, therefore we report our results in one operating segment.
 Loss Per Share
 Basic per share data is computed by dividing net income or loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted per share data is computed by dividing net income or loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased to include, if dilutive, the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding as calculated using the treasury stock method. Potential common shares were related entirely to outstanding but unexercised options and warrants for all periods presented.
 We have excluded all potentially dilutive securities, including unvested performance-based restricted stock, from the calculation of diluted loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, as their inclusion would be antidilutive.  Potentially dilutive securities excluded from the calculations of diluted loss per share were 20.5 million as of December 31, 2017, which includes 19.5 million outstanding warrants and 1.0 million options and restricted stock awards. Potentially dilutive securities excluded from the calculations of diluted loss per share were 4.2 million as of December 31, 2016.
 Recently Issued and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The new standard is based on the principle that revenue should be recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of promised goods or services. ASU 2014-09 and all subsequent amendments (collectively, the “new standards”) may be applied using either the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case 
 75


the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. We will adopt the standards beginning the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We have completed our assessment of the new standard and are evaluating the impact of the new required disclosures. Overall, we do not expect the timing or amounts related to the revenue recognition under the new standards to be materially different from our current revenue recognition policy. Our product revenues are recognized at a point in time, which is when we control transfers to the customer.  We will make accounting policy elections to 1) treat shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer obtains control of the goods as fulfillment costs and 2) exclude sales (and similar) taxes from the measurement of the transaction price. Because we have no open contracts as of December 31, 2017, there will be no cumulative effect of applying the new standards.
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. Under this new guidance, at the commencement date, lessees will be required to recognize (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. This guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments, which addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We do not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18, Restricted Cash, which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of this standard will change the presentation of our statement of cash flows to include our restricted cash balance with the non-restricted cash balances. We do not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2016-18 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, to simplify how all entities assess goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. As amended, the goodwill impairment test will consist of one step comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
 In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to provide clarity and reduce both 1) diversity in practice and 2) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718 to a change in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award.  ASU 2017-09 provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting under Topic 718.  The amendments in ASU 2017-09 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period.  The amendments in ASU 2017-09 should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date.  We do not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2017-09 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
 In July 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This update applies to companies that measure inventory on a first in, first out, or FIFO, or average cost basis. Under this update, companies are to measure their inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 with earlier application permitted as of 
 76


the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption, effective January 1, 2017, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which involves several aspects of the accounting for stock-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This new guidance will require all income tax effects of awards to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, as opposed to additional paid-in-capital where it is currently recorded. It also will allow an employer to repurchase more of an employee’s shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. All tax-related cash flows resulting from stock-based payments are to be reported as operating activities on the statement of cash flows. The guidance also allows a Company to make a policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. This new standard is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We have elected to keep our policy consistent for the application of a forfeiture rate and, as such, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies and provides a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted for acquisition or deconsolidation transactions occurring before the issuance date or effective date and only when the transactions have not been reported in issued or made available for issuance financial statements. We elected to early adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2017 and this guidance was used in our assessment of the Azaya Therapeutics asset purchase agreement entered into in February 2017.
  
3. | Transactions with Olympus Corporation
---+--------------------------------------

 Under our Joint Venture Termination Agreement (“Termination Agreement”), dated May 8, 2013, with Olympus Corporation (“Olympus”), we were required to pay Olympus a total purchase price of $6.0 million within two years of the date of the Termination Agreement. Pursuant to amendments to the Termination Agreement, dated April 30, 2015 and January 8, 2016, the Company’s repayment obligations were extended through May 8, 2016.  We made payments under the Termination Agreement totaling approximately $4.2 million through December 31, 2015, as well as separate payments of $0.5 million each in January 2016 and April 2016, and paid the remaining balance of $0.8 million before the May 8, 2016 due date. There were no outstanding obligations to Olympus as of December 31, 2017.
  
4. | Fair Value
---+-----------

Measurements
 Fair value measurements are market-based measurements, not entity-specific measurements.  Therefore, fair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  We follow a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values.  The basis for fair value measurements for each level within the hierarchy is described below:

• | Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in active markets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value presented on our balance sheets.   Financial Instruments
 We disclose fair value information about all financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheets, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. The disclosures of estimated fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 2017 and 2016, were determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methods. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
 77


The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Further, based on the borrowing rates currently available for loans with similar terms, we believe the fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value.
 At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate fair value and the carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt were as follows (in thousands):
 
 
 | December 31, 2017 | | December 31, 2016 | 
-----+-------------------+--------+-------------------+--
 | Fair Value | | Carrying Value | | | Fair Value | | Carrying Value
Debt | $ | 13,427 | | $ | 13,624 | | $ | 17,611 | $ | 17,637

 
Carrying value is net of debt discount of $0.4 million and $1.2 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 The fair value of debt is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as some of the inputs, primarily the effective interest rate, to our valuation model are either not observable quoted prices or are not derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
 Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities
 We apply fair value techniques on a non-recurring basis associated with: (1) valuing potential impairment losses related to goodwill which are accounted for pursuant to the authoritative guidance for intangibles—goodwill and other; and (2) valuing potential impairment losses related to long-lived assets which are accounted for pursuant to the authoritative guidance for property, plant and equipment.

5. | Asset Purchase Agreement with Azaya Therapeutics
---+-------------------------------------------------

 On February 15, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), we completed the acquisition from Azaya Therapeutics, Inc. (“Azaya”) of certain tangible assets which consisted of a research lab, equipment and leasehold improvements and the assumption of certain of liabilities of Azaya, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”). The book value of the tangible assets acquired was approximately $3.0 million at the acquisition date. The assets acquired are located in a facility rented in San Antonio, TX, by Cytori. In addition, pursuant to the Agreement, we acquired intangible assets comprised of two drug candidates in process research and development (IPR&D) stage (i) ATI-0918, a generic bioequivalent formulation of Doxil®/Caelix®, a chemotherapy drug that is a liposomal formulation of doxorubicin; and (ii) ATI-1123, a chemotherapy drug that is a liposomal formulation of docetaxel.
 At the closing of the acquisition, we (i) issued 1,173,241 of shares of our common stock in Azaya’s name, (A) 879,931 of which were delivered to Azaya promptly after the Closing, and (B) 293,310 of which were deposited into a 15-month escrow pursuant to a standard escrow agreement; and (ii) assumed the obligation to pay approximately $1.8 million of Azaya’s existing payables, all of which were paid prior December 31, 2017.  At the Closing Date, Azaya had no employees and therefore no Azaya employees were transitioned to us.  
 In addition, as of the Closing Date, the Company committed to certain contingent consideration to: (i) pay Azaya fixed commercialization milestone payments based upon achievement of certain net sales milestones for ATI-0918; (ii) make certain earn-out payments to Azaya equal to a mid-single-digit percentage of net sales of ATI-0918; and (iii) make certain earn-out payments to Azaya equal to a low single-digit percentage of net sales of any product (ATI-0918 is the “Generic Product” and ATI-1123 is the “Patented Product”), including ATI-1123, that practices a claim in the related patent assigned by Azaya to the Company (the “ATI-1123 Patent”).  Our aggregate earn-out payment obligations to Azaya from global net sales of both ATI-0918 and any Patented Product will not exceed $100.0 million (the “Earn-Out Cap”).
 Further, the Agreement provides that if we enter into certain assignments, licenses or other transfers of rights to a Patented Product or the ATI-1123 Patent, we will pay Azaya a percentage in the low to mid-teens of the consideration received by us, provided, that our aggregate payment obligation to Azaya for any such assignment, license or other transfer of rights will not exceed $50.0 million.
 If the Company or its successors, sublicenses or transferees sells a competing product to ATI-0918 at any time prior to satisfaction of the Earn-Out Cap, other than because ATI-0918 fails to receive marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency within a certain period of time or fails to generate a minimum threshold of net sales within a pre-determined amount of time, then 50% of the net sales of such competing product would be deemed to be net sales of ATI-0918 under the Agreement for purposes of calculating commercialization milestone payments and earn-out payments.
 78


We accounted for the acquisition as an asset acquisition because the acquired set of assets did not meet the definition of a business. The total consideration of $4.3 million, which consists of $2.3 million related to the fair value of the common stock issued to Azaya at the acquisition date, $1.8 million in assumed liabilities and $0.2 million in acquisition costs, was allocated to the assets acquired based on their relative fair values at the time of acquisition. All other future payments were deemed contingent consideration which will be accounted for when the contingency is resolved and the consideration is paid or becomes payable.
 When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, the Company estimated the cost to replace the tangible asset with a new asset, taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, the Company used a discounted cash flow model with key inputs being the applicable discount rate, market growth rates and the timing and amount of future cash flows. The acquired IPR&D is in the early stage of development. Additional research, pre-clinical studies, and regulatory approvals must be successfully completed prior to selling any product. Because there is no current alternative use for the IPR&D, following the authoritative accounting guidance, the Company has expensed it in full on the Closing Date. The Company measured the fair value of the shares issued as consideration in the acquisition of the assets based on the stock price at the acquisition date. Transaction costs directly related to the acquisition of the assets have been capitalized. The total consideration was allocated on a relative fair value basis to the assets acquired, as follows (in thousands):

Tangible assets | $ | 2,586
Intangible assets | | 1,686

---+------------------------------

 We have entered into agreements with various research organizations for pre-clinical and clinical development studies, which have provisions for cancellation. Under the terms of these agreements, the vendors provide a variety of services including conducting research, recruiting and enrolling patients, monitoring studies and data analysis. Payments under these agreements typically include fees for services and reimbursement of expenses. The timing of payments due under these agreements is estimated based on current study progress.  As of December 31, 2017, we have clinical research study obligations of $0.6 million, all of which are expected to be complete within a year.  Should the timing of the clinical trials change, the timing of the payment of these obligations would also change.
 We lease facilities for our headquarters office location as well as international office locations. As of December 31, 2017, we have contractual lease obligations to make payments on leases of office and manufacturing space as follows:

 On February 27, 2017, we entered into a Lease Agreement of office space for our corporate headquarters in San Diego, California (the “Lease”). The initial term of the Lease is 63 months and may be extended upon mutual agreement. The commencement date was originally expected to take place in November 2017 and subsequently amended to January 1, 2018. In connection with our restructuring announced in September 2017, we began negotiations with the landlord and in February 2018, announced a buy-out of our obligations with the Lease of approximately $0.6 million.
 On January 27, 2017, we entered into a Lease Agreement of office space for our office in Tokyo, Japan (the “Japan Lease”). The initial term of the Japan Lease is 61 months, and may be extended upon mutual agreement.  The Lease commenced on April 15, 2017.
 We are party to an agreement with Roche Diagnostics Corporation, our sole supplier of reagents, which requires us to make certain product purchase minimums until 2020. Pursuant to the agreement, as of December 31, 2017, we have a minimum purchase obligation as follows:
 
 
Years Ending December 31, | | Obligation

2019 | | 1,473 
2020 | | 1,473 
Total | $ | 4,020 

 
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings.  Due to their nature, such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions.  Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and/or discloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate.  Management believes that any liability to us that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations as a whole.
  
8. | Long-term Obligations
---+----------------------

 On May 29, 2015, we entered into the Loan and Security Agreement, (the “Loan and Security Agreement”), with Oxford, pursuant to which Oxford funded an aggregate principal amount of $17.7 million (“Term Loan”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement. The Term Loan accrues interest at a floating rate of at least 8.95% per annum, comprised of three-month LIBOR rate with a floor of 1.00% plus 7.95%.  Pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, we were previously required to make interest only payments through June 1, 2016 and thereafter we were required to make payments of principal and accrued interest in equal monthly installments sufficient to amortize the Term Loan through June 1, 2019, the maturity date. On February 23, 2016, we received an acknowledgement and agreement from Oxford related to the positive data on our U.S. ACT-OA clinical trial. As a result, pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, the period for which we are required to make interest-only payments was extended from July 1, 2016 to January 1, 2017. All unpaid principal and interest with respect to the Term Loan is due and payable in full on June 1, 2019. At maturity of the Term Loan, or earlier repayment in full following voluntary prepayment or upon acceleration, we are required to make a final payment in an aggregate amount equal to approximately $1.1 million. In connection with the Term Loan, on May 29, 2015, we issued to Oxford warrants to purchase an aggregate of 94,441 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $10.35 per share. These warrants became exercisable as of November 30, 2015 and will expire on May 29, 2025 and, following the authoritative accounting guidance, are equity classified and its respective fair value was recorded as a discount to the debt.
 On September 20, 2017, we entered into an amendment to the Term Loan, pursuant to which, among other things, Oxford and the Lenders agreed to reduce the minimum liquidity covenant level originally at $5 million to $1.5 million. The amendment also extended the interest-only period under the Loan Agreement through August 1, 2018, as the Company successfully closed on a financing and received unrestricted net cash proceeds in excess of $5 million before December 29, 2017.
 81


The Term Loan, as amended, is collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the Company’s existing and subsequently acquired assets, including its intellectual property assets, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement, as amended. The intellectual property asset collateral will be released upon the Company achieving certain liquidity level when the total principal outstanding under the Loan Agreement is less than $3 million. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the debt covenants under the Loan and Security Agreement.
 The Term Loan Agreement contains customary indemnification obligations and customary events of default, including, among other things, our failure to fulfill certain obligations under the Term Loan, as amended, and the occurrence of a material adverse change, which is defined as a material adverse change in our business, operations, or condition (financial or otherwise), a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of any portion of the loan. In the event of default by us or a declaration of material adverse change by our lender, under the Term Loan, the lender would be entitled to exercise its remedies thereunder, including the right to accelerate the debt, upon which we may be required to repay all amounts then outstanding under the Term Loan, which could materially harm our financial condition. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Term Loan and have not received any notification or indication from the Lenders to invoke the material adverse change clause. However, due to our current cash flow position and the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, the entire principal amount of the Term Loan has been reclassified to short-term. We will continue to evaluate the debt classification on a quarterly basis and evaluate for reclassification in the future should our financial condition improve.
 Additional details relating to the outstanding Term Loan as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 are presented in the following table (in thousands):

Interest expense is calculated using the effective interest method, therefore it is inclusive of non-cash amortization in the amount of $0.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount, capitalized loan costs, and accretion of final payment.
  
9. | Income Taxes
---+-------------

 Due to our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and since we have recorded a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, there was no provision or benefit for income taxes recorded.

We have established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. At such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that deferred assets are realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced. We have recorded a full valuation allowance of $97.1 million as of December 31, 2017 as we do not believe it is more likely than not our net deferred tax assets will be realized. We decreased our valuation allowance by approximately $37.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.
 At December 31, 2017, we had federal, and state tax loss carry forwards of approximately $365.9 million, and $147.4 million.  The federal and state net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in 2019 and 2028, respectively, if unused.  At December 31, 2017, we had federal and state tax credit carry forwards of approximately $5.1 million and $4.5 million, respectively, after reduction for uncertain tax positions.  The Company has not performed a formal research and development 
 83


credit study with respect to these credits.  The federal credits will begin to expire in 2018, if unused, and the state credits carry forward indefinitely. 
 Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) of 1986, as amended, specifically IRC §382 and IRC §383, our ability to use net operating loss and R&D tax credit carry forwards (“tax attribute carry forwards”) to offset future taxable income is limited if we experience a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% within a three-year testing period. We have not completed an ownership change analysis pursuant to IRC Section 382 for taxable years ended after December 31, 2007. If ownership changes within the meaning of IRC Section 382 are identified as having occurred subsequent to 2007, the amount of remaining tax attribute carry forwards available to offset future taxable income and income tax expense in future years may be significantly restricted or eliminated.  Further, our deferred tax assets associated with such tax attributes could be significantly reduced upon realization of an ownership change within the meaning of IRC §382.
 In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Act) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the Company, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The 2017 Act also provides for a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings and the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed in service after September 27, 2017, as well as, prospective changes beginning in 2018, including additional limitations on executive compensation, limitations on the deductibility of interest and capitalization of research and development expenditures. While the 2017 Act provides for a territorial tax system, beginning in 2018, it includes two new U.S. tax base erosion provision, the global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") provisions and the base-erosion and anti-abuse tax ("BEAT") provisions.
 Reduction of the U.S. Corporate Income Tax Rate: The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. Accordingly, the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were premeasured to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, resulting in a $45.8 million increase in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 and a corresponding $(45.8) million decrease in net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017. The impact was fully offset by a valuation allowance.
 The Act will no longer allow deductions for compensation in excess of $1 million for certain employees, even if paid as commissions or performance based compensation. It also subjects the principal executive officer, principal financial officer and three other highest paid officers to the limitation and once the individual becomes a covered person, the individual will remain a covered person for all future years. The tax effects of these provisions require further analysis which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018.
 The 2017 Act provided for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits ("E&P") through the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company's foreign subsidiary had an estimated accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2017. The Company does not expect it will be subject to this tax and therefore has not included any tax impacts related to the mandatory deemed repatriation in its consolidated financial statements.
 The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its US income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary's tangible assets. While the Company may elect to account for GILTI tax in the period in which it is incurred, or recognize deferred taxes when basis differences exist that are expected to affect the amount of the GILTI inclusion upon reversal, the Company has not yet completed a detailed analysis of the GILTI and has not made a policy election as of December 31, 2017.
 The BEAT provisions in the 2017 Act eliminates the deduction of certain base-erosion payments made to foreign corporations, and impose a minimum tax if greater than regular tax. The Company does not expect it will be subject to this tax and does not anticipate any tax impacts of BEAT with the filing of its consolidated financial statements for 2017.
 On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Act. The Company has recognized provisional tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts due to among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the 2017 Act. The accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018.
 The Company follows the provisions of income tax guidance which provides recognition criteria and a related measurement model for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The guidance requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are then measured using a probability weighted approach recognizing the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% 
 84


likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company has not recognized any liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.  
Following is a tabular reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits activity during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):
 
 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 
------------------------------------------------+------+-------+------+--
Unrecognized Tax Benefits – Beginning | $ | 2,062 | | $ | 1,987 | 
Gross increases – tax positions in prior period | | — | | | 1 | 
Gross decreases – tax positions in prior period | | — | | | (13 | )
Gross increase – current-period tax positions | | 95 | | | 87 | 
Unrecognized Tax Benefits – Ending | $ | 2,157 | | $ | 2,062 | 

 
The unrecognized tax benefit amounts are reflected in the determination of the Company’s deferred tax assets.  If recognized, none of these amounts would affect the Company’s effective tax rate, since it would be offset by an equal reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.  The Company does not foresee material changes to its liability for uncertain tax benefits within the next twelve months. 
 
The Company did not recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses as of December 31, 2017.
 The Company’s material tax jurisdictions are United States and California. To its knowledge, the Company is currently not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
 The Company’s tax years for 1998 (federal) and 1997 (CA) and forward can be subject to examination by the United States and California tax authorities due to the carry forward of net operating losses and research development credits.
  
10. | Employee Benefit Plan
----+----------------------

 We implemented a 401(k) retirement savings and profit sharing plan (the “Plan”) effective January 1, 1999. We may make discretionary annual contributions to the Plan, which is allocated to the profit sharing accounts based on the number of years of employee service and compensation. At the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, we may also match the participants’ contributions to the Plan. We made no discretionary or matching contributions to the Plan in 2017 or 2016.
  
11. | Stockholders’ Equity
----+---------------------

Preferred Stock
 The Company has authorized 5 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to designate the terms and conditions of any preferred stock we issue without further action by the common stockholders.  There were 13,500 shares of Series A 3.6% Convertible Preferred Stock that had been issued at December 31, 2017 and 2016, none of which were outstanding as of either date. All outstanding shares of the Series A 3.6% Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock by the first quarter of 2015 at the option of the holders.
 On November 27, 2017, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock with the Delaware Secretary of State creating a new series of its authorized preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, designated as the “Series B Convertible Preferred Stock”. The number of shares initially constituting the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock was set at 10,000 shares. Pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, originally filed on August 14, 2017, as amended, and declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on November 2, 2017, and related prospectus (as supplemented), the Company registered and distributed to holders of its common stock, at no charge, non-transferable subscription rights to purchase up to an aggregate of 10,000 units consisting of 10,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and 18 million warrants, with each warrant exercisable for one common stock at an exercise price of $0.3333 per share for 30 months from the date of issuance at any time after the date the stockholder approval to increase our authorized common stock share count.  Pursuant to the 2017 Rights Offering, which closed on November 28, 2017, the Company sold an aggregate of 10,000 units, resulting in total net proceeds to the Company of approximately $8.8 million.  The Company applied to list the warrants on Nasdaq under the symbol “CYTXS” to meet the minimum listing criteria to be accepted for listing on Nasdaq subsequent to attainment of stockholder approval.  Based on the relevant authoritative accounting guidance, the warrants were equity classified at the issuance date. The warrants may be redeemed by the Company at $0.01 per warrant prior to their expiration if the Company’s common stock closes above $0.833 per share for 10 consecutive trading days.
 The fair value of the common stock into which the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible on the date of issuance exceeded the proceeds allocated to the preferred stock, resulting in the beneficial conversion feature that we recognized as a 
 85


dividend to the preferred stockholders and, accordingly, an adjustment to net loss to arrive at net loss allocable to common stockholders.  We recorded a deemed dividend within additional paid-in capital of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, related to a beneficial conversion feature included in the issuance of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.  Approximately 75% of the of the outstanding shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock by December 31, 2017 at the option of the holders.
 Common Stock
 Pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, originally filed on April 6, 2016, as amended, and declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 26, 2016, and related prospectus (as supplemented), the Company registered and distributed to its participating stockholders of record as of the announced May 20, 2016 record date, one non-transferable subscription right for each share of common stock held by each stockholder as of the record date (“2016 Rights Offering”). Each right entitled the holder thereof to purchase one unit at the subscription price of $2.55 per unit, composed of one share of common stock and 0.5 of a warrant, with each whole warrant exercisable to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $3.06 per share for 30 months from the date of issuance.  Pursuant to the 2016 Rights Offering, which closed on June 15, 2016, the Company sold an aggregate of 6,704,852 units, resulting in total net proceeds to the Company of $15.3 million.  The warrants issued pursuant to the 2016 Rights Offering are currently listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “CYTXW.”  Based on the relevant authoritative accounting guidance, the warrants were equity classified at the issuance date. The warrants may be redeemed by the Company at $0.01 per warrant prior to their expiration if the Company’s common stock closes above $7.65 per share for 10 consecutive trading days.
 On December 22, 2016, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park”) pursuant to which the Company has the right to sell to Lincoln Park and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $20.0 million in amounts of shares, of the Company’s common stock, over the 30-month period following March 30, 207. The Company may direct Lincoln Park, at the Company’s sole discretion and subject to certain conditions, to purchase up to 100,000 shares of common stock on any business day but in no event will the amount of a single Regular Purchase (as defined in the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement) exceed $1.0 million. The purchase price of shares of common stock related to the Regular Purchases will be based on the prevailing market prices of such shares at the time of sales. The Company’s sales of shares of common stock to Lincoln Park under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement are limited to no more than the number of shares that would result in the beneficial ownership by Lincoln Park and its affiliates, at any single point in time, of more than 9.99% of the then outstanding shares of the common stock. There are no trading volume requirements or restrictions under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement. There is no upper limit on the price per share that Lincoln Park must pay for common stock under a Regular Purchase or an accelerated purchase and in no event will shares be sold to Lincoln Park on a day our closing price is less than the floor price of $0.50 per share as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. On December 22, 2016, the Company issued to Lincoln Park 127,419 shares of common stock with a market value on the date of issuance of approximately $0.2 million as commitment shares in consideration for entering into the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement. The Company will issue up to an additional 382,258 shares of common stock on a pro rata basis to Lincoln Park only as and when shares are sold under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement to Lincoln Park. Through December 31, 2017, the Company has sold a total of 1.9 million shares under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, for proceeds of approximately $1.7 million. 
  
12. | Stock-based Compensation
----+-------------------------

 In August 2014, we adopted the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”), which provides our employees, directors and consultants the opportunity to purchase our common stock in the form of options (incentive or non-qualified), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted stock bonuses, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards other stock-based awards, and deferred compensation awards.  The 2014 Plan initially provides for issuance of 265,000 shares of our common stock.  In August 2015, the Company amended the 2014 Plan to add 301,800 shares to its share pool. In addition, the amendment increased the number of “incentive stock options” which may be issued under the 2014 Plan by an identical amount. In May 2016, the Company amended the 2014 Plan to add 333,333 shares to its share pool. In May 2017, the Company amended the 2014 Plan to add 2,000,000 shares to its share pool.
 On December 29, 2015, we adopted the 2015 New Employee Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”). Awards under the 2015 Plan may only be made to an employee who has not previously been an employee or member of the Board of any parent or subsidiary, or following a bona fide period of non-employment by the Company or a parent or subsidiary, if he or she is granted such award in connection with his or her commencement of employment with the Company or a subsidiary and such grant is an inducement material to his or her entering into employment with the Company or such subsidiary. The 2015 Plan provides for issuance of 66,666 shares. In January 2017, the Company amended the 2015 Plan to add 250,000 shares to its share pool.
 As of December 31, 2017, there are 304,166 shares and 2,060,504 shares of common stock remaining and available for future issuances under the 2015 and 2014 Plans, respectively, which are exclusive of securities to be issued upon an exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights.

Stock Options
 Generally, options issued under the 2014 Plan, are subject to four-year vesting, and have a contractual term of 10 years.  Most options contain one of the following two vesting provisions:

• | 12/48 of a granted award will vest after one year of service, while an additional 1/48 of the award will vest at the end of each month thereafter for 36 months, or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 1/48 of the award will vest at the end of each month over a four-year period.

There were no stock options exercised in 2017 or 2016. 
 The fair value of each option awarded during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model based on the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
 
 | Years ended December 31, | 
-------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+------
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | 
Expected term | 6.6 years | | | 6.0 years | 
Risk-free interest rate | | 2.20 | % | | | 1.75 | %
Volatility | | 78.84 | % | | | 77.56 | %
Dividends | | — | | | | — | 
Resulting weighted average grant date fair value | $ | 1.05 | | | $ | 1.84 | 

 
The weighted average risk-free interest rate represents the interest rate for treasury constant maturity instruments published by the Federal Reserve Board. If the term of available treasury constant maturity instruments is not equal to the expected term of an employee option, we use the weighted average of the two Federal Reserve securities closest to the expected term of the employee option.
 The dividend yield has been assumed to be zero as we (a) have never declared or paid any dividends and (b) do not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends on our outstanding shares of common stock in the foreseeable future.
 Restricted Stock Awards
 Generally, restricted stock awards issued under the 2014 Plan are subject to a vesting period that coincides with the fulfillment of service requirements for each award and have a contractual term of 10 years. These awards are amortized to compensation expense over the estimated vesting period based upon the fair value of our common stock on the award date.

The following summarizes the total compensation cost recognized for the stock options and restricted stock awards in the accompanying financial statements (in thousands):
 
 
 | Years ended December 31, | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+----
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Total compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements recognized in the statement of operations | $ | 753 | | $ | 1,080

 
As of December 31, 2017, the total compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and stock awards not yet recognized for all our plans is approximately $0.6 million, which is expected to be recognized as a result of vesting under service conditions over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.
 To settle stock options and restricted stock awards, we will issue new shares of our common stock.  At December 31, 2017, we have an aggregate of 6,208,390 shares authorized and available to satisfy option exercises under our plans.
