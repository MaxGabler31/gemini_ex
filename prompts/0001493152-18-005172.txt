Item 1. Description of Business.
Organization
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 27, 2014, with fiscal year end in December 31, under the original name Tech Foundry Ventures, Inc. On March 3, 2016, our Board and majority shareholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation by adding Articles Twelve through Fourteen, which, in summary: (i) grants the board the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision in the Articles; (ii) authorizes the Board, without the consent of the shareholders, to adopt any recapitalization affecting the outstanding securities by effecting a forward or reverse splits of all of the outstanding securities, provided the recapitalization does not require any amendment to the Articles; and (iii) authorizes the Board to change our name without shareholder approval. On July 6, 2016, we changed our name to Nevada Canyon Gold Corp. On April 28, 2016, we split our common stock on a 10:1 basis without affecting the par value. All shares and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to account for the split.
 
We have never been party to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding, nor have we undergone any material reclassification, merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
 
We were a consulting service company, which provided management and consulting services to early and middle stage start-ups. We were engaged by our first client in June 2015. In December 2015, we changed our business to mineral exploration, when we acquired all of Nevada Canyon Gold Corporation’s - a privately held Nevada corporation (“NCG”) - rights, titles and interests in and to an exploration agreement, dated for reference September 15, 2015, with an option to form a joint venture (the “Agreement”) with Walker River Resources Corp., a Canadian public company (TSX.V:WRR) on its wholly-owned Lapon Canyon Gold Project (“Lapon Canyon Project”, or “the Property”).
 
Our principal business, executive and registered statutory office is located at 316 California Avenue, Suite 543, Reno, NV 89509 and our telephone number is (888) 909-5548, fax is (888) 909-1033 and email contact is info@nevadacanyongold.com. Our website address is www.nevadacanyongold.com.
 
Business
 
We were a party to an Exploration Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Option to form a Joint Venture with Walker River Resources Corp. (“WRR”) on its wholly-owned Lapon Canyon Gold Project (“Lapon Canyon Project”, or “the Property”) located approximately 40 miles southeast of Yerington, Nevada. The Agreement did not grant us an interest in or to the Property, or any equity interest in WRR, but rather, granted us the right to earn up to an undivided 50% interest in the Property by incurring eligible expenditures of $500,000 (over a two-year period) in exploration and other expenses required to carry out a work program established and operated by WRR on the Property (the “Eligible Expenses”).
 
To acquire full consideration for all rights in and to the Agreement we paid NCG $65,000, which consisted of an initial cash deposit payment of $25,000, and a second cash payment of $30,000; the balance of $10,000 was paid through the issuance of 100,000 of our restricted common shares at a price of $0.10 per common share.
 
The Agreement did not grant us an interest in or to the Property, or any equity interest in WRR, but rather, granted us the right to earn up to an undivided 50% interest in the Property by incurring eligible expenditures of $500,000 (over a two-year period) in exploration and other expenses required to carry out a work program established and operated by WRR on the Property (the “Eligible Expenses”). Thereafter, the Agreement granted us an option to enter into a joint venture with WRR for further exploration and development of the Property.

On July 5, 2017, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with WRR on the Property. As at the date of the Purchase Agreement our interest in the Property was 30%. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement WRR agreed to buy back our 30% interest in the Lapon Canyon Project in exchange for 9,100,000 common shares of WRR and warrants to acquire an additional 11,900,000 common shares. Each WRR Warrant is exercisable for a period of five years without further consideration into one common share in the capital of WRR. The terms of the WRR Warrants contain a provision which prevents us from exercising any of the WRR Warrants which would result in us owning 10% or more of the issued and outstanding shares of WRR. The above securities were issued on July 18, 2017, upon acceptance of the Purchase Agreement by the TSX Venture Exchange, and were subject to a hold period which expired on November 20, 2017.
 
On June 7, 2017, we entered into an exploration lease and option to purchase agreement (the “Garfield Agreement”) with Goodsprings Development LLC (“Goodsprings”), a Nevada limited liability corporation on the Garfield Flats Project (the “Garfield Property”), consisting of six Orsa Claims and six Lazy Claims totaling 240 acres located in sections 27 and 28 of T 7 N, R 32 E, Mineral County, Nevada about 18 miles southeast of the town of Hawthorne. The term of the Garfield Agreement is ten years and is subject to extension for two additional terms of ten years each.
 
To retain the rights to the exploration lease, we are required to make the following minimum annual payments:
 

 | Minimum Payment | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+-------
Upon execution of the option agreement (the “Effective Date”)(paid) | $ | 15,000
First anniversary of the Effective Date | $ | 15,000
Second and third anniversaries of the Effective Date | $ | 20,000
Fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Effective Date | $ | 25,000
Sixth and each succeeding anniversary of the Effective Date in perpetuity | $ | 40,000

 
In addition to the minimum annual payments, we agreed to pay Goodsprings a 2% production royalty based on the gross returns from the production and sale of minerals from the Garfield Property.
 
At any time during the term of the Agreement we have a right to acquire 100% ownership of the Garfield Property for a one-time payment of $300,000 (the “Purchase Price”). The minimum annual payments paid by us to Goodsprings, cannot be applied or credited against the Purchase Price; however, once we exercise our option to acquire the Garfield Property, the minimum annual payments shall be credited against the production royalties payable.
 
On August 2, 2017, we entered into an exploration lease agreement (the “Lazy Claims Agreement”) with Tarsis Resources US Inc. (“Tarsis”), a Nevada corporation, to lease rights to three additional Lazy claims totaling 60 acres and located in the vicinity of our new Garfield Property. The term of the Lazy Claims Agreement is ten years, and is subject to extension for an additional two consecutive 10-year terms. Full consideration of the Lazy Claims Agreement consists of the following: an initial cash payment of $1,000 to Tarsis, which we paid upon the execution of the Lazy Claims Agreement, with $2,000 payable to Tarsis on each subsequent anniversary of the effective date. We agreed to pay Tarsis a 2% production royalty (the “Lazy Claims Royalty”) based on the gross returns from the production and sale of minerals from the Lazy Claims Property. Should the Lazy Claims Royalty payments to Tarsis be in excess of $2,000 per year, we will not be required to pay a $2,000 annual minimum payment.
 
During the third quarter of our Fiscal 2017, we staked an additional 69 Orsa Claims and 75 Lazy Claims, with a total paid cost of $54,152. These claims were added to the Garfield Flats Project.
 
Unproved Mineral Properties
 
Our mineral interests are comprised of the following:

Geology and Mineralization
 
Geology 
 
The US Geological Survey has mapped the area and has published the results as Miscellaneous Field Studies maps, MF 1485 and MF 1486. Mapped units include Paleozoic metasediments, Mesozoic sediments and intrusions, and Cenozoic volcanic rocks and porphyry intrusions. Like most of the Walker Lane, the area has a strong system of N50W- trending, normal and strike-slip faults along with a series of generally NE-trending thrust faults. The area has seen prospecting since the late 1800’s and contains hundreds of prospect pits and adits that explore various styles of base and precious metal mineralization.
 
The published USGS geologic quadrangle map for the Pamlico mine area, (MF 1485, MF 1486, Oldow, 1985), shows the eastern portion of the Garfield Flats project area underlain by a thick, undivided sequence of folded and faulted Mesozoic and or Paleozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The western portion of the project is underlain by Jurassic- to Triassic-age Sunrise and Gabbs Formations comprising interbedded limestones and calcareous mudstones. Locally, black Tertiary basalt caps the older rocks. The structural fabric is dominated by NW-trending, Walker Lane structures and by an older N70o E fabric, several phases of strongly altered and locally mineralized intrusive rocks as well a as zones of jasperoids and strong silicification has been identified.
 
Mineralization
 
Previous work on the project has identified the following discrete zones of mineralization: (1) the Lazy Man gold zone which is a structurally-controlled, intrusion-related gold deposit that produced about 1,200 oz Au from NW-trending, high grade zones partially hosted by altered rhyolite dikes, (2) areas of strong vuggy silica alteration in both intrusive porphyritic rocks and volcanic agglomerates particularly in the footwall of the Lazy Man zone, (3) a large area of barite and copper mineralization with intense bleaching east of the gold zone, (4) strong copper showings to the southeast of the gold zone, (5) the Loman antimony mine to the southwest of the gold zone, (6) skarn zones to the west of the gold zone, (7) a large zone of strong IP response to the west of the gold zone, and (8) a pyrrhotite porphyry intrusion west of the gold zone.
Exploration History
 
The Garfield Flats Project covers several past producing small scale high grade mines, altered and mineralized zones discovered by geological compilations and mapping of the historical workings, discovered by previous exploration on the Project. Previous sampling on the project has revealed the presence of copper, bismuth, and antimony as well as pervasive lower grade gold mineralization, cut by vein structures (some previously mined) of higher grade gold. Previous induced polarization surveys also denoted the presence of significant coincident I.P. anomalies. Below is a summary of previous exploration of identified mineralized areas within the properties.
Lazy Man Mine 
 
The main structure that the mine workings explore has an N35oW trend and dips about 60o to the southwest. The vein was discovered in 1933 by a local prospector. The mine is credited with a historic production of about 1,200 ounces of gold from 2,800 feet (853 m) of underground workings. The three main shafts explore about 1,000 feet (304 m) of strike length on the vein, and the shafts extend to a maximum depth of 300 feet (91 m). The workings have been mapped and sampled in some detail by Congdon and Carey in 1974, and many multi-ounce gold values are noted in the remaining vein material. One 4.9 foot-long (1.5 m) sample from a cross cut on the 300 level contained 2.2 oz Au/ton (68.4g/t). The high grade veins occur within a broader zone of intense quartz-sericite alteration, which has previously been mapped as a rhyolite. Most of the mine dumps are composed of this “rhyolite”, and Congdon and Carey measured approximately 8,000 tons of this material containing from 0.09 to 0.21 oz Au/ton (3.07 to 7.1 g/t Au). Gold occurs in iron oxide-filled fractures along with druzy quartz veinlets, and there is occasional visible gold. Detailed mapping around the old workings of the Lazy Man mine has delineated a zone of intense acid-leaching in intrusive porphyritic rocks and volcanic agglomerates primarily in the footwall of the vein. The rock now has a porous and vuggy appearance; this style of alteration is interpreted to be “Vuggy Silica” alteration that is typical of the upper levels of high-sulfidation ore deposits. Surrounding the vuggy silica zone is a zone of strong argillic alteration. Recent work has discovered previously unrecognized mineralized zones east of and parallel to the Lazy Man vein that contain silicified, brecciated outcrops assaying 2.26 g/t Au and 8,150 ppm As. These zones have been traced for over 1,200 feet (365 m) and are up to 60 feet (18 m) wide.

Eastern barite – copper zone – A large zone of intense bleaching containing barite and copper oxide showings has been exposed by numerous trenches and prospect pits. The host rock appears to be the older meta-volcanic and meta-sediment package.
 
Southeast copper showings – There are several strong, northwest- and northeast-trending copper-quartz veins cutting the older meta volcanic-sediment package of rocks. Adits and prospect pits explore zones of visible copper oxide. A small copper oxide leaching tank near the largest adit is full of high-grade copper oxide.
 
Loman antimony mine - The Loman mine is an old antimony mine developed along a five foot-wide, quartz vein-fault breccia zone containing visible stibnite and antimony oxide minerals.
 
Western skarn zones - Earlier exploration work has trenched along a skarn zone and exposed heavy gossan zones with locally abundant copper oxide. A small inclined shaft explores the down-dip extension of the zone. The zone trends about N 70o E, contains numerous anomalous samples, and extends into the zone of strong IP response.
 
IP anomaly zone - In this area, there are a number of silicified, iron-oxide stained, jasperoid zones associated with structures in platey limestones. These silicified zones are on the periphery of the IP chargeability responses and are interpreted to be the result of hydrothermal fluids from an intrusive source. Another alteration feature in this zone is black calcite veins in the platey limestone. These veins often form a stockwork pattern and locally contain sulfide minerals. The veins are interpreted to be the result of hydrothermal fluids replacing carbonate material with silica to form jasperoids at depth and then transporting the carbonate into the fractured, overlying rocks. Within the area of black calcite veinlets, there are wide zones of bleached, mildly iron oxide-stained platey limestones with thin quartz veinlets and disseminated pyrite casts.
 
Exploration program
 
Phase I of the Garfield Flats exploration program will consist of reconnaissance prospecting, geological mapping, surface trenching, relocating historical workings and ground based geophysical surveys. This reconnaissance program will provide accurate modern data to assist in the planning of the phase II drill program. Phase I is set to begin in spring of 2018 and last for three to four weeks, with phase II expected to begin following the compilation of the phase I results, later in 2018.
 
Lapon Canyon Property
 
On December 17, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement (the “Agreement”) with Nevada Canyon Gold Corporation, to acquire all of NCG’s rights, titles and interests in and into an exploration agreement with an option to form a joint venture with Walker River Resources Corp. dated September 15, 2015. WRR owns a 100% undivided interest in and to the Lapon Canyon Gold Property, containing the Lapon Canyon claims (“the Property”), which is the subject of the Agreement.
 
The Agreement did not grant us an interest in or to the Property, or any equity interest in WRR, but rather, granted us the right to earn up to an undivided 50% interest in the Property by incurring $500,000 (over a two-year period) in eligible exploration and other expenses required to carry out an Exploration Program established and operated by WRR on the Property (the “Eligible Expenses”). On October 15, 2016, we incurred required $250,000 in Eligible Expenses, and earned the 25% interest to the Property.
 
On July 5, 2017, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with WRR on the Property. As at the date of the Purchase Agreement our interest in the Property was 30%. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement WRR agreed to buy back our 30% interest in the Lapon Canyon Project in exchange for 9,100,000 common shares of WRR and warrants to acquire an additional 11,900,000 common shares. Each WRR Warrant is exercisable for a period of five years without further consideration into one common share in the capital of WRR. The terms of the WRR Warrants contain a provision which prevents us from exercising any of the WRR Warrants which would result in us owning 10% or more of the issued and outstanding shares of WRR. The above securities were issued on July 18, 2017, upon acceptance of the Purchase Agreement by the TSX Venture Exchange, and were subject to a hold period which expired on November 20, 2017.

Location and means of access
 
The Lapon Canyon Gold Project (the “Lapon Project”, or the “Property”) consists of 36 claims (720 acres) situated in the Wassuk Range, easily accessible by secondary state roads from the main highway (40 miles) south of Yerington, Nevada. A state grid power transmission line passes within 2 miles of the Property.
 
Geology and Mineralization
 
The Lapon Project is located within the Walker Lane shear zone, a 60 mile wide structural corridor extending in a southeast direction from Reno, Nevada. Within this trend, numerous gold, silver, and copper mines are located, notably the historic Comstock Lode mines in Virginia City, the past producing Esmeralda/Aurora gold mine, with reported production of some one million ounces, as well as the Anaconda open pit copper mine in Yerington. Nevada Copper’s new mine, Pumpkin Hollow, is also located within the Wassuk Range about 15 miles north of Lapon.
 
The Lapon project is cut by a series of steeply dipping cross fault structures cutting across the Walker trend, analogous to other cross fault structures responsible for many gold and base metal deposits in the world. These faults are heavily sheared and altered (sericite, iron oxides) with abundant silica. They vary in width from 200 to 1000 feet. Four of these structures have been discovered at Lapon, and at least two can be traced for over three miles. Gold mineralization is located within echelon structures within these faults. At least one of these shear zones, the Lapon Rose zone was the site of underground development, and shows a minimum strike length of 3 miles, has a width of over 200 feet and has a vertical extent of at least 2000 feet.
 
Exploration history
 
Small scale high grade mining began on the project in 1914. Approximately 2000 feet of drifts and raises were developed from two adits and a two-stamp mill was built. Further limited underground work was carried out, returning numerous assay values in the range of one ounce per ton, with a sample at the end of an adit returning 20.6 ounces per ton. (National Instrument 43-101, Montgomery and Barr, 2004)
 
2015 Exploration program
 
Walker River Resources Corp. began its initial exploration work in April 2015 with significant exploration progress made during 2015. Within the upper Lapon Rose Zone, gold mineralization in the form of Visible Gold was noted in two different locations within the upper adit. Due to intense alteration and shearing the on-site identification was found to be rather difficult; the samples were cut and studied using a microscope. The assays confirmed that the in situ rock is Porphyry, in all probabilities, a quart monzonite intrusive. Copper mineralization, in the form of malachite and chalcopyrite, has also been identified within the Lapon Rose Zone.
 
During the same exploration program a newly discovered shear/altered zone was discovered some 2000 feet east of the Lapon Rose Zone. Evidence of mining activities within this previously unknown zone were discovered with evidence of a collapsed mine portal.
 
Finally, another shear zone, some 3300 feet west of the Lapon Rose Zone, shows intense iron oxide mineralization and silicification, with the presence of a previously unknown adit into the center of this zone.
 
In the end of 2015, Walker River Resources Corp. completed an initial 5-hole reverse circulation (“RC”) drill program totaling 2,500 feet on the Lapon Canyon Gold Project. The drill program was designed to test and confirm mineralization in an around the historical workings and mining on the Lapon Gold Project. The initial drill results confirmed the potential for the emplacement of significant gold mineralization on the Lapon Project.

2016 Exploration Program
 
During 2016, we completed a 9-hole RC drill program totaling 3,400 feet on the Lapon Project. The drill program was designed to build on the results received from the 2015 drill program carried out by Walker River Resources Corp. continuing to test and confirm mineralization in and around the historical workings and mining on the Lapon Project.
 
RC drill hole LC 16-10 was designed to verify the position of previously reported, presently inaccessible mined out area. The drill hole successfully intersected the mined-out stope at the reported location and verified the width at some 26 feet at a depth of 223 feet. It is significant that the gold mineralization encountered in LC 16-10 was encountered from 180.12 to 220.14 feet, only 2.62 feet from the stope.
 
The additional drill results from the 2016 drill program continue to confirm the potential for the emplacement of significant gold mineralization on the Lapon Project.
 
Sampling Methodology, Chain of Custody, Quality Control and Quality Assurance
 
All sampling was conducted under the supervision of our project geologists and the chain of custody, from the drill to the sample preparation facility, was continuously monitored. A blank or certified reference material was inserted approximately every tenth sample. The Lapon samples were delivered to ALS Minerals certified laboratory facility in Reno, NV. The samples were crushed, pulverized and the sample pulps digested and analyzed for gold using fire assay fusion and a 50g gravimetric finish. Higher grade samples used a 1kg screen fire assay with screen to 100 microns and 50g gravimetric finish.
Competition
 
The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are competing with many other exploration companies looking for minerals. We are one of the smallest exploration companies and a very small participant in the mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral exploration company, we compete with other similar companies for financing and joint venture partners, and for resources such as professional geologists, camp staff, helicopters and mineral exploration contractors and supplies. We do not represent a competitive presence in the industry.
 
Raw materials
 
The raw materials for our exploration programs include camp equipment, hand exploration tools, sample bags, first aid supplies, groceries and propane. All of these types of materials are readily available from a variety of local suppliers.
 
Dependence on Customers
 
As a junior exploration company, we have no customers.
 
Trademarks and Patents
 
We have no intellectual property such as patents or trademarks and, other than the obligation under our option to acquire an interest in the Lapon Canyon Project that we discussed under the “Business” section, no royalty agreements or labor contracts.
Need For Any Government Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
We are not required to obtain permits or submit operational plans in order to conduct exploration on the Garfield Flats Project. The mining business, however, is subject to various levels of government controls and regulations, which are supplemented and revised from time to time. We cannot predict what additional legislation or revisions might be proposed that could affect our business or when any proposals, if enacted, might become effective. Such changes, however, could require more operating capital and expenditures and could prevent or delay some of our operations.

-8-
---


The various levels of government controls and regulations address, among other things, the environmental impact of mining and mineral processing operations. For mining and processing, legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish performance standards, air and water quality emission standards and other design or operational requirements for various components of operations, including health and safety standards. Legislation and regulations also establish requirements for decommissioning, reclaiming and rehabilitating mining properties following the cessation of operations, and may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods of time. As we are not mining or processing, and are unlikely to do so for some years, we have not investigated these regulations.
 
None of the exploration work that we have completed to date requires an environmental permit, however, we must ensure timely repair of any damage done to the land during exploration.
 
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all material government controls and regulations on the Garfield Flats Project.
 
Research and Development
 
We have not spent any money on research and development activities.
 
Employees
 
At the present time, we do not have any employees other than our sole officer who devotes his time as needed to our business and expects to devote 10 hours per week in 2018.
Legal Proceedings
 
We are not involved in any legal proceedings nor are we aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us. Neither our sole officer nor our directors are party to any legal proceeding or litigation. None of our directors or our sole officer has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor relating to securities or performance in corporate office.
