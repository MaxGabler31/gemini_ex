ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
 
See Item 7- MDA for a discussion of our business.
 
Regulation and Laws
 
The coal mining industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities on matters such as:
 

· | employee health and safety;
--+----------------------------


· | mine permits and other licensing requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | air quality standards;
--+-----------------------


· | water quality standards;
--+-------------------------


· | storage of petroleum products and substances that are regarded as hazardous under applicable laws or that, if spilled, could reach waterways or wetlands;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | plant and wildlife protection;
--+-------------------------------


· | reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | discharge of materials;
--+------------------------


· | storage and handling of explosives;
--+------------------------------------


· | wetlands protection;
--+---------------------


· | surface subsidence from underground mining; and
--+------------------------------------------------


· | the effects, if any, that mining has on groundwater quality and availability.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the utility industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which has adversely affected demand for coal.  It is possible that new legislation or regulations may be adopted, or that existing laws or regulations may be interpreted differently or more stringently enforced, any of which could have a significant impact on our mining operations or our customers’ ability to use coal. For more information, please see risk factors described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.
 
We are committed to conducting mining operations in compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.  However, because of the extensive and detailed nature of these regulatory requirements, particularly the regulatory system of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) where citations can be issued without regard to fault, and many of the standards include subjective elements, it is not reasonable to expect any coal mining company to be free of citations.  When we receive a citation, we attempt to remediate any identified condition immediately.  While we have not quantified all the costs of compliance with applicable federal and state laws and associated regulations, those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant.  Compliance with these laws and regulations has substantially increased the cost of coal mining for domestic coal producers.
 
Capital expenditures for environmental matters have not been material in recent years.  We have accrued for the present value of the estimated cost of asset retirement obligations and mine closings, including the cost of treating mine water discharge, when necessary.  The accruals for asset retirement obligations and mine closing costs are based upon permit requirements and the costs and timing of asset retirement obligations and mine closing procedures.  Although management believes it has made adequate provisions for all expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures, future operating results would be adversely affected if these accruals were insufficient.

Mining Permits and Approvals
 
Numerous governmental permits or approvals are required for mining operations.  Applications for permits require extensive engineering and data analysis and presentation and must address a variety of environmental, health and safety matters associated with a proposed mining operation.  These matters include the manner and sequencing of coal extraction, the storage, use and disposal of waste and other substances and impacts on the environment, the construction of water containment areas, and reclamation of the area after coal extraction.  Meeting all requirements imposed by any of these authorities may be costly and time-consuming, and may delay or prevent commencement or continuation of mining operations.
 
The permitting process for certain mining operations can extend over several years and can be subject to administrative and judicial challenge, including by the public.  Some required mining permits are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in a timely manner, or at all.  We cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulty or delays in obtaining mining permits in the future or that a current permit will not be revoked.
 
We are required to post bonds to secure performance under our permits.  Under some circumstances, substantial fines and penalties, including revocation of mining permits, may be imposed under the laws and regulations described above.  Monetary sanctions and, in severe circumstances, criminal sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.  Regulations also provide that a mining permit can be refused or revoked if the permit applicant or permittee owns or controls, directly or indirectly through other entities, mining operations that have outstanding environmental violations.  Although like other coal companies, we have been cited for violations in the ordinary course of our business, we have never had a permit suspended or revoked because of any violation, and the penalties assessed for these violations have not been material.
 
Mine Health and Safety Laws
 
Stringent safety and health standards have been imposed by federal legislation since the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 (“CMHSA”) was adopted.  The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (“FMSHA”), and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, significantly expanded the enforcement of health and safety standards of the CMHSA, and imposed extensive and detailed safety and health standards on numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, blasting, the equipment used in mining operations, and numerous other matters.  MSHA monitors and rigorously enforces compliance with these federal laws and regulations.  In addition, the states where we operate have state programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement.  Federal and state safety and health regulations affecting the coal mining industry are perhaps the most comprehensive and rigorous system in the U.S. for protection of employee safety and have a significant effect on our operating costs.  Although many of the requirements primarily impact underground mining, our competitors in all of the areas in which we operate are subject to the same laws and regulations.
 
The FMSHA has been construed as authorizing MSHA to issue citations and orders pursuant to the legal doctrine of strict liability, or liability without fault, and FMSHA requires imposition of a civil penalty for each cited violation.  Negligence and gravity assessments, and other factors can result in the issuance of various types of orders, including orders requiring withdrawal from the mine or the affected area, and some orders can also result in the imposition of civil penalties.  The FMSHA also contains criminal liability provisions.  For example, criminal liability may be imposed upon corporate operators who knowingly and willfully authorize, order or carry out violations of the FMSHA, or its mandatory health and safety standards.
 
The Federal Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (“MINER Act”) significantly amended the FMSHA, imposing more extensive and stringent compliance standards, increasing criminal penalties and establishing a maximum civil penalty for non-compliance, and expanding the scope of federal oversight, inspection, and enforcement activities.  Following the passage of the MINER Act, MSHA has issued new or more stringent rules and policies on a variety of topics, including:
 

· | sealing off abandoned areas of underground coal mines;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | mine safety equipment, training, and emergency reporting requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | substantially increased civil penalties for regulatory violations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | training and availability of mine rescue teams;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | underground “refuge alternatives” capable of sustaining trapped miners in the event of an emergency;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | flame-resistant conveyor belts, fire prevention and detection, and use of air from the belt entry; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | post-accident two-way communications and electronic tracking systems.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

MSHA continues to interpret and implement various provisions of the MINER Act, along with introducing new proposed regulations and standards.
 
In 2014, MSHA began implementation of a finalized new regulation titled “Lowering Miner’s Exposure to Respirable Coal Mine Dust, Including Continuous Personal Dust Monitors.”  The final rule implements a reduction in the allowable respirable coal mine dust exposure limits, requires the use of sampling data taken from a single sample rather than an average of samples, and increases oversight by MSHA regarding coal mine dust and ventilation issues at each mine, including the approval process for ventilation plans at each mine, all of which increase mining costs. The second phase of the rule began in February 2016 and requires additional sampling for designated and other occupations using the new continuous personal dust monitor technology, which provides real-time dust exposure information to the miner.  Phase three of the rule began in August 2016 and resulted in lowering the current respirable dust level of 2.0 milligrams per cubic meter to 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter of air.  Compliance with these rules can result in increased costs on our operations, including, but not limited to, the purchasing of new equipment and the hiring of additional personnel to assist with monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations.
 
Additionally, in July 2014, MSHA proposed a rule addressing the “criteria and procedures for assessment of civil penalties.”  Public commenters have expressed concern that the proposed rule exceeds MSHA’s rulemaking authority and would result in substantially increased civil penalties for regulatory violations cited by MSHA.  MSHA last revised the process for proposing civil penalties in 2006 and, as discussed above, civil penalties increased significantly.  The notice-and-comment period for this proposed rule has closed, and it is uncertain when MSHA will present a final rule addressing these civil penalties.
 
In January 2015, MSHA published a final rule requiring mine operators to install proximity detection systems on continuous mining machines, over a staggered time frame ranging from November 2015 through March 2018.  The proximity detection systems initiate a warning or shutdown the continuous mining machine depending on the proximity of the machine to a miner. MSHA subsequently proposed a rule requiring mine operators to also install proximity detection systems on other types of underground mobile mining equipment.  The comment period for this proposed rule closed on April 10, 2017, and it is uncertain when MSHA will promulgate a final rule addressing the issue of proximity detection systems on underground mobile mining equipment, other than continuous mining machines.
 
In June 2016, MSHA published a request for information on Exposure of Underground Miners to Diesel Exhaust.  Following a comment period that closed in November 2016, MSHA received requests for MSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to hold a Diesel Exhaust Partnership to address the issues covered by MSHA's request for information.  The comment period for the request for information was reopened and closed in January 2018.  It is uncertain whether MSHA will present a proposed rule pertaining to exposure of underground miners to diesel exhaust, after completing its evaluation of the comments received.
 
Subsequent to passage of the MINER Act, Illinois, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and West Virginia have enacted legislation addressing issues such as mine safety and accident reporting, increased civil and criminal penalties, and increased inspections and oversight. Additionally, state administrative agencies can promulgate administrative rules and regulations affecting our operations.  Other states may pass similar legislation or administrative regulations in the future.
 
Some of the costs of complying with existing regulations and implementing new safety and health regulations may be passed on to our customers.  Although we have not quantified the full impact, implementing and complying with these new state and federal safety laws and regulations have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.
 
Black Lung Benefits Act
 
The Black Lung Benefits Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981 (“BLBA”) requires businesses that conduct current mining operations to make payments of black lung benefits to current and former coal miners with black lung disease and to some survivors of a miner who dies from this disease.  The BLBA levies a tax on production of $1.10 per ton for underground-mined coal and $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, but not to exceed 4.4% of the applicable sales price, in order to compensate miners who are totally disabled due to black lung disease and some survivors of miners who died from this disease, and who were last employed as miners prior to 1970 or subsequently where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims.  In addition, the BLBA provides that some claims for which coal operators had previously been responsible are or will become obligations of the government trust funded by the tax.  The Revenue Act of 1987 extended the termination date of this tax from January 1, 1996, to the earlier of January 1, 2014, or the date on which the government trust becomes solvent.  We are also liable under state statutes for black lung claims.  Congress and state legislatures regularly consider various items of black lung legislation, which, if enacted, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.

5
-

 

The revised BLBA regulations took effect in January 2001, relaxing the stringent award criteria established under previous regulations and thus potentially allowing new federal claims to be awarded and allowing previously denied claimants to re-file under the revised criteria.  These regulations may also increase black lung related medical costs by broadening the scope of conditions for which medical costs are reimbursable and increase legal costs by shifting more of the burden of proof to the employer.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010, includes significant changes to the federal black lung program, retroactive to 2005, including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and establishes a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of coal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition.  These changes could have a material impact on our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program.
 
Workers’ Compensation
 
We provide income replacement and medical treatment for work-related traumatic injury claims as required by applicable state laws.  Workers’ compensation laws also compensate survivors of workers who suffer employment-related deaths.  States in which we operate consider changes in workers’ compensation laws from time to time.
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act
 
The Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (“SMCRA”) and similar state statutes establish operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as many aspects of deep mining.  Although we have minimal surface mining activity and no mountaintop removal mining activity, SMCRA nevertheless requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and upon completion of our mining activities.
 
SMCRA and similar state statutes require, among other things, that mined property be restored in accordance with specified standards and approved reclamation plans.  SMCRA requires us to restore the surface to approximate the original contours as contemporaneously as practicable with the completion of surface mining operations.  Federal law and some states impose on mine operators the responsibility for replacing certain water supplies damaged by mining operations and repairing or compensating for damage to certain structures occurring on the surface as a result of mine subsidence, a consequence of longwall mining and possibly other mining operations.  We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations relating to reclamation.
 
In addition, the Abandoned Mine Lands Program, which is part of SMCRA, imposes a tax on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are used to restore mines closed before 1977.  The tax for surface-mined and underground-mined coal is $0.28 per ton and $0.12 per ton, respectively.  We have accrued the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing, including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary. In addition, states from time to time have increased and may continue to increase their fees and taxes to fund reclamation or orphaned mine sites and acid mine drainage control on a statewide basis. 
 
Under SMCRA, responsibility for unabated violations, unpaid civil penalties and unpaid reclamation fees of independent contract mine operators and other third parties can be imputed to other companies that are deemed, according to the regulations, to have “owned” or “controlled” the third-party violator.  Sanctions against the “owner” or “controller” are quite severe and can include being blocked from receiving new permits and having any permits revoked that were issued after the time of the violations or after the time civil penalties or reclamation fees became due.  We are not aware of any currently pending or asserted claims against us relating to the “ownership” or “control” theories discussed above.  However, we cannot assure you that such claims will not be asserted in the future.
 
The U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation (“OSM”) published in November 2009 an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, announcing its intent to revise the Stream Buffer Zone (“SBZ”) rule published in December 2008.  The SBZ rule prohibits mining disturbances within 100 feet of streams if there would be a negative effect on water quality.  Environmental groups brought lawsuits challenging the rule, and in a March 2010 settlement, the OSM agreed to rewrite the SBZ rule.  In January 2013, the environmental groups reopened the litigation against OSM for failure to abide by the terms of the settlement.  Oral arguments were heard on January 31, 2014.  OSM published a notice on December 22, 2014, to vacate the 2008 SBZ rule to comply with an order issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  OSM reimplemented the 1983 SBZ rule.

OSM issued its final Stream Protection Rule ("SPR") in December 2016 to replace the vacated SBZ rule.  The rule would have generally prohibited the approval of permits issued pursuant to SMCRA where the proposed operations would result in "material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area." Pursuant to the rule, permittees would have also been required to restore any perennial or intermittent streams that a permittee mined through. Finally, the rule would have also imposed additional baseline data collection, surface/groundwater monitoring, and bonding and financial assurance requirements. However, in February 2017, both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate passed resolutions disapproving the SPR under the Congressional Review Act ("CRA"). President Trump signed the resolution on February 16, 2017, and, pursuant to the CRA, the SPR "shall have no force or effect" and OSM cannot promulgate a substantially similar rule absent future legislation.  Whether Congress will enact future legislation to require a new SPR rule remains uncertain.
 
Following the spill of coal combustion residues (“CCRs”) in the Tennessee Valley Authority impoundment in Kingston, Tennessee, in December 2009, the EPA issued proposed rules on CCRs in 2010.  This final rule was published on December 19, 2014.  The EPA's final rule does not address the placement of CCRs in minefills or non-minefill uses of CCRs at coal mine sites.  OSM has announced their intention to release a proposed rule to regulate placement and use of CCRs at coal mine sites, but, to date, no further action has been taken.  These actions by OSM, potentially could result in additional delays and costs associated with obtaining permits, prohibitions or restrictions relating to mining activities, and additional enforcement actions.
 
Bonding Requirements
 
Federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining, and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations.  These bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis.  It has become increasingly difficult for us and for our competitors to secure new surety bonds without posting collateral.  In addition, surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable to us.  It is possible that surety bond issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals.  Our failure to maintain or inability to acquire, surety bonds that are required by state and federal laws would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal, which could affect our profitability and cash flow.
Air Emissions
 
The CAA and similar state and local laws and regulations regulate emissions into the air and affect coal mining operations.  The CAA directly impacts our coal mining and processing operations by imposing permitting requirements and, in some cases, requirements to install certain emissions control equipment, achieve certain emissions standards, or implement certain work practices on sources that emit various air pollutants.  The CAA also indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants and other coal-burning facilities.  There have been a series of federal rulemakings focused on emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities.  Installation of additional emissions control technology and any additional measures required under applicable state and federal laws and regulations related to air emissions will make it costlier to operate coal-fired power plants and possibly other facilities that consume coal and, depending on the requirements of individual state implementation plans (“SIPs”), could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future.  A significant reduction in coal’s share of power generating capacity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Since 2010, utilities have formally announced the retirement or conversion of over 600 coal-fired electric generating units through 2030.
 
In addition to the greenhouse gas (“GHG”) issues discussed below, the air emissions programs that may affect our operations, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

· | The EPA’s Acid Rain Program, provided in Title IV of the CAA, regulates emissions of sulfur dioxide from electric generating facilities. Sulfur dioxide is a by-product of coal combustion. Affected facilities purchase or are otherwise allocated sulfur dioxide emissions allowances, which must be surrendered annually in an amount equal to a facility’s sulfur dioxide emissions in that year. Affected facilities may sell or trade excess allowances to other facilities that require additional allowances to offset their sulfur dioxide emissions. In addition to purchasing or trading for additional sulfur dioxide allowances, affected power facilities can satisfy the requirements of the EPA’s Acid Rain Program by switching to lower-sulfur fuels, installing pollution control devices such as flue gas desulfurization systems, or “scrubbers,” or by reducing electricity generating levels. These requirements would not be supplanted by a replacement rule for the Clean Air Interstate Rule (“CAIR”), discussed below. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | The CAIR calls for power plants in 28 states and Washington, D.C. to reduce emission levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pursuant to a cap-and-trade program similar to the system in effect for acid rain. In June 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”), a replacement rule for CAIR, which would have required 28 states in the Midwest and eastern seaboard to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. Under CSAPR, the first phase of the nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions reductions would have commenced in 2012 with further reductions effective in 2014. However, in August 2012, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated CSAPR, finding the EPA exceeded its statutory authority under the CAA and striking down the EPA’s decision to require federal implementation plans (“FIPs”), rather than SIPs, to implement mandated reductions. In its ruling, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the EPA to continue administering CAIR but proceed expeditiously to promulgate a replacement rule for CAIR. The U.S. Supreme Court granted the EPA’s certiorari petition appealing the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision and heard oral arguments on December 10, 2013. In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision, concluding that the EPA’s approach is lawful. CSAPR has been reinstated and the EPA began implementation of Phase 1 requirements in January 2015. In September 2016, the EPA finalized the CSAPR Update to respond to the remand by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Implementation of Phase 2 began in 2017. Further litigation is expected against the CSAPR Update in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The impacts of CSAPR Update are unknown at the present time due to the implementation of Mercury and Air Toxic Standards ("MATS"), discussed below, and the significant number of coal retirements that have resulted and that potentially will result from MATS. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In February 2012, the EPA adopted the MATS, which regulates the emission of mercury and other metals, fine particulates, and acid gases such as hydrogen chloride from coal and oil-fired power plants. In March 2013, the EPA finalized a reconsideration of the MATS rule as it pertains to new power plants, principally adjusting emissions limits to levels attainable by existing control technologies. Appeals were filed, and oral arguments were heard by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in December 2013. On April 15, 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld MATS. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court remanded the final rule back to the D.C. Circuit holding that the agency must consider cost before deciding whether regulation is necessary and appropriate. On December 1, 2015, the EPA issued, for comment, the proposed Supplemental Finding. In April 2016, the EPA issued a final supplemental finding upholding the rule and concluding that a cost analysis supports the MATS rule. In April 2017, the D.C Circuit Court of Appeals granted EPA's request to cancel oral arguments and ordered the case held in abeyance for an EPA review of the supplemental finding. Many electric generators have already announced retirements due to the MATS rule. Although various issues surrounding the MATS rule remain subject to litigation in the D.C. Circuit, the MATS will force generators to make capital investments to retrofit power plants and could lead to additional premature retirements of older coal-fired generating units. The announced and possible additional retirements are likely to reduce the demand for coal. Apart from MATS, several states have enacted or proposed regulations requiring reductions in mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, and federal legislation to reduce mercury emissions from power plants has been proposed. Regulation of mercury emissions by the EPA, states, or Congress may decrease the future demand for coal. We continue to evaluate the possible scenarios associated with CSAPR and MATS and the effects they may have on our business and our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

· | In January 2013, the EPA issued final Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“MACT”) standards for several classes of boilers and process heaters, including large coal-fired boilers and process heaters (“Boiler MACT”), which require owners of industrial, commercial, and institutional boilers to comply with standards for air pollutants, including mercury and other metals, fine particulates, and acid gases such as hydrogen chloride. Businesses and environmental groups have filed legal challenges to Boiler MACT in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and petitioned the EPA to reconsider the rule. On December 1, 2014, the EPA announced a reconsideration of the standard and will accept public comment on five issues for its standards on area sources, will review three issues related to its major-source boiler standards, and four issues relating to commercial and solid waste incinerator units. Before reconsideration, the EPA estimated the rule would affect 1,700 existing major source facilities with an estimated 14,316 boilers and process heaters. While some owners would make capital expenditures to retrofit boilers and process heaters, a number of boilers and process heaters could be prematurely retired. Retirements are likely to reduce the demand for coal. In August 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a portion of the rule while remanding portions back to the EPA. In December 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to the EPA request to remand the rule back to the EPA without vacatur. The impact of the regulations will depend on the EPA's reconsideration and the outcome of subsequent legal challenges. The impact of the regulations will depend on the EPA’s reconsideration and the outcome of subsequent legal challenges.

· | The EPA is required by the CAA to periodically re-evaluate the available health effects information to determine whether the national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) should be revised. Pursuant to this process, the EPA has adopted more stringent NAAQS for fine particulate matter (“PM”), ozone, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide. As a result, some states will be required to amend their existing SIPs to attain and maintain compliance with the new air quality standards and other states will be required to develop new SIPs for areas that were previously in “attainment” but do not attain the new standards. In addition, under the revised ozone NAAQS, significant additional emissions control expenditures may be required at coal-fired power plants. Initial non-attainment determinations related to the revised sulfur dioxide standard became effective in October 2013. In addition, in January 2013, the EPA updated the NAAQS for fine particulate matter emitted by a wide variety of sources including power plants, industrial facilities, and gasoline and diesel engines, tightening the annual PM 2.5 standard to 12 micrograms per cubic meter. The revised standard became effective in March 2013. In November 2013, the EPA proposed a rule to clarify PM 2.5 implementation requirements to the states for current 1997 and 2006 non-attainment areas. In July 2016, the EPA issued a final rule for states to use in creating their plans to address the particulate matter. On October 26, 2015, the EPA published a final rule that reduced the ozone NAAQS from 75 to 70 ppb. Murray Energy filed a challenge to the final rule in the D.C. Circuit. Since that time, other industry and state petitioners have filed challenges as have several environmental groups. Attainment dates for the new standards range between 2013 and 2030, depending on the severity of the non-attainment. In April 2017, the D.C. Court of Appeals granted EPA's request to cancel oral arguments and ordered the case held in abeyance for an EPA review of the 2015 Rule. In July 2009, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated part of a rule implementing the ozone NAAQS and remanded certain other aspects of the rule to the EPA for further consideration. In June 2013, the EPA proposed a rule for implementing the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Under a consent decree published in the Federal Register in January 2017, the EPA has agreed to review the NAAQS for nitrogen oxides with a final decision due by 2018 and review the NAAQS for sulfur oxide with a final decision due by 2019. In July 2017, the EPA proposed to retain the current NAAQS for nitrogen oxides. The comment period for the proposal closed in September 2017. New standards may impose additional emissions control requirements on new and expanded coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers. Because coal mining operations and coal-fired electric generating facilities emit particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, our mining operations and our customers could be affected when the new standards are implemented by the applicable states, and developments might indirectly reduce the demand for coal.

· | The EPA’s regional haze program is designed to protect and improve visibility at and around national parks, national wilderness areas, and international parks. Under the program, states are required to develop SIPs to improve visibility. Typically, these plans call for reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-fueled electric plants. In recent cases, the EPA has decided to negate the SIPs and impose stringent requirements through FIPs. The regional haze program, including particularly the EPA’s FIPs, and any future regulations may restrict the construction of new coal-fired power plants whose operation may impair visibility at and around federally protected areas and may require some existing coal-fired power plants to install additional control measures designed to limit haze-causing emissions. These requirements could limit the demand for coal in some locations.

· | The EPA’s new source review (“NSR”) program under the CAA in certain circumstances requires existing coal-fired power plants, when modifications to those plants significantly increase emissions, to install more stringent air emissions control equipment. The Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, has filed lawsuits against a number of coal-fired electric generating facilities alleging violations of the NSR program. The EPA has alleged that certain modifications have been made to these facilities without first obtaining certain permits issued under the program. Several of these lawsuits have settled, but others remain pending. Depending on the ultimate resolution of these cases, demand for coal could be affected.

Carbon Dioxide Emissions
 
Combustion of fossil fuels, such as the coal we produce, results in the emission of carbon dioxide, which is considered a GHG.  Combustion of fuel for mining equipment used in coal production also emits GHGs.  Future regulation of GHG emissions in the U.S. could occur pursuant to future U.S. treaty commitments, new domestic legislation or regulation by the EPA.  Congress has considered various proposals to reduce GHG emissions, and it is possible federal legislation could be adopted in the future.  Internationally, the Kyoto Protocol set binding emission targets for developed countries that ratified it (the U.S. did not ratify, and Canada officially withdrew from its Kyoto commitment in 2012) to reduce their global GHG emissions.  The Kyoto Protocol was nominally extended past its expiration date of December 2012, with a requirement for a new legal construct to be put into place by 2015.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change met in Paris, France in December 2015 and agreed to an international climate agreement (Paris Agreement).  Although this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions.  These commitments could further reduce demand and prices for our coal. In June of 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which has a four-year exit process.   Future participation in the Paris Agreement by the U.S. remains uncertain.  However, many states, regions and governmental bodies have adopted GHG initiatives and have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of GHGs by certain facilities, including coal-fired electric generating facilities.  Depending on the particular regulatory program that may be enacted, at either the federal or state level, the demand for coal could be negatively impacted, which would have an adverse effect on our operations.
 
Even in the absence of new federal legislation, the EPA has begun to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency that the EPA has authority to regulate GHG emissions.  In 2009, the EPA issued a final rule, known as the “Endangerment Finding”,” declaring that GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, endanger public health and welfare and that six GHGs, including carbon dioxide and methane, emitted by motor vehicles endanger both the public health and welfare.
 
In May 2010, the EPA issued its final “tailoring rule” for GHG emissions, a policy aimed at shielding small emission sources from CAA permitting requirements.  The EPA’s rule phases in various GHG-related permitting requirements beginning in January 2011.  Beginning July 1, 2011, the EPA requires facilities that must already obtain NSR permits (new or modified stationary sources) for other pollutants to include GHGs in their permits for new construction projects that emit at least 100,000 tons per year of GHGs and existing facilities that increase their emissions by at least 75,000 tons per year.  These permits require that the permittee adopt the Best Available Control Technology (“BACT”).  In June 2012, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld these permitting regulations.  In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the EPA’s position that power plants and other sources can be subject to permitting requirements based on their GHG emissions alone.  For CO2 BACT to apply, CAA permitting must be triggered by another regulated pollutant (e.g., SO2). 
 
As a result of revisions to its preconstruction permitting rules that became fully effective in 2011, the EPA now requires new sources, including coal-fired power plants, to undergo control technology reviews for GHGs (predominantly carbon dioxide) as a condition of permit issuance.  These reviews may impose limits on GHG emissions, or otherwise be used to compel consideration of alternative fuels and generation systems, as well as increase litigation risk for and so discourage development of coal-fired power plants. The EPA has also issued final rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain sources.
 
In March 2012, the EPA proposed New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) for carbon dioxide emissions from new fossil fuel-fired power plants.  The proposal requires new coal units to meet a carbon dioxide emissions standard of 1,000 lbs. CO2/MWh, which is equivalent to the carbon dioxide emitted by a natural gas combined cycle unit.  In January 2014, the EPA formally published its re-proposed NSPS for carbon dioxide emissions from new power plants.  The re-proposed rule requires an emissions standard of 1,100 lbs. CO2/MWh for new coal-fired power plants.  To meet such a standard, new coal plants would be required to install carbon capture and storage (“CCS”) technology. In August 2015, the EPA released final rules requiring newly constructed coal-fired steam electric generating units (“EGUs”) to emit no more than 1,400 lbs CO2/MWh (gross) and be constructed with CCS to capture 16% of CO2 produced by an electric generating unit burning bituminous coal.  At the same time, the EPA finalized GHG emissions regulations for modified and existing power plants.  The rule for modified sources required reducing GHG emissions from any modified or reconstructed source and could limit the ability of generators to upgrade coal-fired power plants thereby reducing the demand for coal.  In April 2017, the EPA published notice in the federal register that the agency has initiated a review of the NSPS for new and modified fossil fuel-fired power plants and that, following the review, the EPA will initiate reconsideration proceedings to suspend, revise or rescind this NSPS.  Challenges to the NSPS have been filed in U.S. Court of Appeal for the D.C. Circuit and oral arguments were set for April 2017; however, in April 2017, the U.S Court of Appeal for the D.C. Circuit ordered the NSPS case held in abeyance for an EPA review of the rule.  It is likely than any repeal or revisions to the NSPS will be subject to legal challenges as well.  Future implementation of the NSPS is uncertain at this time.

In August 2015, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan ("CPP") rules that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants, called CO2 emission performance rates.  Judicial challenges led the U.S. Supreme Court to grant a stay in February 2016 of the implementation of the CPP before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ("Circuit Court") even issued a decision.  By its terms, this stay will remain in effect throughout the pendency of the appeals process including at the Circuit Court and the Supreme Court through any certiorari petition that may be granted.   The Supreme Court's stay applies only to EPA's regulations for CO2 emissions from existing power plants and will not affect EPA's standards for new power plants.  It is not yet clear how either the Circuit Court or the Supreme Court will rule on the legality of the CPP. Additionally, in October 2017 the EPA proposed to repeal the CPP, although the final outcome of this action and the pending litigation regarding the CPP is uncertain at this time.   In connection with this proposed repeal, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("ANPRM") in December 2017 regarding emission guidelines to limit GHG emissions from existing electricity utility generating units.  The ANPRM seeks comment regarding what the EPA should include in a potential new, existing-source regulation under the Clean Air Act of GHG emissions from electric utility generating units that it may propose.  If the effort to repeal the rules is unsuccessful and the rules were upheld at the conclusion of this appellate process and were implemented in their current form, or if the ANPRM results in a different proposal to control GHG emissions from electric utility generating units, demand for coal would likely be further decreased, potentially significantly, and our business would be adversely impacted.
 
Collectively, these requirements have led to premature retirements and could lead to additional premature retirements of coal-fired generating units and reduce the demand for coal.  Congress has rejected legislation to restrict carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants, and it is unclear whether the EPA has the legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions for existing and modified power plants as proposed in the NSPS and CPP. Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the coal we produce.
 
There have been numerous protests of and challenges to the permitting of new coal-fired power plants by environmental organizations and state regulators for concerns related to GHG emissions.  For instance, various state regulatory authorities have rejected the construction of new coal-fueled power plants based on the uncertainty surrounding the potential costs associated with GHG emissions from these plants under future laws limiting the emissions of carbon dioxide.  In addition, several permits issued to new coal-fueled power plants without limits on GHG emissions have been appealed to the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board.  In addition, over thirty states have currently adopted “renewable energy standards” or “renewable portfolio standards,” which encourage or require electric utilities to obtain a certain percentage of their electric generation portfolio from renewable resources by a certain date.  These standards generally range from 10% to 30%, over time periods that generally extend from the present until between 2020 and 2030.  Other states may adopt similar requirements, and federal legislation is a possibility in this area.  To the extent these requirements affect our current and prospective customers, they may reduce the demand for coal-fired power, and may affect long-term demand for our coal.  Finally, a federal appeals court allowed a lawsuit pursuing federal common law claim to proceed against certain utilities on the basis that they may have created a public nuisance due to their emissions of carbon dioxide, while a second federal appeals court dismissed a similar case on procedural grounds.  The U.S. Supreme Court overturned that decision in June 2011, holding that federal common law provides no basis for public nuisance claims against utilities due to their carbon dioxide emissions.  The Supreme Court did not, however, decide whether similar claims can be brought under state common law.  As a result, despite this favorable ruling, tort-type liabilities remain a concern.
 
In addition, environmental advocacy groups have filed a variety of judicial challenges claiming that the environmental analyses conducted by federal agencies before granting permits and other approvals necessary for certain coal activities do not satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”).  These groups assert that the environmental analyses in question do not adequately consider the climate change impacts of these particular projects.  In December 2014, the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) released updated draft guidance discussing how federal agencies should consider the effects of GHG emissions and climate change in their NEPA evaluations.  The guidance encourages agencies to provide a more detailed discussion of the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of a proposed action’s reasonably foreseeable emissions and effects.  This guidance could create additional delays and costs in the NEPA review process or in our operations, or even an inability to obtain necessary federal approvals for our future operations, including due to the increased risk of legal challenges from environmental groups seeking additional analysis of climate impacts. In April 2017, CEQ withdrew its final 2016 guidance on how federal agencies should incorporate climate change and GHG considerations into NEPA reviews of federal actions.
 
Many states and regions have adopted GHG initiatives, and certain governmental bodies have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of GHG by certain facilities, including coal-fired electric generating facilities.  For example, in 2005, ten Northeastern states entered into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative agreement (“RGGI”), calling for the implementation of a cap and trade program aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in the participating states.  The members of RGGI have established in statutes and/or regulations a carbon dioxide trading program.  Auctions for carbon dioxide allowances under the program began in September 2008.  Though New Jersey withdrew from RGGI in 2011, since its inception, several additional northeastern states and Canadian provinces have joined as participants or observers. New Jersey has announced its intention to rejoin RGGI following the change in state government administrations.

Following the RGGI model, five Western states launched the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative to identify, evaluate, and implement collective and cooperative methods of reducing GHG in the region to 15% below 2005 levels by 2020.  These states were joined by two additional states and four Canadian provinces and became collectively known as the Western Climate Initiative Partners. However, in November 2011, six states withdrew, leaving California and the four Canadian provinces as members. At a January 2012 stakeholder meeting, this group confirmed a commitment and timetable to create the largest carbon market in North America and provide a model to guide future efforts to establish national approaches in both Canada and the U.S. to reduce GHG emissions.  It is likely that these regional efforts will continue.
 
It is possible that future international, federal and state initiatives to control GHG emissions could result in increased costs associated with coal production and consumption, such as costs to install additional controls to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or costs to purchase emissions reduction credits to comply with future emissions trading programs.  Such increased costs for coal consumption could result in some customers switching to alternative sources of fuel, or otherwise adversely affect our operations and demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
Water Discharge
 
The Federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and similar state and local laws and regulations affect coal mining operations by imposing restrictions on effluent discharge into waters and the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the U.S.  Regular monitoring, as well as compliance with reporting requirements and performance standards, is a precondition for the issuance and renewal of permits governing the discharge of pollutants into water.  Section 404 of the CWA imposes permitting and mitigation requirements associated with the dredging and filling of wetlands and streams.  The CWA and equivalent state legislation, where such equivalent state legislation exists, affect coal mining operations that impact wetlands and streams.  Although permitting requirements have been tightened in recent years, we believe we have obtained all necessary permits required under CWA Section 404 as it has traditionally been interpreted by the responsible agencies.  However, mitigation requirements under existing and possible future “fill” permits may vary considerably.  For that reason, the setting of post-mine asset retirement obligation accruals for such mitigation projects is difficult to ascertain with certainty and may increase in the future. Although more stringent permitting requirements may be imposed in the future, we are not able to accurately predict the impact, if any, of such permitting requirements.
 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps of Engineers”) maintains two permitting programs under CWA Section 404 for the discharge of dredged or fill material: one for “individual” permits and a more streamlined program for “general” permits.  In June 2010, the Corps of Engineers suspended the use of “general” permits under Nationwide Permit 21 (“NWP 21”) in the Appalachian states.  In February 2012, the Corps of Engineers reissued the final 2012 NWP 21.  The Center for Biological Diversity later filed a notice of intent to sue the Corps of Engineers based on allegations the 2012 NWP 21 program violated the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”).  The Corps of Engineers and National Marine Fisheries Service (“NMFS”) have completed their programmatic ESA Section 7 consultation process on the Corps of Engineers’ 2012 NWP 21 package, and NMFS has issued a revised biological opinion finding that the NWP 21 program does not jeopardize the continued existence of threatened and endangered species and will not result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat. However, the opinion contains 12 additional protective measures the Corps of Engineers will implement in certain districts to “enhance the protection of listed species and critical habitat.” While these measures will not affect previously verified permit activities where construction has not yet been completed, several Corps of Engineers districts with mining operations will be impacted by the additional protective measures going forward. These measures include additional reporting and notification requirements, potential imposition of new regional conditions and additional actions concerning cumulative effects analyses and mitigation.  Our coal mining operations typically require Section 404 permits to authorize activities such as the creation of slurry ponds and stream impoundments.  The CWA authorizes the EPA to review Section 404 permits issued by the Corps of Engineers, and in 2009, the EPA began reviewing Section 404 permits issued by the Corps of Engineers for coal mining in Appalachia.  Currently, significant uncertainty exists regarding the obtaining of permits under the CWA for coal mining operations in Appalachia due to various initiatives launched by the EPA regarding these permits.

The EPA also has statutory “veto” power over a Section 404 permit if the EPA determines, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, that the permit will have an “unacceptable adverse effect.”  In January 2011, the EPA exercised its veto power to withdraw or restrict the use of a previously issued permit for Spruce No. 1 Surface Mine in West Virginia, which is one of the largest surface mining operations ever authorized in Appalachia.  This action was the first time that such power was exercised with regard to a previously permitted coal mining project.  A challenge to the EPA’s exercise of this authority was made in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and in March 2012, that court ruled that the EPA lacked the statutory authority to invalidate an already issued Section 404 permit retroactively.  In April 2013, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision and authorized the EPA to retroactively veto portions of a Section 404 permit.  The U.S. Supreme Court denied a request to review this decision.  Any future use of the EPA’s Section 404 “veto” power could create uncertainly with regard to our continued use of current permits, as well as impose additional time and cost burdens on future operations, potentially adversely affecting our coal revenue.  In addition, the EPA initiated a preemptive veto prior to the filing of any actual permit application for a copper and gold mine based on fictitious mine scenario. The implications of this decision could allow the EPA to bypass the state permitting process and engage in watershed and land use planning.
 
Total Maximum Daily Load (“TMDL”) regulations under the CWA establish a process to calculate the maximum amount of a pollutant that an impaired water body can receive and still meet state water quality standards and to allocate pollutant loads among the point and non-point pollutant sources discharging into that water body.  Likewise, when water quality in a receiving stream is better than required, states are required to conduct an antidegradation review before approving discharge permits. The adoption of new TMDL-related allocations or any changes to antidegradation policies for streams near our coal mines could require more costly water treatment and could adversely affect our coal production.
 
Considerable legal uncertainty exists surrounding the standard for what constitutes jurisdictional waters and wetlands subject to the protections and requirements of the Clean Water Act. A 2015 rulemaking by EPA to revise the standard was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and stayed for certain primarily western states by a United States District Court in North Dakota. In January 2018, the Supreme Court determined that the circuit courts do not have jurisdiction to hear challenges to the 2015 rule, removing the basis for the Sixth Circuit to continue its nationwide stay. Additionally, EPA has promulgated a final rule that extends the applicability date of the 2015 rule for another two years in order to allow EPA to undertake a rulemaking on the question of what constitutes a water of the United States. In the meantime, judicial challenges to the 2015 rulemaking are likely to continue to work their way through the courts along with challenges to the recent rulemaking that extends the applicability date of the 2015 rule. For now, EPA and the Corps of Engineers will continue to apply the existing standard for what constitutes a water of the United States as determined by the Supreme Court in the Rapanos case and post-Rapanos guidance. Should the 2015 rule take effect, or should a different rule expanding the definition of what constitutes a water of the United States be promulgated as a result of EPA and the Corps of Engineers' rulemaking process, we could face increased costs and delays due to additional permitting and regulatory requirements and possible challenges to permitting decisions.
 
Hazardous Substances and Wastes
 
The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), otherwise known as the “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.  Persons who are or were responsible for the release of hazardous substances may be subject to joint and several liabilities under CERCLA for the costs of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances and natural resource damages.  Some products used in coal mining operations generate waste containing hazardous substances.  We are currently unaware of any material liability associated with the release or disposal of hazardous substances from our past or present mine sites.
 
The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and corresponding state laws regulating hazardous waste affect coal mining operations by imposing requirements for the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous wastes. Many mining wastes are excluded from the regulatory definition of hazardous wastes, and coal mining operations covered by SMCRA permits are by statute exempted from RCRA permitting. RCRA also allows the EPA to require corrective action at sites where there is a release of hazardous substances.  In addition, each state has its own laws regarding the proper management and disposal of waste material.  While these laws impose ongoing compliance obligations, such costs are not believed to have a material impact on our operations.

In June 2010, the EPA released a proposed rule to regulate the disposal of certain coal combustion by-products (“CCB”).  The proposed rule set forth two very different options for regulating CCB under RCRA.  The first option called for regulation of CCB as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C, which creates a comprehensive program of federally enforceable requirements for waste management and disposal.  The second option utilized Subtitle D, which would give the EPA authority to set performance standards for waste management facilities and would be enforced primarily through citizen suits.  The proposal leaves intact the Bevill exemption for beneficial uses of CCB.  In April 2012, several environmental organizations filed suit against the EPA to compel the EPA to take action on the proposed rule.  Several companies and industry groups intervened.  A consent decree was entered on January 29, 2014.
 
The EPA finalized the CCB rule on December 19, 2014, setting nationwide solid, nonhazardous waste standards for CCB disposal.  On April 17, 2015, the EPA finalized regulations under the solid waste provisions (“Subtitle D”) of RCRA and not the hazardous waste provisions (“Subtitle C”) which became effective on October 19, 2015.  EPA affirms in the preamble to the final rule that “this rule does not apply to CCR placed in active or abandoned underground or surface mines.”  Instead, “the U.S. Department of Interior (“DOI”) and EPA will address the management of CCR in mine fills in a separate regulatory action(s).”   While classification of CCB as a hazardous waste would have led to more stringent restrictions and higher costs, this regulation may still increase our customers’ operating costs and potentially reduce their ability to purchase coal.
 
On November 3, 2015, EPA published the final rule Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards (“ELG”), revising the regulations for the Steam Electric Power Generating category which became effective on January 4, 2016. The rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants, based on technology improvements in the steam electric power industry over the last three decades. The combined effect of the CCR and ELG regulations has forced power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and will likely force the closure of certain older existing coal-burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards.  These regulations add costs to the operation of coal-burning power plants on top of other regulations like the 2014 regulations issued under Section 316(b) of the CWA that affects the cooling water intake structures at power plants in order to reduce fish impingement and entrainment.  Individually and collectively, these regulations could, in turn, impact the market for our products. In April 2017, EPA granted petitions for reconsideration and an administrative stay of all future compliance deadlines for the ELG rule.  In August 2017, EPA granted petitions for reconsideration of the CCR rule.
 
 Endangered Species Act
 
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and counterpart state legislation protect species threatened with possible extinction. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “USFWS”) works closely with the OSM and state regulatory agencies to ensure that species subject to the ESA are protected from mining-related impacts.  If the USFWS were to designate species indigenous to the areas in which we operate as threatened or endangered, we could be subject to additional regulatory and permitting requirements.
Other Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
 
In addition to the laws and regulations described above, we are subject to regulations regarding underground and above ground storage tanks in which we may store petroleum or other substances.  Some monitoring equipment that we use is subject to licensing under the Federal Atomic Energy Act. Water supply wells located on our properties are subject to federal, state, and local regulation.  In addition, our use of explosives is subject to the Federal Safe Explosives Act.  We are also required to comply with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.  The costs of compliance with these regulations should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Suppliers
 
The main types of goods we purchase are mining equipment and replacement parts, steel-related (including roof control) products, belting products, lubricants, electricity, fuel, and tires.  Although we have many long, well-established relationships with our key suppliers, we do not believe that we are dependent on any of our individual suppliers other than for purchases of electricity.  The supplier base providing mining materials has been relatively consistent in recent years. Purchases of certain underground mining equipment are concentrated with one principle supplier; however, supplier competition continues to develop.

Illinois Basin (ILB)
 
The coal industry underwent a significant transformation in the early 1990s, as greater environmental accountability was established in the electric utility industry.  Through the U.S. Clean Air Act, acceptable baseline levels were established for the release of sulfur dioxide in power plant emissions.  In order to comply with the new law, most utilities switched fuel consumption to low-sulfur coal, thereby stripping the ILB of over 50 million tons of annual coal demand.  This strategy continued until mid-2000 when a shortage of low-sulfur coal drove up prices.  This price increase combined with the assurance from the U.S. government that the utility industry would be able to recoup their costs to install scrubbers caused utilities to begin investing in scrubbers on a large scale.  With scrubbers, the ILB has re-opened as a significant fuel source for utilities and has enabled them to burn lower cost high sulfur coal.
 
The ILB consists of coal mining operations covering more than 50,000 square miles in Illinois, Indiana and western Kentucky.  The ILB is centrally located between four of the largest regions that consume coal as fuel for electricity generation (East North Central, West South Central, West North Central and East South Central).  The region also has access to sufficient rail and water transportation routes that service coal-fired power plants in these regions as well as other significant coal consuming regions of the South Atlantic and Middle Atlantic.
 
U. S. Coal Industry
 
The major coal production basins in the U.S. include Central Appalachia (CAPP), Northern Appalachia (NAPP), Illinois Basin (ILB), Powder River Basin (PRB) and the Western Bituminous region (WB). CAPP includes eastern Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia and southern West Virginia. NAPP includes Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia.  The ILB includes Illinois, Indiana and western Kentucky. The PRB is located in northeastern Wyoming and southeastern Montana. The WB includes western Colorado, eastern Utah and southern Wyoming.
 
Coal type varies by basin. Heat value and sulfur content are important quality characteristics and determine the end use for each coal type.
 
Coal in the U.S. is mined through surface and underground mining methods. The primary underground mining techniques are longwall mining and continuous (room-and-pillar) mining.  The geological conditions dictate which technique to use. Our mines use the continuous technique. In continuous mining, rooms are cut into the coal bed leaving a series of pillars, or columns of coal, to help support the mine roof and control the flow of air.  Continuous mining equipment cuts the coal from the mining face.  Generally, openings are driven 20’ wide, and the pillars are rectangular in shape measuring 40’x 40’.  As mining advances, a grid-like pattern of entries and pillars is formed.  Roof bolts are used to secure the roof of the mine.  Battery cars move the coal to the conveyor belt for transport to the surface. The pillars can constitute up to 50% of the total coal in a seam.
 
The United States coal industry is highly competitive, with numerous producers selling into all markets that use coal. We compete against large producers such as Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE: BTU) and Alliance (Nasdaq: ARLP) and small producers.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 

(1) | Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
----+-------------------------------------------

 
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hallador Energy Company (the Company) and its wholly owned subsidiary Sunrise Coal, LLC (Sunrise) and Sunrise’s wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We are engaged in the production of steam coal from mines located in western Indiana. We own a 50% interest in Sunrise Energy, LLC, a private entity engaged in natural gas operations in the same vicinity as the Carlisle Mine. We also own 30.6% equity interest in Savoy Energy, L.P., a private oil and gas company that has operations in Michigan. We have reached an agreement for Savoy to redeem our entire partnership interest for $8 million, which we expect to finalize in mid-March 2018. Our net after commissions paid will be $7.5 million.
  Reclassification
 
To maintain consistency and comparability, certain amounts in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
 
Inventories
 
Coal and supplies inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market. Coal inventory costs include labor, supplies, equipment costs (including depreciation thereto) and overhead.
Advance Royalties
 
Coal leases that require minimum annual or advance payments and are recoverable from future production are generally deferred and charged to expense as the coal is subsequently produced. Advance royalties are included in other assets.
Coal Properties
 
Coal properties are recorded at cost. Interest costs applicable to major asset additions are capitalized during the construction period. Expenditures that extend the useful lives or increase the productivity of the assets are capitalized. The cost of maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful lives or increase the productivity of the assets are expensed as incurred.  Other than land and most mining equipment, coal properties are depreciated using the units-of-production method over the estimated recoverable reserves. Most surface and underground mining equipment is depreciated using estimated useful lives ranging from three to twenty-five years. At the beginning of 2016, we changed from the straight-line method to the units-of-production method in computing the depreciation for continuous miners. This change in estimate reduced our DD&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, by $2.6 million. Due to idle equipment at Carlisle, we stopped depreciating specific underground equipment resulting in a $4.4 million reduction in depreciation for the year ending December 31, 2016.
 
If facts and circumstances suggest that a long-lived asset may be impaired, the carrying value is reviewed for recoverability. If this review indicates that the carrying value of the asset will not be recoverable through estimated undiscounted future net cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life, then an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. See Note 2 for further discussion of impairments.
 
Mine Development
 
Costs of developing new coal mines, including asset retirement obligation assets, or significantly expanding the capacity of existing mines, are capitalized and amortized using the units-of-production method over estimated recoverable reserves.

48
--

Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) - Reclamation
 
At the time they are incurred, legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are reflected at their estimated fair value, with a corresponding charge to mine development. Obligations are typically incurred when we commence development of underground and surface mines and include reclamation of support facilities, refuse areas and slurry ponds.
 
Obligations are reflected at the present value of their future cash flows.  We reflect accretion of the obligations for the period from the date they are incurred through the date they are extinguished. The ARO assets are amortized using the units-of-production method over estimated recoverable (proved and probable) reserves.  We are using discount rates ranging from 5.0% to 10%. Federal and state laws require that mines be reclaimed in accordance with specific standards and approved reclamation plans, as outlined in mining permits.  Activities include reclamation of pit and support acreage at surface mines, sealing portals at underground mines, and reclamation of refuse areas and slurry ponds.
 
We review our ARO at least annually and reflect revisions for permit changes, changes in our estimated reclamation costs and changes in the estimated timing of such costs. In the event we are not able to perform reclamation, we have surety bonds totaling $25 million to cover ARO.
 
The table below (in thousands) reflects the changes to our ARO:

Long-term balance, end of year | $ | 13,506 | | | $ | 13,115 | 

Statement of Cash Flows
 
Cash equivalents include investments with maturities, when purchased, of three months or less.
 
Income Taxes
 
Income taxes are provided based on the liability method of accounting.  The provision for income taxes is based on pretax financial income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future expected tax consequences of temporary differences between income tax and financial reporting and principally relate to differences in the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse.
Net Income per Share
 
Basic net income per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period using the two-class method for our common shares and RSUs which share in the Company’s earnings. Diluted net income per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares include restricted stock units and are included in basic net income per share, using the two-class method.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.  The most significant estimates included in the preparation of the financial statements relate to: (i) fair value estimates relating to business combinations, (ii) deferred income tax accounts, (iii) coal reserves, (iv) depreciation, depletion, and amortization, and (v) estimates used in our impairment analysis.
 
Business Combinations
 
We account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase method requires us to determine the fair value of all acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets and all assumed liabilities. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates and asset lives, among other items.
Revenue Recognition
 
We recognize revenue from coal sales at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer at contracted amounts and amounts are deemed collectible. Some coal supply agreements provide for price adjustments based on variations in quality characteristics of the coal shipped and are recorded in the period of shipment. As discussed below, we do not expect the new revenue recognition standard introduced by ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09) will result in a material change to our pattern of revenue recognition when it becomes effective.
Long-term Contracts
 
As of December 31, 2017, we are committed to supplying our customers a maximum of 26.1 million tons of coal through 2024 of which 13.5 million tons are priced.
 
For 2017, we derived 92% of our coal sales from five customers, each representing at least 10% of our coal sales. 83% of our accounts receivable were from four of these customers, each representing more than 10% of the December 31, 2017 balance.
 
For 2016, we derived 90% of our coal sales from five customers each representing at least 10% of our coal sales. 78% of our accounts receivable were from four of these customers, each representing more than 10% of the December 31, 2016 balance.
 
For 2015, we derived 82% of our coal sales from four customers, each representing at least 10% of our coal sales.
 
We are paid every two to four weeks and do not expect any credit losses.
 
Stock-based Compensation
 
Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award (generally two to four years) using the straight-line method.

New Accounting Standards Issued and Adopted
 
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (ASU 2015-11).  ASU 2015-11 simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory.  It replaces the current lower of cost or market test with the lower of cost or net realizable value test.  Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  The new standard was applied prospectively and effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods.  The adoption of ASU 2015-11 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
New Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Adopted
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02).  ASU 2016-02 increases transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to record right-to-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about lease arrangements.  The new guidance will classify leases as either finance or operating (similar to current standard’s “capital” or “operating” classification), with classification affecting the pattern of income recognition in the statement of income.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently in the process of accumulating all contractual lease arrangements in order to determine the impact on our financial statements and do not believe we have significant amounts of off- balance sheet leases; accordingly, we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-02 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We continue to monitor closely the activities of the FASB and various non-authoritative groups with respect to implementation issues that could affect our evaluation.
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We have adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2018. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.
 
Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of coal through both short-term and long-term contracts with utility companies whereby revenue is currently recognized when risk of loss has passed to the customer. Under the new standard, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. As part of our assessment process, we applied the five-step analysis outlined in the new standard to certain contracts representative of the majority of our coal sales contracts and determined that our pattern of recognition is consistent between the new and existing standards. We also reviewed the expanded disclosure requirements under the new standard and have determined the additional information to be disclosed. In addition, we reviewed our business processes, systems and internal controls over financial reporting to support the new recognition and disclosure requirements under the new standard. Upon adoption of this new standard, we believe that the timing of revenue recognition related to our coal sales will remain consistent with our current practice, but expanded disclosures including presenting revenue for all periods presented and expected revenue by year for performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the date of presentation will be required. We have elected the modified retrospective transition method which allows a cumulative effect adjustment to equity as of the date of adoption. Because we do not anticipate a change in our pattern of revenue recognition, we anticipate that the transition will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Although we don’t consider it material, one source of variable consideration we receive relates to reimbursement from certain customers for expenses incurred for new government impositions adopted, which we may recognize sooner than our current recognition practice.
 
In November 2016, the FASB issued guidance regarding the presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows (ASU 2016-18). This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. We have adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2018.
 

51
--

 

In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to assist in determining if a set of assets and activities being acquired or sold is a business (ASU 2017-01). It also provided a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present, which at a minimum, must be present to be considered a business. This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted in most circumstances. The standard does not have an impact to the Company’s historical recognition of asset acquisitions and business combinations. However, we expect there will be an impact to how the Company accounts for assets acquired in the future.
 
Subsequent Events
 
In January 2018, we declared a dividend of $.04 per share to shareholders of record as of January 31, 2018. The dividend was paid on February 16, 2018.
 
In February 2018, we formed and made an initial investment of $4 million in Hourglass Sands, LLC, a frac sand mining company in the State of Colorado.  We own 100% of the Class A units and will account for Hourglass Sands LLC as a wholly owned subsidiary of Hallador Energy Company.  Class A units are entitled to 100% of profit until our capital investment and interest is returned, then 90% of profits are allocated to Class A Units with the remainder to Class B units.  A Yorktown company associated with one of our directors also invested $4 million for a royalty interest in the sand project.
 
We currently control a permitted sand reserve near Colorado Springs.  We are negotiating to have a third party wash our sand and expect to truck test shipments to customers in the DJ Basin this summer.  We believe we control the only permitted frac sand mine in the State of Colorado.  We do not anticipate Hourglass Sands, LLC to be profitable in 2018, but are excited about its growth potential in future years.
 
We have reached an agreement for Savoy Energy L.P. to redeem our entire partnership interest for $8 million, which we expect to finalize in mid-March 2018. Our net after commissions paid will be $7.5 million.

In December 2016, the deterioration of the North End of the Carlisle Mine (the North End), coupled with lower coal prices led us to determine that the North End could no longer be mined safely and profitably. The sealing of the North End was completed in March 2017. In connection therewith, we identified specific assets totaling $16.6 million ($15.1 million of property and equipment and $1.5 million of advanced royalties) that were written off in 2016.
 
With the Carlisle Mine remaining in hot idle status, we conducted a review of the Carlisle Mine assets as of December 31, 2017, based on estimated future net cash flows, and determined that no further impairment was necessary.
 
The Carlisle Mine assets had an aggregate net carrying value of $110 million at December 31, 2017.  If in future periods we reduce our estimate of the future net cash flows attributable to the Carlisle Mine, it may result in future impairment of such assets and such charges could be significant.
 
Bulldog Reserves
 
In October 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell land associated with the Bulldog Mine for $4.9 million. As part of the transaction, we will hold the rights to repurchase the property for 8 years. Because of the likelihood of exercising the repurchase option, we are accounting for the sale as a financing transaction. The Bulldog Mine assets had an aggregate net carrying value of $15 million at December 31, 2017. Also in October 2017, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (ILDNR) notified us that our mine application, along with modifications, was acceptable. The permit will be issued upon submittal of a fee and bond which are required within 12 months of the notification. We have determined that no impairment is necessary. If estimates inherent in the assessment change, it may result in future impairment of the assets.

(3) | Bank Debt
----+----------

 
On March 18, 2016, we executed an amendment to our credit agreement with PNC, as administrative agent for our lenders, for the primary purpose of increasing liquidity and maintaining compliance through the maturity of the agreement in August 2019.  The revolver was reduced from $250 million to $200 million, and the $175 million term loan remained the same. Our debt at December 31, 2017, was $202 million (term-$71 million, revolver-$131 million). As of December 31, 2017, we had additional borrowing capacity of $69 million and total liquidity of $85 million.
 
Bank fees and other costs incurred in connection with the initial facility and the amendment were $9.1 million, which were deferred and are being amortized over five years. The credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of Sunrise’s assets, and we are the guarantor.
 
The amended credit facility increased the Maximum Leverage Ratio (Sunrise total funded debt/ trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA) to those listed below:
 

Fiscal Periods Ending | Ratio | 
-------------------------------------+-------+-----
December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 | | 4.25 | X
June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2018 | | 4.00 | X
December 31, 2018 | | 3.75 | X
March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 | | 3.50 | X

 
The amended credit facility also requires a Debt Service Coverage Ratio minimum of 1.25X through the maturity of the credit facility. The amendment defines the Debt Service Coverage Ratio as trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA/annual debt service.
 
At December 31, 2017, our Leverage Ratio was 2.40 and our Debt Service Coverage Ratio was 1.90. Therefore, we were in compliance with these two debt covenant ratios.
 
The interest rate on the facility ranges from LIBOR plus 2.25% to LIBOR plus 4%, depending on our leverage ratio. We entered into swap agreements to fix the LIBOR component of the interest rate to achieve an effective fixed rate of ~5% on the original term loan balance and on $100 million of the revolver. The revolver swap notional value steps down 10% each quarter which commenced on March 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, these two interest rate swaps had an estimated net fair value of $.5 million included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Notional values of the two interest rate swaps were $96 million and $30 million as of December 31, 2017.
 
At December 31, 2017, we were paying LIBOR at 1.57% plus 3% for a total interest rate of 4.57%.

(4) | Income Taxes (in thousands)
----+----------------------------

 
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, (1) bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property; (2) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate; (3) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax; (4) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (5) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction; (6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; and (7) limitations on net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017, to 80 percent of taxable income.
 
The SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act. As we are not subject to either the international changes of the Tax Act or other applicable provisions, we believe that the income tax effects of the Tax Act applicable to our accounting under ASC 740 is substantially complete for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additional information that may affect the accounting under ASC 740 would include further clarification and guidance on how the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities will implement the Tax Act. We do not believe potential adjustments in future periods would materially impact the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
 
The Tax Act reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Because ASC 740-10-25-47 requires the effect of a change in tax laws or rates to be recognized as of the date of enactment, we are required to adjust deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 22, 2017. Accordingly, we have recorded a decrease related to our net deferred tax liability of $16.4 million, with a corresponding net adjustment to deferred income tax benefit of $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between book and tax basis are comprised of the following at December 31: 
 

 | 2017 | | | 2016 | 
-----------------------------------------+------+---------+---+------+--
Long-term deferred tax assets: | | | | | | | 
Stock-based compensation | $ | 251 | | | $ | 512 | 
Investment in Savoy | | 781 | | | | 1,031 |

Alternative minimum tax credit | | 2,705 | | | | 4,221 | 
Other | | 943 | | | | 564 | 
Total long-term deferred tax assets | | 18,306 | | | | 21,236 | 
Long-term deferred tax liabilities: | | | | | | | 
Coal properties | | (47,034 | ) | | | (50,439 | )
Oil and gas properties | | - | | | | (15,971 | )
Total long-term deferred tax liabilities | | (47,034 | ) | | | (66,410 | )
Net deferred tax liability | $ | (28,728 | ) | | $ | (45,174 | )

 
Our effective tax rate (ETR) for 2017 was (138)% compared to (48)% for 2016 and 27% for 2015. The negative ETR in 2017 is due primarily to the effects of the Tax Act adjustment to our deferred taxes and prior year tax return reconciliation which were all recorded discretely for the year ended December 31, 2017. The negative ETR in 2016 is due to the combination of the reduction in book income before taxes because of the asset impairment expense, permanent tax benefits of statutory depletion in excess of tax basis in the mining properties, the captive insurance company effects, and stock based compensation expense. The tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are not predictive of future tax rates due to the deferred income tax benefit of the Tax Act. The tax rate would have been 9% without the effects of the deferred income tax benefit of the Tax Act and the prior year tax return reconciliation. Historically, our actual effective tax rates have been lower than the statutory effective rate primarily due to the benefit received from statutory depletion allowances. The deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in income before income taxes.
 
We have analyzed our filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions, to determine whether the positions will be more likely than not be sustained by the applicable tax authority.  Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are not recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year.  We identified our federal tax return and our Indiana state tax return as “major” tax jurisdictions.  We believe that our income tax filing positions and deduction will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our consolidated financial position. While not material, we record any penalties and interest as SG&A. Tax returns filed with the IRS for the years 2014 through 2016 along with tax returns filed with numerous state entities remain subject to examination.

(5) | Stock Compensation Plans
----+-------------------------

Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)
 
On May 16, 2017, our Compensation Committee authorized the issuance and immediate vesting of 495,000 RSUs to our Chairman, President, and CFO. These shares were valued at $3.8 million, based on the May 16, 2017, closing stock price of $7.74.
 
By shareholder approval on May 25, 2017, our 2008 Restricted Stock Unit Plan (RSU Plan) was amended and restated to add 1,000,000 shares and extend its term through May 25, 2027.
 
On June 6, 2017, our Compensation Committee approved a Four-Year Compensation Plan for our Chairman, President, and CFO that granted them 645,000 RSUs. Beginning December 16, 2018, these RSUs will vest/lapse 25% annually through December 16, 2021, or earlier based on the terms of the RSU Plan and the applicable award agreements.   The closing stock price on the date of grant was $8.23.

The outstanding RSUs have a value of $6.2 million based on the March 9, 2018, closing stock price of $6.53.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 stock based compensation was $7.3 million, $2.5 million, and $3.1 million, respectively. For 2018, based on existing RSUs outstanding, stock-based compensation expense is estimated to be $2.0 million.
 
Stock Options
 
We have no stock options outstanding.
 
Stock Bonus Plan
 
Our stock bonus plan was authorized in late 2009 with 250,000 shares. Currently, we have 86,383 shares available for future issuance.
 

(6) | Employee Benefits
----+------------------

 
We have no defined benefit pension plans or post-retirement benefit plans. We offer our employees a 401(k) Plan, where we match 100% of the first 4% that an employee contributes and a discretionary Deferred Bonus Plan for certain key employees.  We also offer health benefits to all employees and their families.  We have 2,289 participants in our employee health plan. The plan does not cover dental, vision, short-term or long-term disability. These coverages are available on a voluntary basis.  We bear some of the risk of our employee health plans. Our health claims are capped at $200,000 per person with a maximum annual exposure of $14.4 million, not including premiums.
 
Our employee benefit expenses for the years ended December 31 are below (in thousands):
 

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2015
------------------------------------+------+--------+------+---+--------+-----
Health benefits, including premiums | $ | 13,311 | | $ | 12,672 | | $ | 13,400
401(k) matching | | 1,892 | | | 1,458 | | | 2,267 
Deferred bonus plan | | 677 | | | 588 | | | 445 
Total | $ | 15,880 | | $ | 14,718 | | $ | 16,112

 
Of the amounts in the above table, $15.5 million, $13.8 million, and $15.2 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively are recorded in operating costs and expenses with the remainder in SG&A.
 
Our mine employees are also covered by workers’ compensation and such costs for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $2.8 million, $2.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively, of which $2.5 million, $2.3 million, and $4.6 million, respectively are recorded in operating costs and expenses with the remainder in SG&A. Workers’ compensation is a no-fault system by which individuals who sustain work related injuries or occupational diseases are compensated. Benefits and coverage are mandated by each state which includes disability ratings, medical claims, rehabilitation services, and death and survivor benefits.  Our operations are protected from these perils through insurance policies.  Our maximum annual exposure is limited to $1 million per occurrence with a $4 million aggregate deductible.  Based on discussions and representations from our insurance carrier, we believe that our reserve for our workers’ compensation benefits is adequate.  We have a safety conscious workforce, and based on our experience modifier, our claims are averaging 27% below that of our peers in underground coal mining in the state of Indiana.

(10) | Fair Value Measurements
-----+------------------------

 
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:
 
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  Our marketable securities are Level 1 instruments.
 
Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  We have no Level 2 instruments.
 
Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). Our Level 3 instruments are comprised of interest rate swaps. The fair values of our swaps were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest-rate yield curves.  Although we utilize third party broker quotes to assess the reasonableness of our prices and valuation, we do not have sufficient corroborating market evidence to support classifying these assets and liabilities as Level 2.
 
The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at fair value at December 31, 2017 and 2016 by respective level of the fair value hierarchy:

(11) | Equity Method Investments
-----+--------------------------

 
We own a 50% interest in Sunrise Energy, LLC, which owns gas reserves and gathering equipment with plans to develop and operate such reserves. Sunrise Energy also plans to develop and explore for oil, gas and coal-bed methane gas reserves on or near our underground coal reserves. We received distributions totaling $175,000 and $375,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
We own a 30.6% interest in Savoy Energy, L.P., a private company engaged in the oil and gas business primarily in the state of Michigan.
 
On November 3, 2016, Lubar Equity Fund, LLC acquired a 25% interest in Savoy for $9.5 million in cash. Accordingly, our ownership interest was reduced from 40.8% to 30.6%. At closing, Savoy made a cash distribution of $4.4 million of which our share was $1.8 million and per our credit agreement was applied to our bank debt. Mr. Lubar, one of our directors, is affiliated with Lubar Equity Fund, LLC.
 
We did not receive any distributions in 2017 and received two distributions in 2016 totaling $3.6 million from Savoy. Both distributions were applied to our bank debt as required under our agreement.
 
Savoy also recorded impairments of $1.0 million, $2.0 million, and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
 
We have reached an agreement for Savoy to redeem our entire partnership interest for $8 million, which we expect to finalize in mid-March 2018. Our net after commissions paid will be $7.5 million.

(12) | Freelandville and Log Creek Purchases
-----+--------------------------------------

 
On March 22, 2016, we completed the purchase of the Freelandville coal reserves, advanced royalties, and coal sales agreement for $18.25 million from Triad Mining LLC. These reserves totaled 14.2 million tons of fee and leased coal and will be mined from our Oaktown 1 portal. This purchase allowed us access to another 1.6 million tons of our own leased reserves that were previously inaccessible. The purchased coal sales agreement totaled 1,435,000 tons and was fulfilled in 2017. The purchase price allocation for the acquisition was as follows (in thousands):
 

Purchased coal contract | $ | 6,407
