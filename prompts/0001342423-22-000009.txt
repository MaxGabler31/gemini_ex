Item 1. Business
Limoneira Company, a Delaware corporation, is the successor to several businesses with operations in California since 1893. Our business and operations are described below. For detailed financial information with respect to our business and our operations, see our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 in this Annual Report. In addition, general information concerning our Company can be found on our website at www.limoneira.com. All of our filings with the SEC, including but not limited to, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments thereto, are available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The contents of our website referred to above are not incorporated into this report. Further, any references to our website are intended to be interactive textual references only.
Overview
We are primarily an agribusiness company founded and based in Santa Paula, California, committed to responsibly using and managing our approximately 15,400 acres of land, water resources and other assets to maximize long-term stockholder value. Our current operations consist of fruit production, sales and marketing, rental operations, real estate and capital investment activities.
We are one of California’s oldest citrus growers. According to Sunkist Growers, Inc. (“Sunkist”), we are one of the largest growers of lemons in the United States and, according to the California Avocado Commission, one of the largest growers of avocados in the United States. In addition to growing lemons and avocados, we grow oranges and a variety of specialty citrus and other crops. We have agricultural plantings throughout Ventura, Tulare, San Luis Obispo and San Bernardino Counties in California, Yuma County in Arizona, La Serena, Chile and Jujuy, Argentina, which collectively consist of approximately 6,100 acres of lemons, 800 acres of avocados, 1,000 acres of oranges and 900 acres of specialty citrus and other crops. We also operate our own packinghouses in Santa Paula and Oxnard, California and Yuma, Arizona, where we process, pack and sell lemons that we grow, as well as lemons grown by others. We have a 47% interest in Rosales S.A. (“Rosales”), a citrus packing, marketing and sales business, a 90% interest in Fruticola Pan de Azucar S.A. (“PDA”), a lemon and orange orchard and 100% interest in Agricola San Pablo SpA. ("San Pablo"), a lemon and orange orchard, all of which are located near La Serena, Chile. We have a 51% interest in a joint venture, Trapani Fresh Consorcio de Cooperacion ("Trapani Fresh"), a lemon orchard in Argentina.
Our water resources include water rights, usage rights and pumping rights to the water in aquifers under, and canals that run through, the land we own. Water for our farming operations is sourced from the existing water resources associated with our land, which includes rights to water in the adjudicated Santa Paula Basin (aquifer) and the un-adjudicated Fillmore and Paso Robles Basins (aquifers). We use ground water from the San Joaquin Valley Basin and water from local water and irrigation districts in Tulare County, which is in California’s San Joaquin Valley. We also use ground water from the Cadiz Valley Basin in California’s San Bernardino County and surface water in Arizona from the Colorado River through the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District (“YMIDD”). We use ground water provided by wells and surface water for our PDA and San Pablo farming operations in Chile and our Trapani Fresh farming operations in Argentina.
For more than 100 years, we have been making strategic investments in California agriculture and real estate. We currently have an interest in three real estate development projects in California. These projects include multi-family housing and single-family homes of approximately 900 units in various stages of planning and development.
Fiscal Year 2021 Highlights and Recent Developments
We are equal partners in a joint venture with The Lewis Group of Companies (“Lewis”) for the residential development of our East Area I real estate development project. To consummate the transaction, we formed Limoneira Lewis Community Builders, LLC ("LLCB") as the development entity. The first phase of the project broke ground to commence mass grading in November 2017. LLCB has closed on lot sales representing 586 units from inception through October 31, 2021, including 232 units in fiscal year 2021. For further information see Note 7 – Real Estate Development of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
In December 2020, we received $5.0 million of federal income tax refunds related to the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") and received an additional $0.9 million of California state refunds in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021.
In June 2021, we entered into an agreement, effective March 1, 2021, to sell and license certain assets of Trapani Fresh to our 49% partner in the joint venture, FGF Trapani ("FGF"). These assets consist of packing supplies and certain intangible assets related to 
 5


the packing, marketing, and selling business of Trapani Fresh. The total consideration to be received is approximately $3.9 million over an 8-year term in 16 equal installments. There was no material gain or loss recognized on the transaction. In August 2021, we entered into several additional agreements whereby the additional 25% interest in Finca Santa Clara ("Santa Clara") was transferred into the trust resulting in the trust now holding a 100% interest in Santa Clara. Trapani Fresh owns and operates the 1,200-acre Santa Clara ranch and now sells the lemons it grows to FGF, who packs, markets, and sells the fruit to its customers. As a result of this transaction, Trapani Fresh now recognizes lemon revenues at the market price, less packinghouse charges to harvest, pack and market the fruit.
In June 2021, we entered into a Master Loan Agreement (the “MLA”) with Farm Credit West, PCA (the “Lender”) dated June 1, 2021, together with a revolving credit facility supplement (the “Revolving Credit Supplement”), a non-revolving credit facility supplement (the “Non-Revolving Credit Supplement,” and together with the Revolving Credit Supplement, the “Supplements”) and an agreement to convert to fixed interest rate ("Fixed Interest Rate Agreement"). The MLA governs the terms of the Supplements. The MLA amends and restates the previous Master Loan Agreement between our Company and the Lender, dated June 19, 2017 and extends the principal repayment to July 1, 2026. 
In July 2021, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent to sell approximately 25 acres of our East Area II property in five staged purchases to an investment company for the purpose of constructing a medical campus consisting of medical office buildings and an acute care hospital. Completion of the transaction is subject to the execution of a purchase and sale agreement and resolution of certain contingencies. 
In August 2021, we entered into an equipment finance agreement (the "FCW term loan") with the Lender in the amount of $2.5 million and used the proceeds to pay off the Wells Fargo term loan. The FCW term loan has a fixed interest rate of 3.19% and is payable in monthly installments through September 2026. 
In September 2021, the Board of Directors of our Company approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $10.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock through September 2022. No shares have been repurchased under this program.
On December 14, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.075 per common share payable on January 14, 2022, in the aggregate amount of $1.3 million to stockholders of record as of December 27, 2021. 
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the industries and markets in which we conduct business. In particular, the United States lemon market has seen a significant decline in volume, with lemon demand falling since widespread shelter in place orders were issued in mid-March 2020, resulting in a significant market oversupply. The export market for fresh product has also significantly declined due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacts. As of October 31, 2021, the demand within both markets is recovering but has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.
The decline in demand for our products beginning the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, which we believe was due to the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively impacted our sales and profitability for the last three quarters of fiscal year 2020 and all of fiscal year 2021. We also expect material adverse impacts on our sales and profitability in future periods. The duration of these trends and the magnitude of such impacts cannot be estimated at this time, as they are influenced by a number of factors, many of which are outside management’s control, including, but not limited, to those presented in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report. Notwithstanding the adverse impacts and subject to unforeseen changes that may arise as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we currently expect improvement in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021.
Given the economic uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years, we have taken actions to improve our current liquidity position, including temporarily postponing capital expenditures, selling equity securities to increase cash, reducing operating costs, and substantially reducing discretionary spending.
Although we are considered an essential business, there is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of our business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as its impact on the U.S. economy, the ongoing business operations of our customers and our results of operations and financial condition. Our management team is actively monitoring the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and customers or as required by federal, state, or local authorities, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for fiscal year 2022 and beyond cannot be fully estimated at this point. The following discussions are subject to the future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ongoing business operations.
Business Division Summary 
 6


We have three business divisions: agribusiness, rental operations and real estate development. The agribusiness division is comprised of four reportable operating segments: fresh lemons, lemon packing, avocados and other agribusiness, which includes oranges, specialty citrus and other crops. The agribusiness division includes our core operations of farming, harvesting, lemon packing and lemon sales operations. The rental operations division includes our residential and commercial rentals, leased land operations and organic recycling. The real estate development division includes our investments in real estate development projects. Financial information and discussion of our four reportable segments are contained in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report.
Agribusiness Summary
Farming
Lemons. We market and sell lemons directly to our food service, wholesale and retail customers throughout the United States, Canada, Asia, Australia, Europe and certain other international markets. We are one of the largest lemon growers in the United States with approximately 6,100 acres of lemons planted primarily in Ventura, Tulare and San Bernardino Counties in California and in Yuma County, Arizona. In California, the lemon growing area stretches from the Coachella Valley to Fresno and Monterey Counties, with the majority of the growing areas located in the coastal areas from Ventura County to Monterey County. Ventura County is California’s top lemon producing county. Approximately 27% of our lemons are grown in Ventura County, 22% are grown in Tulare County, 16% are grown in Yuma County, Arizona and 10% are grown in San Bernardino County, California. We also grow approximately 8% of our lemons near La Serena, Chile and 17% of our lemons in Argentina.
There are many varieties of lemons, with the Lisbon, Eureka and Genoa being the predominant varieties marketed on a worldwide basis. Approximately 88% of our lemon plantings are of the Lisbon, Eureka and Genoa varieties and approximately 12% are of other varieties such as sweet Meyer lemons, Proprietary Seedless lemons and Pink Variegated lemons. California-grown lemons are available throughout the year, with peak production periods occurring from January through August. The storage life of fresh lemons generally ranges from one to 18 weeks, depending upon the maturity of the fruit, the growing methods used and the handling conditions in the distribution chain.
Avocados. We are one of the largest avocado growers in the United States with approximately 800 acres of avocados planted throughout Ventura County. In California, the avocado growing area stretches from San Diego County to Monterey County, with the majority of the growing areas located approximately 100 miles north and south of Los Angeles County.
California-grown avocados have peak production periods occurring between February and July. Other avocado varieties have a more limited picking season and typically command a lower price. Because of superior eating quality, the Hass avocado has contributed greatly to the avocado’s growing popularity through its retail, restaurant and other food service uses. Approximately 95% of our avocado plantings are of the Hass variety. The storage life of fresh avocados generally ranges from one to four weeks, depending upon the maturity of the fruit, the growing methods used and the handling conditions in the distribution chain.
We provide a majority of our avocado production to Calavo, a packing and marketing company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol CVGW. Calavo’s customers include many of the largest retail and food service companies in the United States and Canada. Calavo receives fruit from our orchards at its packinghouse located in Santa Paula, California. Calavo’s proximity to our agricultural operations enables us to keep transportation and handling costs to a minimum. Our avocados are packed by Calavo and sold and distributed under its own brands to its customers primarily in the United States and Canada.
Primarily due to differing soil conditions, the care of avocado trees is intensive. The need for more production per acre to compete with foreign sources of supply has required us to take an important lead in the practice of dense planting (typically four times the number of avocado trees per acre versus traditional avocado plantings) and mulching composition to help trees acclimate under conditions that more closely resemble those found in the tropics, a better climate for avocado growth.
Oranges, Specialty Citrus and Other Crops. We have approximately 1,000 acres of oranges planted primarily in Tulare County, California. In California, the growing area for oranges stretches from Imperial County to Yolo County. California-grown Navel oranges are available from October to June, with peak production periods occurring between January and April. Approximately 96% of our orange plantings are of the Navel variety and approximately 4% are of the Valencia variety. We estimate approximately 70% of our oranges are sold to retail customers and approximately 30% are sold to wholesale customers. We currently have approximately 900 acres of specialty citrus and other crops planted such as Moro blood oranges, Cara Cara oranges, Minneola tangelos, Star Ruby grapefruit, pummelos, pistachios and wine grapes.
We utilize third-party packinghouses to process and pack our oranges and specialty citrus. A portion of our oranges and specialty citrus is marketed and sold under the Sunkist brand by Sunkist and orders are processed by Sunkist-member packinghouses. As an 
 7


agricultural cooperative, Sunkist coordinates the sales and marketing of the oranges and specialty citrus and orders are processed by Sunkist-member packinghouses for direct shipment to customers.
We currently market our other crops, such as pistachios and wine grapes, utilizing processors that are not members of agricultural cooperatives. Our pistachios are harvested and sold to a roaster, packager and marketer of nuts, and our wine grapes are sold to various wine producers.

The Limoneira/Olivelands Ranch is the original site of our Company. Our headquarters, lemon packing operations and storage facilities are located on this property.
The Teague McKevett Ranch is the site of our real estate development project known as East Area I and described below under the “Real Estate Development Summary” heading.
The other agribusiness land in the table above includes corporate and lemon packing facilities, land leased to other agricultural businesses, rental units, roads, creeks, hillsides and other open land.
Our orchards can maintain production for many years. For financial reporting purposes, we depreciate our orchards from 20 to 40 years depending on the fruit variety with the majority of our orchards depreciated over 20 to 30 years. We regularly evaluate our orchards’ production and growing costs and based on these and other factors, we may decide to redevelop certain orchards. In addition, we may acquire agricultural property with existing productive orchards or without productive orchards, which would require new orchard plantings. The fruit varieties that we grow are typically non-producing for approximately the first four years after planting. Orchards may continue producing fruit longer than their depreciable lives. The following table presents the number of acres planted by fruit variety and approximate age of our orchards:

Lemon Packing and Sales
We are the oldest continuous lemon packing operation in North America. We pack and sell lemons grown by us as well as lemons grown by others, the operations of which are included in our financial statements under the lemon packing segment. Lemons delivered to our packinghouses in Santa Paula and Oxnard, California and Yuma, Arizona are sized, graded, cooled, ripened and packed for delivery to customers. Our ability to accurately estimate the size, grade and timing of the delivery of the annual lemon crop has a substantial impact on both our costs and the sales price we receive for the fruit.
A significant portion of the costs related to our lemon packing operation is fixed. Our strategy for growing the profitability of our lemon packing operations calls for optimizing the percentage of a crop that goes to the fresh market, or fresh utilization, and procuring a larger percentage of the California and Arizona lemon crop.
We invest considerable time and research into refining and improving our lemon packing through innovation and are continuously searching for new techniques to refine how premium lemons are delivered to our consumers. In fiscal year 2016, our updated lemon packing facility became operational, which doubled our lemon packing capacity and increased the efficiency and financial results of these operations. Additionally, we purchased a packing house and related land ("Oxnard Lemon") in fiscal year 2018.
Rental Operations Summary
Our rental operations include our residential and commercial rentals, leased land operations and organic recycling. 
We own and maintain 256 residential housing units located in Ventura and Tulare Counties in California that we lease to employees, former employees and non-employees. We also own several commercial office buildings and as with our residential housing units, these properties generate reliable cash flows that we use to partially fund the operating costs of our business. As of October 31, 2021, we lease approximately 500 acres of our land to third-party agricultural tenants who grow a variety of row crops. Our leased land business provides us with a profitable method to diversify the use of our land. We also partner with one of our tenants and have an organic recycling facility on our land in Ventura County. 
Real Estate Development Summary
We invest in real estate development projects and recognize that long-term strategies are required for successful real estate development activities. Our goal is to redeploy real estate earnings and cash flow into the expansion of our agribusiness and other income producing real estate. For real estate development projects and joint ventures, it is not unusual for the timing and amounts of revenues and costs, partner contributions and distributions, project loans, other financing assumptions and project cash flows to be impacted by government approvals, project revenue and cost estimates and assumptions, economic conditions, financing sources and product demand as well as other factors. Such factors could affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 
For more than 100 years, we have been making strategic real estate investments in California agricultural and developable real estate. Our current real estate developments include developable land parcels, multi-family housing and single-family homes with approximately 900 units in various stages of planning and development. The following is a summary of each of the strategic agricultural and development real estate investment properties in which we own an interest:
East Area I - Santa Paula, California. East Area I consists of 523 acres that we historically used as agricultural land and is located in Santa Paula approximately ten miles from the City of Ventura and the Pacific Ocean. This property is also known as our Teague McKevett Ranch. East Area I is the location for our master planned community of commercial and residential properties designed to satisfy expected demand in a region that we believe will have few other developments in this coming decade. In 2008, after we completed a process of community planning and environmental review, the citizens of Santa Paula voted to approve the annexation 
 9


of East Area I into Santa Paula. This vote was a requirement of the Save Open-Space and Agricultural Resources (“SOAR”) ordinance that mandates a public vote of the City of Santa Paula for land use conversion.
In November 2015, we entered into a joint venture with Lewis for the residential development of our East Area I real estate development project. To consummate the transaction, we formed LLCB as the development entity, contributed our East Area I property to the joint venture and sold a 50% interest in the joint venture to Lewis for $20.0 million. We expect to receive approximately $100.0 million from LLCB over the estimated 10 to 12-year life of the project, including $20.0 million received on the consummation of LLCB. LLCB's partners will share in capital contributions to fund project costs until loan proceeds and/or revenues are sufficient to fund the project. Since inception, each partner has made funding contributions of $21.4 million, including $2.8 million in fiscal year 2020. The first phase of the project broke ground to commence mass grading in November 2017. Project plans include approximately 1,500 residential units and site improvements substantially completed. Lot sales representing 232 and 144 residential units closed in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 586 residential units have closed from the project's inception to October 31, 2021. 
East Area II - Santa Paula, California. Our design associates and we are in the process of formulating plans for East Area II, a parcel of approximately 30 acres adjacent to East Area I. East Area II is also a part of our Teague McKevett Ranch, which we believe is suited to commercial and/or industrial development along the south side of California Highway 126, a heavily traveled corridor that connects Highway 101 at Ventura on the west with Interstate 5 at Santa Clarita on the east. In July 2021, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent to sell approximately 25 acres of our East Area II property in five staged purchases to an investment company for the purpose of constructing a medical campus consisting of medical office buildings and an acute care hospital. Completion of the transaction is subject to the execution of a purchase and sale agreement and resolution of certain contingencies. 
Santa Maria - Santa Barbara County, California. As of October 31, 2021, we were invested in one entitled development parcel, Sevilla, located in Santa Maria in Santa Barbara County, California. In fiscal year 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our Sevilla property for $2.7 million, which is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022.
Markets and Competitive Strengths
Agribusiness Operations
With agricultural operations dating back to 1893, we are one of California’s oldest citrus growers and one of the largest growers of lemons and avocados in the United States. Consequently, we have developed significant experience with a variety of crops, mainly lemons, avocados and oranges. The following is a brief list of what we believe are our significant competitive strengths with respect to our agribusiness operations:
•Our agricultural properties in Ventura County are located near the Pacific Ocean, which provides an ideal environment for growing lemons, avocados and row crops. Our agricultural properties in Tulare County, which is in the San Joaquin Valley in Central California, and in Yuma, Arizona, are also located in areas that are well-suited for growing citrus crops.
•Historically, a higher percentage of our crops goes to the fresh market, which is commonly referred to as fresh utilization, than that of other growers and packers with which we compete.
•We have contiguous and nearby land resources that permit us to efficiently use our agricultural land and resources.
•In all but one of our properties, we are not dependent on State or Federal water projects to support our agribusiness or real estate development operations.
•We own approximately 94% of our agricultural land and take a long view on our fruit production practices.
•A significant amount of our agribusiness property was acquired many years ago, which results in a low-cost basis and associated expenses.
•In our fresh lemons and lemon packing segments, our integrated business model with respect to growing, packing, marketing and selling lemons allows us to better serve our customers.
•Our lemon packing operations provide marketing opportunities with other citrus companies and their respective products.
•We have made investments in ground-based solar projects that provide us with tangible and intangible non-revenue generating benefits. The electricity generated by these investments provides us with a significant portion of the electricity required to operate our packinghouse and cold storage facilities located in Santa Paula, California and provides a significant portion of the electricity required to operate four deep-water well pumps at one of our ranches in Tulare County, California. Additionally, these investments support our sustainable agricultural practices, reduce our dependence 
 10


on fossil-based electricity generation and lower our carbon footprint. Moreover, electricity that we generate and do not use is conveyed seamlessly back to the investor-owned utilities operating in these two markets. Finally, over time, we expect that our customers and the end consumers of our fruit will value the investments that we have made in renewable energy as a part of our farming and packing operations, which we believe may help us differentiate our products from similar commodities.
•We have made various other investments in water rights and mutual water companies. We own shares in the following mutual water companies: Farmers Irrigation Co., Canyon Irrigation Co., San Cayetano Mutual Water Co., Middle Road Mutual Water Co. and Pioneer Water Company, Inc. Additionally, we acquired water rights in the adjudicated Santa Paula Basin (aquifer), the YMIDD and in Chile.
Real Estate Development Operations
With respect to our real estate development operations, we believe our competitive advantages are as follows:
•We have entitlements to build approximately 1,500 residential units in our East Area I development.
•We have partnered with an experienced and financially strong land developer for our East Area I residential master plan development.
•Several of our agricultural and real estate investment properties are unique and carry longer-term development potential.
•Our East Area II property has approximately 30 acres of land commercially zoned, which is adjacent to our East Area I property.
Business Strategy
We are an agribusiness and real estate development company that generates annual cash flows to support investments in agricultural and real estate development activities. As our agricultural and real estate development investments are monetized, we intend to seek to expand our agribusiness into new regions and markets and invest in cash-producing residential, commercial and industrial rental assets.
The following describes the key elements of our business strategy.
Agribusiness
With respect to our agribusiness operations, key elements of our strategy are:
•Acquire Additional Lemon Producing Properties.  To the extent attractive opportunities arise and our capital availability permits, we intend to consider the acquisition of additional lemon producing properties. In order to be considered, such properties would need to have certain characteristics to provide acceptable returns, such as an adequate source of water, a warm micro-climate and well-drained soils. We anticipate that the most attractive opportunities to acquire lemon producing properties will be in the San Joaquin Valley near our existing operations in Tulare County, California.
•Expand our Sources of Lemon Supply.  Peak lemon production occurs at different times of the year depending on geographic region. In addition to our lemon production in California and Arizona and lemons we acquire from domestic third-party growers and suppliers, we have expanded our lemon supply sources to international markets such as Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Increases in lemons procured from third-party growers and suppliers and international sources improve our ability to provide our customers with fresh lemons throughout the year.
•Increase the Volume of our Lemon Packing Operations.  We regularly monitor our costs for redundancies and opportunities for cost reductions. In this regard, cost per carton is a function of throughput. We continually seek to acquire additional lemons from third-party growers and suppliers to pack through our plants. Third-party growers and suppliers are only added if we determine their fruit is of good quality and can be cost effective for both the grower and us. Of most importance is the overall fresh utilization rate for our fruit, which is directly related to quality.
•Expand International Production and Marketing of Lemons.  We estimate that we currently have approximately 10% of the fresh lemon market in the United States and a larger share of the United States lemon export market. We intend to explore opportunities to expand our international production and marketing of lemons. We have the ability to supply a wide range of customers and markets and, because we produce high quality lemons, we can export our lemons to international customers, which many of our competitors are unable to supply.
 11


•Construction of an Updated Lemon Packinghouse. Over the years, new machinery and equipment along with upgrades have been added to our original packinghouse and cold storage facilities. This, along with an aggressive and proactive maintenance program, has allowed us to operate an efficient, competitive lemon packing facility. A project to double the capacity and increase the efficiency of our lemon packing facilities became operational in fiscal year 2016. This project has increased fresh lemon processing capacity.
•Opportunistically Expand our Plantings of Avocados, Oranges, Specialty Citrus and Other Crops.  Our plantings of avocados, oranges, specialty citrus and other crops have been profitable and have been pursued to diversify our product line. Agricultural land that we believe is not suitable for lemons is typically planted with oranges, specialty citrus or other crops. While we may expand our avocados, oranges, specialty citrus and other crops, we expect to do so on an opportunistic basis in locations that we believe offer a record of historical profitability.
Other Operations
With respect to our rental operations and real estate development activities, key elements of our strategy include the following:
•Secure Additional Rental and Housing Units.  Our housing, commercial and land rental operations provide us with a consistent, dependable source of cash flow that helps to fund our overall activities. Additionally, we believe our housing rental operation allows us to offer a unique benefit to our employees. 
•Opportunistically Lease Land to Third-Party Crop Farmers.  We regularly monitor the profitability of our fruit-producing acreage to ensure acceptable per acre returns. When we determine that leasing the land to third-party row crop farmers would be more profitable than farming the land, we intend to seek third-party row crop tenants.
•Opportunistically Expand our Income-Producing Commercial and Industrial Rental Assets.  We intend to redeploy our future financial gains to acquire additional income-producing real estate investments and agricultural properties.
•Selectively and Responsibly Develop our Agricultural Land. We recognize that long-term strategies are required for successful real estate development activities. We thus intend to maintain our position as a responsible agricultural landowner and major employer in Ventura County while focusing our real estate development activities on those agricultural land parcels that we believe offer the best opportunities to demonstrate our long-term vision for our community.
Customers
We market and sell our lemons directly to our food service, wholesale and retail customers in the United States, Canada, Asia, Australia, Europe and certain other international markets. We sold lemons to approximately 200 U.S. and international customers during fiscal year 2021. We sell a majority of our avocados to Calavo. Our oranges, specialty citrus and other crops are sold through Sunkist and other third-party packinghouses and our wine grapes are sold to wine producers.
Information about Geographic Areas

During fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had an aggregate of approximately $3.6 million, $14.2 million and $14.7 million, respectively, of total sales in Argentina by Trapani Fresh. The majority of our avocados, oranges and specialty citrus and other crops are sold to packinghouses and processors located in the United States.
Competition
The agribusiness crop markets are intensely competitive, but no single producer has any significant market power over any market segments, as is consistent with the production of most agricultural commodities. Generally, there are a large number of global producers that sell through joint marketing organizations and cooperatives. Fruit is also sold to independent packers, both public and private, who then sell to their own customer base. Customers are typically large retail chains, food service companies, industrial manufacturers and distributors who sell and deliver to smaller customers in local markets throughout the world. In the purest sense, our largest competitors in our agribusiness segments are other citrus and avocado producers in California, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Florida, a number of which are members of cooperatives such as Sunkist or have selling relationships with Calavo similar to that of Limoneira. Our lemons and oranges also compete with other fruits and vegetables for the share of consumer expenditures devoted to fresh fruit and vegetables: apples, pears, melons, pineapples and other tropical fruit. Avocado products compete in the

supermarket with hummus products and other dips and salsas. For our specific crops, the size of the U.S. market is approximately $660 million for lemons, both fresh and juice, approximately $430 million for avocados, and approximately $1.7 billion for oranges, both fresh and juice. Competition in the various agribusiness markets is affected by reliability of supply, product quality, brand recognition and perception, price and the ability to satisfy changing customer preferences through innovative product offerings.
The sale and leasing of residential, commercial and industrial real estate is very competitive, with competition coming from numerous and varied sources throughout California. Our greatest direct competition for each of our current real estate development properties in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties comes from other residential and commercial developments in nearby areas.
Resources and Raw Materials
In our fresh lemons and lemon packing segments, paper is considered a material raw product for our business because most of our products are packed in cardboard cartons for shipment. Paper is readily available and we have numerous suppliers for such material. In our agribusiness division, petroleum-based products such as herbicides and pesticides are considered raw materials and we have numerous suppliers for these products.
Intellectual Property
We have numerous trademarks and brands under which we market and sell our fruits, particularly lemons, domestically and internationally, many of which have been owned for decades. The material brands of Limoneira lemons include, but are not limited to, One World of Citrus®, Santa®, Paula®, Bridal Veil®, Fountain®, Golden Bowl® and Level®. These trademarks are owned by us and registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also acquired certain lemon brands with acquisitions, including Kiva®, Kachina®, Oxnard Lemon, Uno, Sunny, Trapani, Argentinian Beauty, Natural and Trapani Fresh.
Seasonal Nature of Business
As with any agribusiness enterprise, our agribusiness operations are predominantly seasonal in nature. The harvest and sale of our lemons, avocados, oranges and specialty citrus and other crops occurs in all quarters, but is generally more concentrated during our third quarter. Our lemons are generally grown and marketed throughout the year, our avocados are primarily sold from January through August, our oranges are primarily sold from January through June, our specialty citrus is primarily sold from November through April and our specialty crops, such as pistachios and wine grapes, are primarily sold in September and October.
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Our agribusiness and real estate development divisions are subject to a broad range of evolving federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. For example, the growing, packing, storing and distributing of our products is extensively regulated by various federal and state agencies. The California State Department of Food and Agriculture oversees our packing and processing of lemons and conducts tests for fruit quality and packaging standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations that govern the use of pesticides and other potentially hazardous substances and the treatment, handling, storage and disposal of materials and waste and the remediation of contaminated properties. Advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and our operations are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
We seek to comply at all times with all such laws and regulations and to obtain any necessary permits and licenses, and we are not aware of any instances of material non-compliance. We believe our facilities and practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable governmental laws, regulations, permits and licenses. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations for necessary permits and licenses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or obtain any necessary permits and licenses could subject us to civil remedies including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions. These remedies can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
For a discussion of the various risks we face from regulation and compliance matters, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report.

We believe that an environment of diversity, inclusion, and belonging fosters innovation, strengthens our global workforce, and drives our ability to serve customers. Our global presence is strengthened by having a workforce that reflects the diversity of the customers we serve and by maintaining an environment in which such diversity contributes to our mission.
Limoneira is committed to protecting the human rights, safety and dignity of the people who contribute to the success of our business. We are committed to improving the lives of all our stakeholders by helping to provide access to our products and increasing the diversity of our workforce. We also seek to support the welfare of the people who produce, process and harvest the products we sell. We have established several new diversity, inclusion and belonging efforts and programs to better ensure that we are supporting our employees. 
Limoneira’s overall culture emphasizes the health and safety of our employees and the customers we serve. Limoneira has an Illness and Injury Prevention Plan (IIPP), a Safety Guide and conforms to and follows regulations and guidelines set forth by OSHA in all facilities and operations. Where a particular jurisdiction's guidelines, such as Cal OHSA, are different from the OSHA standard, Limoneira adheres to the most extensive guideline. We have excellent results from our safety programs compared to similar companies within our industry. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented, and continue to improve, appropriate safety measures in all our facilities and locations.
We strive to be a great place for our employees to work and live. We offer competitive pay and best-in-class benefits, including a 401k plan with matching contribution opportunities, comprehensive paid healthcare plans, wellness programs, and tuition reimbursement.
We own and maintain 256 residential housing units located in Ventura and Tulare Counties in California. We lease these housing units to employees, former employees and non-employees. Our residential units provide affordable housing to many of our employees, including our agribusiness employees. Employees live close to their work, which reduces traffic and commuting times. This unique employment benefit helps us maintain a dependable, long-term employee base. We partner with some local schools to provide transportation for residents.
