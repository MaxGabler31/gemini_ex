 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 Introduction
  We are in the business of selling and distributing proprietary containers, called Medtainers®, which are made from medical-grade polypropylene resin. Medtainers® can store pharmaceuticals, herbs, teas and other solids or liquids and some models can grind solids and shred herbs. Our original 20-dram version has grinding capacity and one of its models has received child safety certification. We also sell a 40-dram size, which is also air- and water-tight. Our Medtainer® products are described under the caption “Description of Business – Products – The Medtainer®” We are focusing our marketing efforts for this product on drug stores and drug store chains, veterinarians and veterinary distributors and other distributors and end users.
 We also sell and distribute humidity control inserts, lighters, smell-proof bags and other durable goods. They are described under the caption “ Description of Business – Products – New Products” and we are actively developing markets for them.
 We are also in the business of private labeling and branding for purchasers of containers and other products. For more details, see “Description of Business – Printing.”
 Our principal product is the Medtainer®. Its sales accounted for 62% of our revenue in 2018, as compared with 68% in 2017. The most significant components of revenues from our other products and services were humidity control inserts, which we introduced in 2016, and which comprised approximately about 18% of our revenue for 2018, as compared with 19% for 2017, and printing services, which comprised 4% of our revenue in 2018, as compared with 5% in 2017.
 We market directly to businesses through our phone room and to the retail public through internet sales. We also market directly to wholesalers and other businesses who resell our products to other businesses and end users. See “Description of Business – Sales and Distribution.”

We do not market or sell marijuana, but some of our products can be used for marijuana-related purposes. In light of the fact that the possession and use of marijuana have been legalized, subject to varying restrictions, in many states and that several other states are considering such legalization, we believe that our products may be of interest to a large number of users of marijuana in and we advertise our products on our website and elsewhere as suitable for that purpose. However, since we do not seek information from our customers who are end users as to how they intend to utilize our products and have no similar knowledge respecting end users of products sold through our distributors, we are unable to determine the extent of its use in connection with the storage and grinding of marijuana or any other purpose. We believe that marketing these products subjects us to the following risks:
 
The
use of marijuana for medical and recreational use is lawful in many states, but under United States federal law and the laws of
the other states, the possession, use, cultivation, storage, processing and/or transfer of marijuana is illegal. Federal and state
law enforcement authorities have prosecuted persons engaged in these activities. While we do not believe that we engage in any
of these activities, any of these law enforcement authorities might bring an action against us in connection with the engagement
of others in them, including, but not limited, to a claim of aiding and abetting their criminal activities. Such an action would
have a material and adverse effect on our business and operations.
Under United States federal law, it is unlawful to
 sell or offer for sale, to use the mails or any other facility of interstate commerce to transport or to import or export
 drug paraphernalia. The term “drug paraphernalia” includes any equipment, product or material of any kind which
 is primarily intended or designed for use in manufacturing, compounding, converting, concealing, producing, processing,
 preparing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance. One of the
 factors that these authorities may consider in determining whether our products are drug paraphernalia are our national and
 local advertising concerning its use and we have advertised our products as usable for marijuana-related purposes.
 However, we do not believe that our products were designed or are intended for any of these purposes or that our products
 are drug paraphernalia, as defined in federal law, and we are promoting our
 products primarily to be used for other purposes. During the administration of President Barack H. Obama,
 enforcement of such federal law was relaxed, and the administration of President Donald J.
 Trump has indicated that it will not enforce federal marijuana laws against companies that comply with state law. If
 in the future federal authorities were to take a different view, they might
 bring a criminal action against us. Such an action would have a
 material and adverse effect on our business and operations. 

Products
 New Products
 In addition to the Medtainer®, which is described under the caption “Description of Business – Products – The Medtainer®,” we sell and are actively developing markets for the following products, all of which we purchase from their manufacturers and resell:

· | Humidity Control Inserts. We sell inserts that are placed in airtight containers, either to add moisture or to remove moisture. The inserts are of varying size, depending upon the volume of the container, and maintain various levels of relative humidity, depending on the specifications of the insert. These inserts may be used in humidors for cigars and in containers for the storage of herbs, spices and dry food, electronic equipment and documents and photographs, among others. When an insert can no longer release moisture, it must be replaced. A picture of the inserts appears below.

· | Hydroponic Grow Towers. This product is a vertical hydroponic growing system, which contains modular stackable pots for growing plants, designed for urban farms, rooftop gardens, and commercial growing operations. The plants grow without soil, using wood chips, organic coco coir, perlite and others as growing media. Water and nutrients are added manually. Because of its vertical design, the system is space and energy efficient, making it suitable for small spaces, such as balconies, patios and rooftops. It grows plants in a fraction of the time and uses substantially less water compared to conventional gardening. Units are manufactured using various substances, including hardened polyurethane or other plastic. 
· | Smell-Proof (Exit) Bags. These are airtight bags made of flexible polyester, Mylar®, plastic and other substances, with varying means of closure, such as Velcro®, Ziploc® and zippers®. Some use activated carbon to enhance odor removal. Depending on their size, they can be used to store and prevent dissipation of odors from fish, herbs and dirty clothes, among others. 
· | Lighters. These are butane lighters that are sold with and without logos and other markings. We purchase lighters from others and add markings at our facility.

The Medtainer®
 Medtainers® are manufactured from medical-grade polypropylene resin, because we market them for uses that include grinding pills for administration to children and other persons who have difficulty swallowing and to pets. The Medtainer® can store herbs and herbal remedies, medicines, coffee and teas, wines and liquors, foods and other solids and liquids without cross-contamination and grind many substances. Some configurations have a built-in grinder in order that medicines and other solids can be ground into powder or herbs can be shredded. The Medtainer® is air- and water-tight, non-porous and non-leaching. We currently sell the Medtainer® in a 20-dram child-resistant version and our 20-dram original version, a 20-dram non-child-resistant version and a 40-dram non-child-resistant version. We plan to sell the Medtainer® in several other configurations. We sell this product with and without logos and other markings.
 The Medtainer® with a grinder/shredder has three components. The top component is a cap, the middle component is a storage cup with grinding/shredding teeth projecting downward from its bottom and the bottom component is a grinding/shredding cup with teeth projecting upward from its bottom. Material is transferred from the storage cup into the grinding/shredding cup, the storage cup is inserted into the grinding/shredding cup, forming a space in which the two sets of teeth intermesh, and the two cups are then rotated manually such that the material passes between the two sets of teeth and is ground or shredded. The ground or shredded material may then be returned to the storage cup for storage or used or dispensed in another manner. The cap attaches to the grinding/shredding cup such that the storage cup is held between them, forming a compact unit which is air- and water-tight between the cap and the storage cup, as well as between the storage cup and the bottom cup. The pictures on the left and in the center below show exploded views of the non-childproof and childproof configurations of the Medtainer® with a grinder/shredder.
 The picture on the right shows packets containing different amounts of our humidity control inserts which we market under the name MED X 2 Way Humidity Control Pack.



Medtainers® without grinding capacity have only a cap and a storage container.
 In the future, we may sell containers other than the Medtainer® that will give consumers the ability to easily store, carry, grind and consume various solids and liquids.
 Source of Medtainer® Products
 Until June 8, 2018,we purchased our Medtainer® products from Polymation, LLC (“Polymation”), a manufacturer located in Newbury Park, California, under an agreement that we entered into with Polymation on August 13, 2013, under which we had the exclusive worldwide right to purchase, promote, advertise, market, distribute and resell the Medtainer®, with respect to which the owner of Polymation held patents and Polymation held the trademark. On June 8, 2018, we acquired these patents and the trademark, terminated the agreement, licensed Polymation to manufacture Medtainers® solely for purchase by us under the patents and entered into a production contract, dated June 8, 2018, and amended on March 27, 2019, under which Polymation manufactures and we purchase Medtainers® (as so amended, the “Production Contract”). Under the Production Contract, we are initially required to purchase at least 30,000 units per month, with that requirement increasing by 1% on each anniversary of its effective date. The Production Contract sets prices for the products that we purchase, subject to increase because of changes in the local consumer-price index. The Production Contract’s term expires on April 30, 2031, unless we exercise a termination option, under which we may terminate it, upon our payment to Polymation of $400,000, less any amount that its owner agrees that he owes to us or that he owes to us under a final and unappealable judgment, provided that the shares of our common stock issued to him in the transaction in which we acquired the patent and trademark (see “Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property”) may be publicly sold under the exemption from registration afforded by Rule 144 or another exemption from such registration.

Because we now own the patent for the Medtainer®, to the extent that we are able to sell more Medtainers® than we are required to purchase under the Production Contract, we will be able to manufacture them in-house or acquire them from a third party, possibly at prices lower than under the Production Contract, but unless the number of Medtainers® that we are not required to purchase under the Production Contract is substantial, doing so may not be cost-effective. We intend to continue our efforts to sell Medtainers® globally, which, if successful, would increase demand for Medtainers® and could cause increase sales volume so as to cause their production at one or more of our facilities or our acquisition of them from a third party to be cost-effective. We presently have no other suppliers than Polymation for Medtainers®, but may seek them out.
 We purchase our humidity control inserts from Desiccare, Inc. and market these products under our private label “MED X 2 Way Humidity Control Pack” powered by Boost. Sales of these inserts were 4% of total sales in 2018, compared with 19% of total sales in 2017. We believe that the transition to our own MED X branded humidity pack is significant in that many of our Medtainer® products are now being sold with humidity packs inserted into the containers before shipping. This “value added” factor has increased our profitability for this product dramatically.
 There are numerous manufacturers of our other products, none of which is material to our business.
 Sales and Distribution
 Distribution
 We sell approximately 96% of our products to wholesalers and distributors, who resell them to businesses and consumers, with and without custom labeling, and the remainder are sold directly to retail consumers through internet sales. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, we sold approximately 314,000, 558,000 and 1,010,000 total items, respectively. In 2018, we sold approximately 1,020,000 total items. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 217,000 total items in inventory.
 We entered into a Product License and Distribution Agreement, dated April 1, 2014, with IGreen Planet Store, Ltd. (“IGreen”), a Canadian distribution company located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Under this agreement, we have granted to IGreen an exclusive license to market, sell and distribute the Medtainer® in Canada. The agreement had a 5-year term, which has expired. We are negotiating a new agreement with IGreen and are conducting business with IGreen as if the expired agreement were still in effect. We are required to maintain product liability insurance covering the products sold under the agreement. We are in the process of obtaining such insurance. IGreen is not required to purchase a minimum quantity of our products. The agreement is subject to yearly reviews by the parties in respect of price, quantities ordered and other matters. Based upon these reviews, the parties may modify, amend or revoke the agreement.

We have 18 personnel, including our two officers. Nine of them work in our phone room, making sales by telephone and over our website.
 We also have a presence on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and other social media. We believe that social media are important to marketing our products.
 Printing
 Our printing business commenced in 2015. In 2018, we had revenue of approximately $103,758 from printing, compared with approximately $116,000 in 2017. We entered this business because some of our customers desired to have custom labels imprinted on the products that they purchased from us and we found that the cost of doing so through third parties raised the price that we charged to customers for imprinted products to levels that we believed would impede sales. Labelling is performed using specialized printers. We currently have two printers, one of which is capable of printing on nonporous plastic. Currently, we devote about 2,000 square feet to this business. We are seeking additional printing business from companies that require labelling on their own products.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 On April 26, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 16, 2018, by and us and the owner of Polymation, which was amended on June 8, 2018 (as amended, the “APA”), whereunder, among other things, we agreed to acquire from him and certain entities (including Polymation) that he controlled, and he agreed to sell, assign and transfer to us, and to cause these entities to sell assign and transfer to us, certain patents and patent applications relating to the Medtainer®, a trademark of the name Medtainer® and an internet domain in consideration of our delivery to him of 2,631,252 shares of our common stock. The closing under the APA occurred on June 8, 2018. 
 As a consequence of our acquisition of these patents and the trademark, we are able to defend the Medtainer® against infringement and counterfeiting more effectively than before the acquisition. We believe that such acquisition has enabled us to invite larger companies to explore the possibility of strategic partnerships, expand into other container markets and diversify into associated and\or new markets.
 We employ various methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employees and consultants, to protect our trade secrets and know-how. We may license the Medtainer® patents and trademark to, and future, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary rights to and from, third parties. As we develop our own products, we may rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, unpatented know-how, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our proprietary rights. We cannot presently ascertain the extent to which other intellectual property that we may develop or license will be important to us.

Competition
 While the Medtainer® is a patented product, similar products are being sold. We have not determined whether all of these products conflict with the Medtainer® patents, but when we determine that a conflict trusts, we take measures to enforce these patents. We have not determined to what extent these products have affected our business. We face competition of varying degrees of intensity in the sale of our products and compete with and seek to distinguish ourselves from multiple companies principally on the basis of the uniqueness and quality of our products, price, service, quality, product characteristics and timely delivery of orders. We also stress the maintenance of strong relationships with our direct customers., our distributors and, where possible, their customers, as well as ours. Our Medtainer® products compete with metal, glass, paper and other packaging materials as well as plastic and resin packaging materials made through different manufacturing processes. Most of our existing and potential competitors have greater brand name recognition and their products may enjoy greater initial market acceptance among our potential customers. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, distribution, service and other resources than we have and may also be better able to adapt quickly to customers’ changing demands and changes in technology, to enhance existing products, to develop and introduce new products and new production technologies and to respond timely changing market conditions and customer demands. If we are not able to compete successfully in the face of our competitors’ advantages, our ability to gain market share or market acceptance for the products that we sell could be limited, our revenues and our profit margins could suffer, and we may never become profitable.
 Except for the market for containers such as the Medtainer®, in which believe we are a significant competitor, we are an insignificant factor in the highly fragmented markets for our other products and, although we intend to improve our position in these markets, it is unlikely that we will become significant for the foreseeable future.
Regulation
 The Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) regulates the material content of our Medtainer® products, including the medical-grade polypropylene resin used in their manufacture, pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) regulates certain aspects of our products pursuant to various federal laws, including the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. The FDA and the CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall these products and may also impose fines or penalties on the manufacturer. Similar laws exist in some states, cities and other countries in which we sell or intend to sell our products. In addition, certain state laws restrict the sale of packaging with certain levels of heavy metals and impose fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although FDA-approved resins and pigments are used in our products that directly contact food and drugs and we believe our products are in material compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements (although we are not required to submit them to either the FDA or the CPSC for review), we are remain subject to the risk that our products could be found not to be in compliance with these and/or other requirements. A recall of any of our products or any fines and penalties imposed in connection with noncompliance could have a materially adverse effect on us.
 We are not required to submit the Medtainer® or any of our other products for review by either agency.
 Employees

We have, in addition to our 2 executive officers, 9 sales personnel, 3 administrative personnel and 4 print technicians and warehouse personnel.
