OVERVIEW
AMC Networks is a global entertainment company known for its popular and award-winning content. We distribute our content to audiences globally on an ever-expanding array of distribution platforms, including: linear networks, subscription streaming services, and social media platforms, as well as through content licensing arrangements. We have an extensive library of television and film properties that we own and control, including several storied franchises that are well-known to a global audience.
We have operated in the entertainment industry for more than 40 years, and over that time we have created targeted and focused video entertainment products that we own and operate and that are powered by distinguished brands, including AMC, AMC+, BBC AMERICA (which we operate through a joint venture with BBC Studios), IFC, SundanceTV, WE tv, Acorn TV, Shudder, Sundance Now, ALLBLK, and IFC Films. Our distinctive, critically-acclaimed content spans multiple genres, including drama, documentary, comedy, reality, anthology, feature film and short form. Our content and our brands are well known and well regarded by our key constituents — our viewers and subscribers as well as distributors and advertisers. Our network, streaming and show brands have developed strong, dedicated followings within their respective targeted demographics, increasing their value to distributors and advertisers. Through our AMC Studios in-house studio, production and distribution operation, we own and control a significant portion of the original scripted series that we deliver to viewers on our linear and streaming platforms. Our ability to produce and own high quality content has provided us with the opportunity to distribute our owned content on leading third-party platforms. Our owned content as well as the content that we license is distributed domestically and internationally across linear networks, digital streaming services, home video and syndication.
In the United States ("U.S."), our programming networks are AMC, BBC AMERICA, IFC, SundanceTV and WE tv. Our deep and established presence in the industry and the recognition we have received for our content and brands through industry awards, critical acclaim and other honors lend us a high degree of credibility with content creators and producers, providing us with strong relationships with top creative talent and demand for our owned programming for distribution on third-party platforms. Our networks are distributed primarily through traditional and virtual multi-channel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") and are available on every major U.S. distribution platform. Our programming strategy is to target audiences with high-quality, compelling stories and powerful brands, with shows like The Walking Dead, Killing Eve, Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, which resonate with critics and fans alike. 
For the last several years, an increasing area of focus has been to establish a portfolio of targeted subscription streaming services with strong brands that serve passionate fans with content depth, curation and community. Today, we are the global leader in targeted streaming. Our services include our premium subscription streaming bundle called AMC+. Launched in 2020, AMC+ includes commercial-free access to original programming from across our entertainment networks; library content including The Walking Dead, Fear the Walking Dead, The Walking Dead: World Beyond and Mad Men; and access to a number of our targeted streaming services. AMC+ is available to customers through our direct to consumer (“DTC”) app, as well as through MVPDs and virtual MVPDs, and digital streaming platforms such as Amazon Prime Channels, Apple TV Channels and The Roku Channel. AMC+ is currently available internationally in Canada and Australia, with additional expansion into overseas markets planned for 2022. 
Our targeted streaming offerings also include: 
•Acorn TV, featuring world-class mysteries and drama from Britain and beyond; 
•Shudder, for fans of horror and suspense; 
•Sundance Now, featuring prestige drama and true crime; 
•ALLBLK, focused on Black content from Black storytellers; and 
•HIDIVE, featuring anime-focused content.
The content on these platforms is a mix of licensed and owned originals, a category that continues to expand as we increasingly invest in producing original programming, which is contributing to strong growth and a stable user base. Our various services are distributed in several key markets internationally, including Canada, the UK, parts of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Latin America, and we see a large opportunity for continued expansion of our services globally.
In December 2021, we acquired Sentai Holdings, LLC (“Sentai”), a leading global supplier of anime content and merchandise, with brands including the anime-focused HIDIVE subscription streaming service. With strong industry relationships and access to key content creators in Japan, Sentai distributes and curates one of the anime industry’s most diverse libraries of top trending and classic titles.
Internationally, we deliver programming that reaches subscribers in more than 125 countries and territories around the world. The international division of the Company, AMC Networks International ("AMCNI"), consists of our premier AMC global brand as well as a portfolio of popular, locally recognized brands delivering programming in a wide range of genres. 
AMC Networks also operates IFC Films, a film distribution business that distributes independent narrative and documentary films under the IFC Films label as well as the IFC Midnight distribution label. IFC Films is known for attracting high-profile talent and distributing films that regularly garner critical acclaim and industry honors, including numerous Academy Award, Golden Globe, and Cannes Film Festival-award winning titles, and has been behind some of the most culturally impactful and successful independent film and documentary releases of all time. IFC Films also operates IFC Films Unlimited, a subscription streaming service comprised of a broad range of theatrically-released and award winning titles from its distribution labels.
Strategy
Our strategy is to maintain and improve our position as a leading entertainment company by creating and showcasing content that is high-quality, brand defining and compelling to watch, and by owning and operating some of the most popular and award-winning brands in entertainment that create engagement with audiences globally across multiple distribution platforms. Our strategic areas of focus are:
Continued Development of High-Quality Original Content. We intend to continue developing strong original content across our linear networks and streaming services to further enhance our brands, strengthen our relationships with our viewers, subscribers, distributors and advertisers, and to build viewership and attract and retain subscribers for our streaming services. We believe that our continued investment in original programming will support optimization of affiliate and streaming subscription, content licensing and advertising revenue. 
Increased Ownership and Control of Content and Valuable IP. AMC Networks’ wholly-owned or majority-controlled library includes more than 6,000 episodes and 1,300 films, as well as more than 20,000 episodes of highly localized unscripted lifestyle content from our AMC Networks International business. In addition, we have storied titles and brands known to a global audience, such as The Walking Dead, the Anne Rice catalog and the Agatha Christie library.
We are very focused on increasing production of our proprietary content and leveraging our library of titles in order to enrich the content mix on our targeted streaming platforms. As our current content licensing deals with third parties expire, hundreds of hours of our popular and acclaimed shows and films will become an exclusive part of our owned and controlled library, including critically acclaimed hits Halt and Catch Fire, Turn, and Rectify, as well as all 11 seasons of The Walking Dead to be discovered and rediscovered by fans, driving growth and value across our portfolio.
Develop and Grow Targeted Streaming Offerings and Brands. For several years, we have focused on creating and growing targeted streaming services. Our targeted streaming strategy is to serve distinct premium audiences and build loyal and engaged fan communities around each service. We are taking a unique approach to the market, serving audiences with targeted offerings that are companions to the larger streaming services. As the market for this category evolves, consumers are increasingly complementing their general entertainment subscriptions with our targeted streaming services. With this strategy, we do not compete with the larger streaming offerings and this puts us in a very advantageous position as we continue to grow this area of our business. 
We are seeing the same affinities for our services from consumers overseas as we are in the U.S, and we are beginning to accelerate oversees expansion of our targeted streaming services. Our services, most notably AMC+, Acorn TV and Shudder have begun to launch in key international markets, including Canada, the UK, parts of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Latin America
Innovation in Content, Format and Distribution. We distribute our content across other platforms when it makes business sense to do so, so that our viewers can access our content where, when and how they want it. To that end, we have partnerships with all major streaming services and digital platforms, including Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime, to make our content available to their subscribers on various platforms permitting subscribers to access programs at their convenience, including electronic-sell-through (EST) and physical (DVD and Blu-ray) formats.
Growth and Innovation in Advertising. We continue to leverage our premium quality, popular content on our networks to optimize our advertising revenue. In addition, we are embracing new opportunities the evolving advertising space presents, including an expanding presence on advertising video on demand (AVOD) and free ad-supported streaming (FAST) platforms. To date, we have launched a total of seven distinct channels featuring our content, in different configurations, across major AVOD platforms, such as Pluto TV, Sling TV and Samsung TV Plus. We have increased the value of our linear and digital advertising inventory by establishing a leadership position in advanced advertising technologies, including addressable advertising and programmatic buying, to make it easier for a wider variety of advertisers to partner with us and to make the impressions they buy smarter and more effective. We have seen the number of advertisers utilizing these tools increase and our targeted audience advertising sales have grown as a result. In addition to our own initiatives, we are also participating in broader industry efforts focused on expanding the availability of addressable advertising. We believe our products enhance our value to advertisers through better targeting, data and measurement and we believe they will contribute to growth of our overall business in the mid and long term.
We are also creating new opportunities for brands to leverage the strength of our content and our large and passionate fan communities through custom content, on social platforms and also through on-the-ground live events centralized in an initiative called “The Content Room,” which provides a one-stop shop for advertisers to leverage the popularity of our original content in a variety of compelling and innovative ways. These opportunities are rooted in our strong content and proven ability to build vibrant, large and engaged fan communities around our shows and franchises.
Revenue
We earn revenue principally from the distribution of our programming and the sale of advertising. Distribution revenues primarily include fees paid by distributors to carry our programming networks, revenue earned from the licensing of original programming and subscription fees paid for our streaming services. In 2021, distribution revenues and advertising sales accounted for 69% and 31% of our consolidated revenues, net, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, no customer accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues, net.
Distribution Revenue
Subscription revenue: Our programming networks and, to an increasing extent, our streaming services are distributed to our viewing audience throughout the U.S. and around the world via cable and other multichannel video programming distribution platforms, including direct broadcast satellite ("DBS"), platforms operated by telecommunications providers and virtual MVPDs (collectively "distributors") pursuant to agreements with the distributors. Our programming networks' existing distribution agreements expire at various dates through 2028. For our streaming services, we earn monthly fees as the streaming service is provided to our customers.
We frequently negotiate with distributors in an effort to increase the subscriber base for our networks. We have in some instances made upfront payments to distributors in exchange for these additional subscribers. We also may help fund the distributors' efforts to market our programming networks and streaming services or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. As we continue our efforts to add subscribers, our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by such deferred carriage fee arrangements, discounted subscriber fees and other payments, however, we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period.
Content licensing revenue: We sell rights to our owned original programming and content acquired under long-term distribution arrangements for distribution in a variety of forms including television markets worldwide, streaming services or digital platform providers, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, electronic-sell-through (EST) and physical (DVD and Blu-ray) formats.
Advertising Revenue
We earn advertising revenue by selling advertising time on our programming networks, on digital platforms we own and also on an increasing number of AVOD platforms. In the United States, we sell advertising time in both the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season, and by purchasing in advance, often receive discounted rates. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run, and often pay a premium. The mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors, such as pricing, demand for advertising time and economic conditions. Internationally, advertising markets vary by jurisdiction. The majority of international advertising is sold close to the time when the commercials will be run (similar to the U.S. scatter market) and we are generally represented by third-party sales agents.
Our arrangements with advertisers provide for a set number of advertising units to air over a specific period of time at a negotiated price per unit. In most domestic advertising sales arrangements, our programming networks guarantee specified viewer ratings for their programming. If these guaranteed viewer ratings are not met, we are generally required to provide additional advertising units to the advertiser at no charge. For these types of arrangements, a portion of the related revenue is deferred if the guaranteed viewer ratings are not met and is subsequently recognized either when we provide the required 
additional advertising unit or the guarantee obligation contractually expires. In the United States, most of our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by Nielsen. In addition to the Nielsen rating, our advertising rates are also influenced by the demographic mix of our viewing audiences, since advertisers tend to pay premium rates for more desirable demographic groups of viewers.
Our programming networks have advertisers representing companies in a broad range of sectors, including automotive, restaurants/food, health, and telecommunications industries. 
Programming
We obtain programming through a combination of development, production and licensing; and we distribute programming directly to consumers in the United States and throughout the world through our programming networks, streaming services, theatrical release of acquired films and other forms of distribution. Our programming includes original programming that we control, either through outright ownership or through long-term licensing arrangements, as well as acquired programming that we license from studios and other rights holders. 
Original Programming
Through our AMC Studios operation, we increasingly produce and own more of our original programming, primarily for our programming networks and streaming services, and also for license to third parties worldwide. Decisions as to how to distribute programming are made on the basis of a variety of factors including the relative value of any particular alternative.
We also contract with some of the industry's leading production companies to produce original programming that appears on our programming networks and streaming services. These contractual arrangements either provide us with outright ownership of the programming, in which case we hold all programming and other rights to the content, or they consist of long-term licensing arrangements, which provide us with exclusive rights to exhibit the content on our programming networks, but may be limited in terms of specific geographic markets or distribution platforms. The license agreements are typically of multi-season duration and provide us with a right of first negotiation or a right of first refusal on the renewal of the license for additional programming seasons.
Acquired Programming
The majority of the content on our programming networks and streaming services consists of films, episodic series and specials that we acquire pursuant to rights agreements with film studios, production companies or other rights holders. This acquired programming includes episodic series such as Law and Order, The X-Files, Criminal Minds, CSI: Miami, Two and a Half Men and Batman, as well as an extensive film library. The rights agreements for this content are of varying duration and generally permit our programming networks and streaming services to carry these series, films and other programming during certain window periods.

REGULATION
Our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries in which they operate, as well as international bodies, such as the European Union. The Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") regulates U.S. programming networks directly in some respects; other FCC regulations, although imposed on cable television operators and satellite operators, affect programming networks indirectly. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change and increasingly, legislative and regulatory proposals seek to cover all sources of content, including the digital platforms over which we offer content, which may affect our regulatory burdens in the future. The descriptions below are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.
Closed Captioning
Certain of our networks must provide closed-captioning of programming for the hearing impaired, and comply with other regulations designed to make our content more accessible, and we must provide closed captioning on certain video content that we offer on the Internet or through other Internet Protocol distribution methods.
CALM Act
FCC rules require MVPDs to ensure that all commercials comply with specified volume standards, and our distribution agreements generally require us to certify compliance with such standards.
Emergency Alert Codes or Attention Signals
We may not include emergency alert codes or attention signals, or simulations of them, in our content under any circumstances other than a genuine alert, an authorized test of the emergency alert system, or a permissible public service announcement.
Obscenity Restrictions
Cable operators and other MVPDs are prohibited from transmitting obscene programming, and our distribution agreements generally require us to refrain from including such programming on our networks.
Program Carriage
The FCC's program carriage rules prohibit distributors from favoring their affiliated programming networks over unaffiliated similarly situated programming networks in the rates, terms and conditions of carriage agreements between programming networks and cable operators or other MVPDs. Recent regulatory changes and court decisions make it more difficult for our programming networks to challenge a distributor’s decision to decline to carry one of our programming networks or discriminate against one of our programming networks.
Packaging Programming and Volume Discounts
The FCC from time to time examines whether to adopt rules restricting how programmers package and price their networks, or whether to impose other restrictions on carriage agreements between programmers and MVPDs. We do not currently require distributors to carry more than one of our national programming networks in order to obtain the right to carry a particular national programming network. However, we generally negotiate with a distributor for the carriage of all of our national networks concurrently, and we offer volume discounts to distributors who make our programming available to larger numbers of subscribers or who carry more of our programming networks.
Some states also have sought to regulate the manner in which MVPDs package and offer programming. We generally do not allow our networks or individual programs on those networks today to be offered by distributors on an a la carte basis.
Effect of "Must-Carry" and "Retransmission Consent" Requirements
The FCC's implementation of the statutory "must-carry" obligations requires cable and DBS operators to give certain broadcasters preferential access to channel space and preferential channel positions, and FCC "retransmission consent" rules allow broadcasters to require cable and DBS operators to carry broadcast-affiliated networks as a condition of access to the local broadcast station and to charge substantial fees for both carriage of the local broadcast station and the broadcast-affiliated networks. In contrast, programming networks, such as ours, have no guaranteed right of carriage on cable television or DBS systems nor any guaranteed channel position. These carriage laws may reduce the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable television systems and DBS operators, or the amount of programming funds that cable and DBS operators have available for carriage of our networks.
Website Requirements
We maintain various websites that provide information regarding our businesses and offer content for sale. The operation of these websites may be subject to a range of federal, state and local laws such as privacy, data security, accessibility, child safety, oversight of user-generated content, and consumer protection regulations. For example, most states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations, and new frameworks regulating consumer privacy have recently been established at the state level and overseas, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or as amended, the CCPA. The GDPR and the CCPA impose, among other things, more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, and increased liability for violations. In addition, the FCC from time to time considers whether some or all websites offering video programming should be considered MVPDs and regulated as such.
Other Regulation
The FCC also imposes rules that may impact us regarding a variety of issues such as advertising in children's television, and telemarketing. Programming businesses are subject to regulation by the country in which they operate, as well as international bodies, such as the European Union. These regulations may include restrictions on types of advertising that can be sold on our networks, programming content requirements, requirements to make programming available on non-discriminatory terms, and local content quotas.
COMPETITION
Our programming services, consisting of linear networks and streaming services, operate in three highly competitive markets. First, our programming services compete with other programming services to obtain distribution on cable television systems and other multichannel video programming distribution systems, and ultimately for viewing by each distributor's subscribers. Second, our programming services compete with other programming services and other sources of video content, to secure desired entertainment programming. Third, our programming services compete with other sellers of advertising time and space, including other cable programming networks, radio, newspapers, outdoor media and, increasingly, internet sites. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to license and produce content for our programming services that is adequate in quantity and quality and will generate satisfactory viewer ratings. In each of these cases, some of our competitors are large publicly held companies that have greater financial resources than we do.
Distribution of Programming Services
The business of distributing programming services to cable television systems and other MVPDs and licensing of original programming for distribution is highly competitive. Our programming services face competition from other programming networks and services for carriage by a particular MVPD, and for the carriage on the service tier that will attract the most subscribers. Once our programming service is selected by a distributor for carriage, that service competes for viewers not only with the other programming services available on the distributor's system, but also with over-the-air broadcast television, Internet-based video and other online services, mobile services, radio, print media, motion picture theaters, DVDs, and other sources of information and entertainment.
Important to our success in each area of competition we face are the prices we charge for our programming services, the quantity, quality and variety of the programming offered on our services, and the effectiveness of our services' marketing efforts. The competition for viewers among advertiser supported networks is directly correlated with the competition for advertising revenues with each of our competitors.
Our ability to successfully compete with other networks and services may be hampered because the cable television systems or other MVPDs through which we seek distribution may be affiliated with other programming networks or services. In addition, because such distributors may have a substantial number of subscribers, the ability of such programming services to obtain distribution on the systems of affiliated distributors may lead to increased distribution and advertising revenue for such programming networks or services because of their increased penetration compared to our programming services. Even if such affiliated distributors carry our programming services, such distributors may place their affiliated programming network on a more desirable tier, thereby giving the affiliated programming network a competitive advantage over our own.
New or existing programming networks that are affiliated with broadcasting networks like ABC, CBS, Fox or NBC may also have a competitive advantage over our programming networks in obtaining distribution through the "bundling" of agreements to carry those programming networks with agreements giving the distributor the right to carry a broadcast station affiliated with the broadcasting network. 
Part of our strategy involves exploiting identified segments of the cable television viewing audience that are generally well defined and limited in size. Our networks have faced and will continue to face increasing competition as other programming networks and online or other services seek to serve the same or similar niches.
We also seek to increase our content licensing revenues by expanding the opportunities for licensing our programming through other media platforms and we compete with other programming companies in this market based on the desirability of our programming.
Sources of Programming
We also compete with other programming networks and other distributors including digital distribution platforms to secure desired programming. Most of our original programming and all of our acquired programming is obtained through agreements with other parties that have produced or own the rights to such programming. Competition for this programming will increase as the number of programming networks and other distributors increases. Other programming networks or streaming services that are affiliated with programming sources such as movie or television studios or film libraries may have a competitive advantage over us in this area.
With respect to the acquisition of entertainment programming, such as syndicated programs and movies that are not produced by or specifically for networks, our competitors include national broadcast television networks, local broadcast television stations, other cable programming networks, Internet-based video content distributors, and video-on-demand programs. Some of these competitors have exclusive contracts with motion picture studios or independent motion picture distributors or own film libraries.
Competition for Advertising Revenue
Our programming networks must compete with other sellers of advertising time and space, including other MVPDs, radio, newspapers, outdoor media and increasing shifts in spending toward online and mobile offerings from more traditional media. We compete for advertisers on the basis of rates we charge and also on the number and demographic nature of viewers who watch our programming. Advertisers will often seek to target their advertising content to those demographic categories they consider most likely to purchase the product or service they advertise. Accordingly, the demographic make-up of our viewership can be equally or more important than the number of viewers watching our programming.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
At AMC Networks, we are passionate about telling authentic stories that connect with audiences in meaningful ways and that entertain with vivid characters and worlds that show a full spectrum of the human experience. We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success. Our key human capital management objectives are to invest in and support our employees so that we have the ability to attract, develop and retain a high performing and diverse workforce.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
At AMC Networks being diverse, equitable, and inclusive is more than a business imperative that spurs creativity and drives innovation. It is at the heart of who we are and what we believe. 
Some examples of our DEI areas of focus are described below:
Fostering Inclusive Communities – We have nine active Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that form communities through shared interests and experiences with 18 chapters across the U.S, the UK, Europe and Latin America. Our ERG 
members strive to create a culture of belonging for our employees. They facilitate networking and connections with peers; support the acquisition of diverse talent internally and externally; provide an avenue to facilitate leadership and skill development; and help to increase the organization’s overall cultural competency. They are an important part of driving our business objectives, including curating themed content areas that helps drive streaming subscriber growth and acting as a valuable sounding board for content development and programming. 
Develop Talent Pipelines – We strive to create robust pipelines of diverse talent for our workplace to provide employment opportunities that are accessible for underrepresented communities. We do this through partnerships with leading industry diversity advocacy organizations and through our corporate internship program where we source candidates from a broad range of colleges including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs).
Learning Together – To equip our employees with the tools and knowledge they need to expand awareness and understand what promoting diversity, equity and inclusion really means, our employees participate in a variety of learning opportunities covering topics ranging from building a more equitable workforce to unconscious bias.
Our Content – We have a long track record of championing and supporting independent and diverse voices and using our platforms to bring these storytellers’ vision to life. Encouraging diverse and inclusive voices and points of view – on our screens, on our sets, and in our writer’s rooms – is fundamental to our creative process. It is how we understand, reflect, and speak with insight and authenticity to the wide range of audiences we reach every day. In 2021, over 50% of AMC Networks’ writers’ rooms were staffed with diverse writers. 
High Impact Partnerships – We work with leading industry organizations to ensure there is greater inclusion in the stories we tell. In 2021, we signed on to #ChangeHollywood in partnership with Color of Change and others to use inclusion riders on every AMC Studios production. We are proud to be a launch partner of Coded for Inclusion, a new job matching platform for production crews designed to help change the way hiring happens in Hollywood. Through our partnership in Mentorship Matters, we connect showrunners with emerging writers of color for dynamic year-long mentorships. These are just a few examples of our active partnerships and collaborations through which we strive to empower the next generation of storytellers. 
Talent
The Company employed 1,739 full-time employees and 287 part-time employees as of December 31, 2021. Our global workforce, as of December 31, 2021, was over 50% women, with 45% of our senior leadership positions (vice president or equivalent and above) held by women, including the Company’s first female Executive Officer, who joined the Company as Chief Financial Officer in January 2021 and who was promoted to a new dual role of Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer in October 2021. Over 28% of our U.S.-based workforce are people of color.
We aim to attract top talent through our corporate brand and our reputation for innovation and high-quality content, as well as through the many benefits we offer. We aim to retain our talent by emphasizing our competitive rewards; offering opportunities that support employees both personally and professionally; and our commitment to fostering a positive corporate culture.
Our performance management practice includes frequent feedback and conversations between managers and team members, and talent reviews designed to identify potential future leaders and inform succession plans. We value continuous learning and development opportunities for our employees, which include: a robust internal mentorship program; dynamic teams that take a cross disciplinary approach to driving innovation and problem solving; leadership development programs; and tuition assistance.
Our benefit offerings are designed to meet the range of needs of our diverse workforce and include: adoption assistance; backup child/elder care; child care resources; college planning; domestic partner coverage; domestic partner tax equalization; gender reassignment surgery; employee assistance programs; financial planning seminars; and a health advocate offering. These resources are intended to support the health, finance, and well-being of our employees.
In addition, for certain of our productions, the Company, through in-house and third-party production service companies, engages the services of writers, directors, actors and various crew members who are subject to certain specially negotiated collective bargaining agreements. Since these agreements are generally entered into on a per-project basis, negotiations occur on various agreements throughout the year. We believe that our relations with the labor unions and our employees are generally good.
Culture
Our Company has a proud past and a long history of innovation and originality in our storytelling. This legacy informs who we are and is imbued in our corporate culture and in our values. We embrace collaboration, openness, approachability, as well as agility and creativity.
Throughout the year we bring together partners, thought leaders and our creative talent for engaging and eye-opening conversations for our employees about our content, industry trends, and advancing DEI. 
Giving and social impact programs and initiatives are an important part of our culture because at AMC Networks we want to be a source for positive change in the communities where we live and work. Through philanthropic efforts, community outreach and strong and lasting partnerships, we support causes aimed at advancing a culture of inclusivity and amplify everyone’s voice. In 2021, we launched a new online giving and volunteering platform for our employees called Give Back at AMCN, dedicated to making an impact in the areas that matter most to our workforce. Employees can research and learn about organizations doing important and difference-making work and make personal charitable donations, which includes an annual company match. 
Other initiatives to foster community and social impact include paid time off for full-time employees for Juneteenth, Election Day, Veterans Day and a volunteer day of their choice.
