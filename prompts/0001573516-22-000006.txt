Item 1. BUSINESS
Murphy USA Inc. ("Murphy USA" or the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware on March 1, 2013 and holds, through its subsidiaries, the former U.S. retail marketing business of its former parent company, Murphy Oil Corporation (“Murphy Oil”), plus other assets and liabilities of Murphy Oil that supported the activities of the U.S. retail marketing operations. In addition, on January 29, 2021, the Company acquired Quick Chek Corporation ("QuickChek"), a privately held convenience store chain.
Our business consists primarily of the marketing of retail motor fuel products and convenience merchandise through a network of 1,679 (as of December 31, 2021) retail stores located in 27 states, of which, 1,151 were branded as Murphy USA, 370 were branded as Murphy Express, and 158 were branded as QuickChek stores. The majority of our retail gasoline stores operate under the brand name of Murphy USA and are almost all located in close proximity to Walmart stores while gasoline and other products at standalone stores are marketed under the brand name of Murphy Express. The Murphy branded stores are primarily located in the Southeast, Southwest, and Midwest areas of the United States. We also operate a combination of convenience stores and convenience stores with retail gasoline under the brand name of QuickChek, which are located in New Jersey and New York. In addition, we market to unbranded wholesale customers through a mixture of Company owned and third-party product distribution terminals and pipeline positions. As an independent publicly traded company, we have low-price, high volume fuel retail outlets selling convenience merchandise through low-cost small store formats and kiosks, as well as larger format stores that have a broader range of merchandise and food and beverage offerings that are driven by key strategic relationships and experienced management.

Our business is subject to various risks. For a description of these risks, see “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   

Information about our operations, properties and business segments, including revenues by class of products and financial information by geographic area, are provided on pages 30 through 44, F-13, F-15, and F-30 through F-31 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Competitive Strengths

Our business foundation is built around five reinforcing strengths which we believe provide us a competitive advantage over our peers. These strengths support our Company vision which is to “Deliver every day the quickest, most friendly service and a low-price value proposition to our growing customer base for the products and markets we serve.” 
Strategic proximity to and complementary relationship with Walmart
Of our network of 1,679 retail gasoline stores (as of December 31, 2021), the majority are situated on prime locations located near Walmart stores. We believe our proximity to Walmart stores generates significant traffic to our existing retail stores while our competitively priced gasoline and convenience offerings appeal to our shared customers. We continue to collaborate with Walmart on fuel discount programs, mainly Walmart+, which we believe enhances the customer value proposition as well as the competitive position of both Murphy USA and Walmart. 
Winning proposition with value-conscious consumers
Our competitively priced fuel is a compelling offering for value-conscious consumers. Despite a flat long-term outlook in overall gasoline demand (increased vehicle miles traveled in a normal economy essentially offsetting increased fuel efficiency), we believe value-conscious consumers that prefer convenience and service are a growing demand segment. In combination with our high traffic locations, our competitive gasoline prices drive high fuel volumes and gross profit. In addition, we believe we are an industry leader in per-store tobacco sales with our low-priced tobacco products and in total store sales per square foot as we also sell a growing assortment of single-serve/immediate consumption items.  We continue to provide value opportunities to our customers through our Murphy Drive Rewards loyalty program which rewards customers with discounted and free items based on purchases of qualifying fuel and merchandise.
Low cost retail operating model
We operate our Murphy USA and Murphy Express retail gasoline stores with a strong emphasis on fuel sales complemented by a focused convenience offering that allows for a smaller store footprint than most of our competitors. We build a mix of 1,400 square foot stores and new-to-industry ("NTI") 2,800 square foot stores which we believe have low capital expenditure, maintenance and utility requirements relative to our competitors. Many of our Murphy stores require only one or two associates to be present during business hours and 77% of our stores are located on Company-owned property and do not incur any rent expense. The combination of a focused convenience offering and standardized smaller footprint stores of our Murphy USA and Express brands allow us to achieve lower overhead costs and on-site costs compared to competitors with a much larger store format. Our low cost operating model translates into a low cash fuel breakeven requirement that allows us to weather extended periods of low fuel margins and which has improved by more than 4 cents per gallon ("cpg") since our spin-off in 2013.
Distinctive fuel supply chain capabilities 
We source fuel at very competitive industry benchmark prices due to the diversity of fuel options available to us in the bulk and rack product markets, our shipper status on major pipeline systems, and our access to numerous terminal locations. In addition, we have a strong distribution system in which we analyze intraday supply options and direct third-party tanker trucks to the most favorably priced terminal to load products for our Murphy stores and QuickChek stores with gasoline, further reducing our fuel product costs. By participating in the broader fuel supply chain, we believe our business model provides additional upside exposure to opportunities to enhance margins and volume, such as shifting non-contractual wholesale volumes to protect retail fuel supply during periods of constrained supply and elevated margins. These activities demonstrate our belief that participating in the broader fuel supply chain provides us with added flexibility to ensure reliable low-cost fuel supply in various market conditions especially during periods of significant price volatility or delivery difficulties. It would take substantial time and investment, both in expertise and assets, for a competitor to replicate our existing position, and we believe this continues to be a significant barrier to any attempt to emulate our business model.
 Resilient financial profile and engaged team
Our predominantly fee-simple asset base, ability to generate attractive gross margins through our low-price, high-volume strategy, and our low overhead costs should help us endure prolonged periods of unfavorable commodity price movements and compressed fuel margins. We also believe our conservative financial structure further protects us from the inherently volatile fuel environment. We expect that our strong cash position and availability under our credit facility will continue to provide us with a significant level of liquidity to help maintain a disciplined capital expenditure program focused on growing ratably through periods of both high and low fuel margins.
We have acquired through share repurchases approximately $1.9 billion of our common stock in a little more than eight years of operation. In October 2020, our Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $20 million remaining in the program which was completed in January 2022. In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $1 billion to be executed by December 31, 2026, to begin upon completion of the 2020 authorization. Additionally, in order to provide a consistent and meaningful return of capital to shareholders independent of share repurchases, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share, or $1.16 per share on an annualized basis, to our shareholders beginning in December 2021. 
We have 14,615 dedicated and hardworking employees as of December 31, 2021, that are actively engaged to serve the customer, whether it is the external retail consumer or their internal co-workers. We believe our sustainable business model and organic growth opportunities support an employee value proposition that makes Murphy USA an attractive place to work. 
Our Business Strategy
Our business strategy reflects a set of coherent choices that leverage our differentiated strengths and capabilities. 
Grow organically
We intend for our independent growth plan to be a key driver of our organic growth over the next several years, which is demonstrated by the 370 standalone Murphy Express locations (as of December 31, 2021) we have 
developed, the majority of which were developed after our 2013 spin-off from Murphy Oil Corporation. We expect to build up to 45 NTI locations and up to 35 raze-and-rebuilds in 2022 and are targeting up to 55 NTI and up to 25 raze-and-rebuilds per year in future periods, focusing on high-return locations either in high traffic areas, near Walmart Supercenters, or by strategic infill in our core market areas complemented by our supply chain capabilities. While we were previously focused on smaller lot sizes, we now expect to build more Murphy branded NTI stores that are 2,800 square feet or larger, as well as our NTI QuickChek branded locations in their existing footprint, which average between 5,000 to 7,000 square feet in size. Our real estate development team works to maintain a multi-year pipeline of projects that supports continued ratable expansion in these high-return locations.
Diversify merchandise mix 
We plan to continuously evaluate our remaining kiosk strategy in an effort to maximize our store economics and return on investment. Complementary to that strategy, we are continually refining Murphy branded 1,400 square foot and 2,800 square foot designs to create a foundation for increasing higher-margin non-tobacco sales and diversifying our merchandise offerings. Key to achieving the highest potential returns from our large and small format stores is the development and execution of enhanced food and beverage ("F&B") capabilities by leveraging QuickChek's F&B offering. We expect to further expand merchandise revenue and margins through our primary supplier relationship with Core-Mark Holding Company, Inc. ("Core-Mark") and in addition, to optimize our promotional planning, merchandise assortment, and pricing effectiveness, in order to help boost overall store returns. 
Sustain cost leadership position 
We believe that sustaining our low cost position is a strategic advantage as a retailer of commodity products. We are undertaking several initiatives for the purpose of increasing efficiency which should allow us to continue to beat inflation on per-store operating costs to help sustain low store-level costs. We also believe that through our planned growth and efficiency initiatives, we can control overhead costs to support an overall improvement in store returns and keep costs properly scaled as we grow organically. In order to do this successfully, we will focus on the continued development of our employees and foster an operating culture aligned with business performance, including cost leadership.
Create advantage from market volatility 
We plan to continue to focus our product supply and wholesale efforts on activities that enhance our ability to be a low-price retail fuel leader and our ability to take advantage of fuel price volatility. We will continue to invest in capabilities and asset positions that support our supply chain strategy. Our distinctive business model and supply chain advantage allows us to deliver consistent margins over time and withstand periods of volatility and uncertainty.
 Invest for the long term
We maintain a portfolio of predominantly fee-simple assets and utilize what we believe to be an appropriate debt structure that will allow us to be resilient during times of volatility in fuel demand, price, and margin. We believe our strong financial position should allow us to profitably execute our low-cost, high volume retail strategy through periods of both high and low fuel margins while preserving the ability to re-invest in and grow our existing stores, brand image and supporting capabilities such as enhancing our food and beverage offerings. Furthermore, in addition to our store-development capital and investments in new capabilities, we have diversified our shareholder distribution mechanism to provide consistent return of capital through quarterly cash dividends and meaningful share repurchase programs as we continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value.    
Industry Trends
We operate within the large, growing, competitive and highly fragmented U.S. retail fuel and convenience store industry. Several key industry trends and characteristics, include:
•Sensitivity to gas prices among cost conscious consumers, and increasing customer demand for low-priced fuel;
•Highly fragmented nature of the industry providing larger chain operators like Murphy USA with significant scale advantage; 
•Significantly increased fuel capacity in the marketplace by the addition of new-to-industry retail fuel and convenience stores, and
•High levels of consumer traffic around supermarkets and large format hypermarkets, supporting complementary demand at nearby and cross-promoted retail fuel stores.

Since 2007, we have purchased from Walmart the properties underlying many of our stores. Each of our owned properties that were purchased from Walmart are also subject to Easements and Covenants with Restrictions Affecting Land (“ECRs”), which impose customary restrictions on the use of such properties, which Walmart has the right to enforce. In addition, pursuant to the ECRs, certain transfers involving these properties are subject to Walmart’s right of first refusal or right of first offer. Also, pursuant to the ECRs, we are prohibited from transferring such properties to a competitor of Walmart.
For risks related to our agreements with Walmart, including the ECRs, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Walmart retains certain rights in its agreements with us, which may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.”

For the remaining stores located on or adjacent to Walmart property that are not owned, we have a master lease agreement that allows us to rent land from Walmart. The master lease agreement contains general terms applicable to all rental stores on Walmart property in the United States. The term of the leases is ten years at each store, with us holding four successive five-year extension options at each site. Approximately half of the leased sites have over 11 years of term remaining, including renewals, should the Company decide to exercise the renewal options. The agreement permits Walmart to terminate it in its entirety, or only as to affected sites, at its option under customary circumstances (including in certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency), or if we improperly transfer the rights under the agreements to another party. In addition, the master lease agreement prohibits us from selling a leased store or allowing a third party to operate a leased store without written consent from Walmart. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we own the sites of 1,047 of our Murphy USA stores and we lease and operate 99 Murphy USA sites from Walmart, and we also lease and sublease 3 other sites from Walmart. We have 5 Murphy USA sites located near Walmart locations where we pay rent to other landowners. As of December 31, 2021, we have 233 Murphy Express stores where we own the land and 137 locations where we rent the underlying land. All leases for Murphy branded stores are operating leases. 
As of December 31, 2021, we have 8 QuickChek stores of which we own the land and 150 QuickChek stores where we rent the underlying land and building. QuickChek has both operating and finance type leases and at December 31, 2021, had 30 stores with finance leases, 40 stores with operating leases and 80 stores which had both a finance and an operating lease. Of the operating leases, over half have an average remaining term, including renewals, of 25 years and of the finance leases, over half have an average remaining term, including renewals, of over 19 years. For more information about our operating leases, see Note 20 "Leases" to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2021. 
We have numerous sources for our retail fuel supply, including nearly all of the major and large oil companies operating in the U.S. We purchase fuel from oil companies, independent refiners, and other marketers at rates that fluctuate with market prices and generally are reset daily, and we sell fuel to our customers at prices that we establish daily. All fuel is delivered by the truckload as needed to replenish supply at our Company stores. Our inventories of fuel on site turn approximately once daily. By establishing motor fuel supply relationships with several alternate suppliers for most locations, we believe we are able to effectively create competition for our purchases among various fuel suppliers. We also believe that purchasing arrangements with multiple fuel suppliers may help us avoid product outages during times of motor fuel supply disruptions. At some locations, however, there are limited suppliers for fuel in that market and we may have only one supplier. Our refined products are distributed through a few product distribution terminals that are wholly owned and operated by us and from numerous terminals owned by others. About half of our wholly owned terminals are supplied by marine transportation and the rest are supplied by pipeline. We also receive products at terminals owned by others either in exchange for deliveries from our terminals or by outright purchase.
In addition to the motor fuel sold at our Company stores, our stores carry a broad selection of snacks, beverages, tobacco products and non-food merchandise, as well as a greater food and beverage offering at our QuickChek locations. In 2021, we purchased more than 70% of our merchandise from a single vendor, Core-Mark, with whom we renewed a new five-year supply agreement in January 2021.

Our business is organized into one reporting segment (Marketing).  The Marketing segment includes our retail marketing stores and product supply and wholesale assets. For operating segment information, see Note 22 “Business Segments” in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the three-year period ended December 31, 2021. 
Competition
The U.S. petroleum business is highly competitive, particularly with regard to accessing and marketing petroleum and other refined products. We compete with other chains of retail fuel stores for fuel supply and in the retail sale of refined products to end consumers, primarily on the basis of price, but also on the basis of convenience and consumer appeal. In addition, we may also face competition from other retail fueling stores that adopt marketing strategies similar to ours by associating with non-traditional retailers, such as quick service restaurants, supermarkets, discount club stores and hypermarkets, particularly in the geographic areas in which we operate. We expect that our industry will continue to trend toward this model, resulting in increased competition to us over time. Moreover, because we do not produce or refine any of the petroleum or other refined products that we market, we compete with retail gasoline companies that have ongoing supply relationships with affiliates or former affiliates that manufacture refined products. We also compete with integrated companies that have their own production and/or refining operations that are at times able to offset losses from marketing operations with profits from producing or refining operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed retail margins or supply shortages. In addition, we compete with other retail and wholesale gasoline marketing companies that have more extensive retail outlets and greater brand name recognition. Some of our competitors have been in existence longer than we have and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our business and may be able to respond better to changes in the economy and new opportunities within the industry.
The retail gasoline industry in the United States is highly competitive due to ease of entry and constant change in the number and type of retailers offering similar products and services. With respect to merchandise, our retail stores compete with other convenience store chains, independently owned convenience stores, supermarkets, drugstores, discount clubs, gasoline service stores, mass merchants, fast food operations and other similar retail outlets. Non-traditional retailers, including supermarkets, discount club stores and mass merchants, now compete directly with retail gasoline stores. These non-traditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the gasoline market, and their market share is expected to grow, and these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts, both at the fuel pump and in the convenience store, to encourage in-store merchandise sales and gasoline sales. In addition, some large retailers and supermarkets are adjusting their store layouts and product prices in an attempt to appeal to convenience store customers. Major competitive factors are: location, ease of access, product and service selection, gasoline brands, pricing, customer service, store appearance, cleanliness and safety.
Market Conditions and Seasonality
Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. Our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Pandemics such as COVID-19 may have adverse impacts on the business as travel restrictions and changed customer behavior may cause decreased store traffic and decreased demand for fuel and convenience store offerings.
Oil prices, wholesale motor fuel costs, motor fuel sales volumes, motor fuel gross margins and merchandise sales can be subject to seasonal fluctuations. For example, consumer demand for motor fuel typically increases during the summer driving season, and typically falls during the winter months. Therefore, our revenues and/or sales volumes are typically higher in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. Travel, recreation and construction are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate, increasing the demand for motor fuel and merchandise that we sell. A significant change in any of these factors, including a significant decrease in consumer demand (other than typical seasonal variations), could materially affect our motor fuel and merchandise volumes, motor fuel gross profit and overall customer traffic, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Trademarks
In the highly competitive business in which we operate, our trade names, service marks and trademarks are important to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. We sell gasoline primarily under the Murphy USA® and Murphy Express brands, which we acquired from Murphy Oil. We acquired ownership of the QuickChek® trademark and others as a result of the QuickChek acquisition. We are not aware of any facts which would negatively impact our continuing use of any of the above trade names, service marks or trademarks.
Technology Systems 
All of our Company stores use a standard hardware and software platform for point-of-sale (“POS”) that facilitates item level scanning of merchandise for sales and inventory, and the secure acceptance of all major payment methods – cash, check, credit, debit, fleet and mobile. In addition, our QuickChek stores have self-service checkouts and support third-party delivery services. Our standard approach to large scale and geographically dispersed deployments reduces total technology cost of ownership for the POS and inherently makes the system easier to use, support, and replace. This POS technology strategy reflects close alignment with our growth plan.
We use a combination of software as a service, commercial off the shelf software, and custom software applications developed using modern industry standard tools and methodologies to manage and run our business. For our financial systems, we use enterprise class systems which provide significant flexibility in managing corporate and store operations, as well as scalability for growth. 
We invest in disaster recovery, system backups, redundancy, firewall, remote access security and virus and spam protection to ensure a high level of system security and availability. We have systems, business policies and processes around access controls, password expirations and file retention to ensure a high level of control within our technology network.
Environmental
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements. Such environmental requirements have historically been subject to frequent change and have tended to become more stringent over time. While we strive to comply with these environmental requirements, any violation of such requirements can result in litigation, increased costs or the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, injunctions or other sanctions. Compliance with these environmental requirements affects our overall cost of business, including capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities, and ongoing operating expenditures. We maintain sophisticated leak detection and remote monitoring systems for underground storage tanks at most of our retail fueling stores and install up-to-date tank, piping, and monitoring systems at our new stores. We operate above ground bulk petroleum tanks at our terminal locations and have upgraded certain product lines and conduct annual monitoring to help mitigate the risk of potential soil and groundwater contamination. We allocate a portion of our capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and such capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $5.9 million in 2022. 
We could be subject to joint and several as well as strict liability for environmental contamination. Some of our current and former properties have been operated by third parties whose handling and management of hazardous materials were not under our control, and substantially all of them have or previously had motor fuel or petroleum product storage tanks. Pursuant to certain environmental laws, we could be responsible for investigating and remediating contamination relating to such stores, including impacts attributable to prior site occupants or other third parties, and for implementing remedial measures to mitigate the risk of future contamination. We may also have liability for contamination and violations of environmental laws under contractual arrangements with third parties, such as landlords and former owners of our sites, including at our sites in close proximity to Walmart stores. Contamination has been identified at certain of our current and former terminals and retail fueling stores, and we are 
continuing to conduct investigation and remediation activities in relation to such properties. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of further investigation or remediation obligations at these or other properties could result in significant costs. In some cases, we may be eligible to receive money from state “leaking petroleum storage tank” trust funds to help fund remediation. However, receipt of such payments is subject to stringent eligibility requirements and other limitations that can significantly reduce the availability of such trust fund payments and may delay or increase the duration of associated cleanups. We could also be held responsible for contamination relating to third-party sites to which we or our predecessors have sent hazardous materials for recycling or disposal. We are currently identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with one such disposal site. Any such contamination, leaks from storage tanks or other releases of regulated materials could result in claims against us by governmental authorities and other third parties for fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage. From time to time, we are subject to legal and administrative proceedings governing the investigation and remediation of contamination or spills from current and past operations, including from our terminal operations and leaking petroleum storage tanks.
Consumer demand for our products may be adversely impacted by fuel economy standards as well as greenhouse gas (“GHG”) vehicle emission reduction measures. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) issued Corporate Average Fuel Economy ("CAFE") standards in 2012 that set fuel economy standards and regulated emissions of GHGs for fleets of 2017-2025 model year cars and light duty trucks. In 2016, the NHTSA finalized a rule imposing stricter penalties against those who exceed CAFE standards. In 2019, the EPA and NHTSA jointly finalized part one of the Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient ("SAFE") Vehicles Rule, which reduced the penalties for violations of CAFE standards and revoked California's authority to set its own fuel economy standards. However, in December 2021, NHTSA published a final rule that repealed part one of the SAFE Vehicles Rule, meaning that California's ability to set its own standards will no longer be preempted by federal law. In March 2020, EPA and NHTSA finalized part two of the SAFE Vehicles Rule, which amended and made less stringent the 2012 CAFE fuel economy and emissions standards for fleets of 2021-2026 model year cars and light duty trucks. Subsequently, over the course of 2021 the agencies separately proposed, and the EPA finalized, standards that are more stringent than those in part two of the SAFE Vehicles Rule, with the proposed NHTSA CAFE standards addressing the 2024-2026 model years and the finalized EPA GHG standards addressing the 2023-2026 model years. The EPA and NHTSA also regulate GHG emission and fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles and in August 2016, jointly finalized "Phase 2" vehicle and engine performance standards covering model years 2021 through 2027, which apply to semi-trucks, large pick-up trucks and vans, and all types and sizes of buses and work trucks. These and any future increases in or changes to fuel economy standards or GHG emission reduction requirements could decrease demand for our products. 
Air emissions from our facilities are also subject to regulation. For example, certain of our fueling stores may be required to install and maintain vapor recovery systems to control emissions of volatile organic compounds to the air during the vehicle fueling process. Although the EPA declined to revise national ambient air quality standards for ground level ozone in December 2020, the EPA under a President Biden administration may revise such standards, which could require additional equipment upgrades and operating controls that could increase our capital and operating expenses.  Any other future environmental regulatory changes applicable to our business or operations may also result in increased compliance costs.
Our business is also subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations governing the content and characteristics of fuel. For example, the gasoline we sell generally must meet increasingly rigorous sulfur and benzene standards. In addition, renewable fuel standards generally require refiners and gasoline blenders to meet certain volume quotas or obtain representative trading credits for renewable fuels that are established as a percentage of their finished product production. Such fuel requirements and renewable fuel standards may adversely affect our wholesale fuel purchase costs. 
Sale of Regulated Products
In certain areas where our retail stores are located, state or local laws limit the hours of operation for the sale of alcoholic beverages and restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products to persons younger than a certain age. State and local regulatory agencies have the authority to approve, revoke, suspend or deny applications for and renewals of permits and licenses relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages, as well as to issue fines to convenience stores for the improper sale of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Failure to comply with these laws may result in the loss of necessary licenses and the imposition of fines and penalties on us. Such a loss or imposition could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations. In many states, retailers of alcoholic beverages have been held responsible for damages caused by intoxicated individuals 
who purchased alcoholic beverages from them. While the potential exposure for damage claims as a seller of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products is substantial, we have adopted procedures intended to minimize such exposure. We also adhere to the rules governing lottery sales as determined by state lottery commissions in each state in which we make such sales.
Safety
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 
Other Regulatory Matters
Our retail stores are also subject to regulation by federal agencies and to licensing and regulations by state and local health, sanitation, fire and other departments relating to the development and operation of retail stores, including regulations relating to zoning and building requirements and the preparation and sale of food. Difficulties in obtaining or failures to obtain the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new retail store in a particular area.
Our operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as wage rates, overtime and citizenship requirements. At the federal and state levels, there are proposals under consideration from time to time to increase minimum wage rates and periods of protected leaves. Increases in wages, overtime pay, or benefits due to changes in the statutory minimum salary requirements or minimum wage rates or mandated health benefits would result in an increase in our labor costs. Such cost increases, or the penalties for failing to comply, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We monitor such changes to ensure our continued compliance with these ever-changing regulations.
Human Capital
At Murphy USA, we know that the strength of our workforce is critical to our long-term success and we strive to build upon this through the foundation laid by our Principles. As of December 31, 2021, Murphy USA had 14,615 employees, including 6,245 full-time employees and 8,370 part-time employees working at our stores, support centers, and corporate headquarters.
Murphy USA is committed to the attraction, development, retention, and safety of our employees. Our initiatives for fiscal year 2021 addressed, among other things, (i) Our Principles, (ii) Inclusion and Diversity, (iii) Talent Management, (iv) Total Rewards, (v) Our COVID-19 Response, and (vi) Workforce Safety.
Our Principles are the heart of our rich culture, creating the foundation of how we operate at Murphy USA. They are the values that shape the strong character of our company. The basis for our human capital management focus is driven by our core Principles of Integrity, Respect, Citizenship, and Spirit. 

Integrity | Respect | Citizenship | Spirit 
Be persistently ethical and honest to foster trust. We carry ourselves with a quiet confidence because we know that – in the long run — our character will speak for itself. We always do the right thing, even when no one is watching. | Value and appreciate others. We encourage and promote diverse approaches in all our thoughts, ideas and actions. We understand the value gained through embracing the strengths, experiences, and perspectives of others. | Believe in the power of good actions. We are committed to the greater good for our employees, company, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. We are responsible and involved in the communities in which we live and work as ambassadors of Murphy USA. | Strive to be the best. We are highly engaged and truly care about what we do and how we are perceived. We have a strong desire to exceed our customers’ expectations. We work closely with each other to drive our success through reliable and consistent execution.

We are committed to living our Principles, specifically, the principle of "Respect" as it relates to inclusion and diversity. We are intentional about working towards increasing visible and invisible diversity throughout Murphy USA through several talent initiatives:
•We partner with universities to attract diverse talent.
•We identify critical roles and potential successors with our succession management program.
•We strive to lift up talent through differentiated and personalized development opportunities. 
We employ thoughtful talent management strategies, including annual succession planning, bi-annual people reviews, promotion review committees, mid-year and annual performance reviews, and cohort performance review calibrations.
We are dedicated to helping our employees succeed professionally by offering a robust suite of learning and development opportunities.
•Our field teams have comprehensive functional training programs at each level.
•We have individual development plans (IDPs) and an eLearning platform to support employee-driven development.
•Leadership development opportunities are available for all leaders.
•We provide tuition reimbursement for home office employees, store managers, and assistant store managers.
•We sponsor employees seeking to earn their GED.
We have demonstrated a history of investing in our employees by offering competitive salaries and wages. We offer comprehensive benefit packages designed to support employees' overall well-being. We have benefit packages available at all levels of the organization. The benefits package offered to our full-time employees includes:
•Comprehensive health, dental, vision, and life insurance.
•Parental leave available to all new parents for birth, adoption or foster placement.
•An Employee Assistance Program.
•401K program with company match.
•Paid time off including: vacation, sick, parental, bereavement, and holidays.
At present, all QuickChek benefit plans continue to operate as they did prior to our acquisition. We continue to evaluate QuickChek's benefit plans, and such evaluation could lead to consolidation with the Murphy USA plans in the future. The benefits offered by QuickChek are very similar to the benefits listed above.
We value the health, well-being and safety of our employees, customers, and communities. Our executive leadership team initiated a COVID-19 Crisis Response Team to address the critical safety, operational and business risks associated with the pandemic. In March 2020, we launched a voluntary work-from-home plan available to virtually all home-office based employees and revised critical work practices to promote a safer work environment for employees and our customers. We established a temporary Emergency Sick Pay program for store-level employees who were negatively impacted by COVID-19 and continued to support our employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic by offering these programs through July 2021. 
We are committed to keeping our employees and customers safe through fostering and maintaining a strong safety culture and emphasizing the importance of our employees’ role in identifying, mitigating and communicating safety risks. We have implemented a rapid response program to ensure safety events (i.e., slip and falls, medical emergencies, and vehicle accidents) are escalated quickly and responded to efficiently.
