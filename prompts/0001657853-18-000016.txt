ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OUR COMPANY
Hertz Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in 2015 to serve as the top-level holding company for Rental Car Intermediate Holdings, LLC, which wholly owns Hertz, Hertz Global's primary operating company. Hertz was incorporated in Delaware in 1967 and is a successor to corporations that have been engaged in the vehicle rental and leasing business since 1918. 
We operate our vehicle rental business globally through the Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands from approximately 10,200 corporate and franchisee locations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia, Australia, The Caribbean, the Middle East and New Zealand. We are one of the largest worldwide airport general use vehicle rental companies and our Hertz brand name is one of the most recognized in the world, signifying leadership in quality rental services and products. We have an extensive network of rental locations in the U.S. and in all major European markets. We believe that we maintain one of the leading airport vehicle rental brand market shares, by overall reported revenues, in the U.S. and at major airports in Europe where data regarding vehicle rental concessionaire activity is available. We are a leading provider of comprehensive, integrated vehicle leasing and fleet management solutions through our Donlen subsidiary.
OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We have identified three reportable segments, which are organized based on the products and services provided by our operating segments and the geographic areas in which our operating segments conduct business, as follows:

Markets and Competition
Competition among vehicle rental industry participants is intense and is primarily based on price, vehicle availability and quality, service, reliability, rental locations, product innovation, competition from online travel agents and vehicle rental brokers. We believe that the prominence and service reputation of the Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands, our extensive worldwide ownership of vehicle rental operations and our commitment to innovation and service provide us with a strong competitive foundation. 
U.S. 
The U.S. represents approximately $29 billion in estimated annual industry revenues for 2017. The average number of vehicles in the U.S. vehicle rental industry decreased 5% in 2017 to about 2.2 million vehicles. U.S. industry revenue per unit per month was approximately $1,091 which was an improvement of 6.5% over 2016. Rentals by airline travelers at or near airports (‘‘airport rentals’’) are influenced by developments in the travel industry and particularly in airline passenger traffic (‘‘enplanements’’) as well as the Gross Domestic Product (‘‘GDP’’). Off airport rental volume is primarily driven by local business use, such as vehicle repair shops, leisure travel and insurance replacements.
Our principal vehicle rental industry competitors in the U.S. are Avis Budget Group, Inc. (“ABG”) which currently operates the Avis, Budget, ZipCar and Payless brands and Enterprise Holdings, which operates the Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company ("Enterprise"), National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car brands. There are also local and regional vehicle rental companies, and transportation network companies which provide ride-hailing services that have some overlap in customer use cases, which are largely used for short length trips in urban areas. 
Europe
Europe represents approximately $16 billion in annual industry revenues. Europe has generally demonstrated a lower historical reliance on air travel. The European off airport vehicle rental market has been significantly more developed than it is in the U.S. Within Europe, the largest markets in which we do business are France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Throughout Europe, we do business through company-operated rental locations as well as through our partners or franchisees to whom we have licensed use of our brands.
Our principal pan-European competitors in the vehicle rental industry are Europcar, Enterprise Holdings, operating the Enterprise, National, Alamo brands and the Dooley, Citer and Atesa brands in Ireland, France and Spain, respectively, ABG operating the Avis, Budget, Payless and Zipcar brands and the Maggiore brand in Italy. In certain European countries, there are also other companies, and brands with substantial market shares, including Sixt SE, operating the Sixt brand in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
Asia Pacific
Asia Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand, represents approximately $13 billion in annual industry revenues. Within this region, the largest markets in which we do business are Australia, China, Japan and South Korea. In each of these markets we have company-operated rental locations or do business through our partners or franchisees to whom we have licensed use of our brands.
Our principal vehicle rental industry competitors in the Asia Pacific market place are ABG, operating the Avis, Budget, Apex and Zipcar brands, Europcar, and Enterprise Holdings, operating the Enterprise, National and Alamo brands and the Redspot brand in Australia and New Zealand.

Middle East and Africa
The Middle East and Africa represent approximately $3 billion in annual industry revenues. Within these regions, the largest markets in which we do business are Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. In each of these markets we do business through our franchisees to whom we have licensed use of our brands.
Our principal vehicle rental industry competitors in the Middle East market are ABG, operating the Avis, Budget, Payless and Zipcar brands, Europcar, Enterprise Holdings, operating the Enterprise, National and Alamo brands, and Sixt SE, operating the Sixt brand.
Latin America
The Latin America markets represent approximately $3 billion in annual industry revenues. Within Latin America the largest markets in which we do business are Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. In each of these markets our Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands are present through our partners or franchisees to whom we have licensed use of the respective brand. 
In Latin America, the principal vehicle rental industry competitors are ABG, operating the Avis, Budget and Payless brands, and Enterprise Holdings, which operates the Enterprise, National and Alamo brands. Other key players in the region are Localiza, JSL, operating the Movida brand, and Soluçônes Automôvel Globais, operating the Unidas brand.
In 2017, we completed the sale of our Brazil Operations to Localiza. As part of the sale, both companies entered into referral and brand cooperation agreements to govern their ongoing relationship which have an initial term of twenty years with an option to extend for another twenty years. The alliance also involves the exchange of knowledge in areas of technology, customer service and operational excellence. 
Brands
Our U.S. and International vehicle rental businesses are primarily operated through three brands - Hertz, Dollar, and Thrifty. We offer multiple brands in order to provide customers a full range of rental services at different price points, levels of service, offerings and products. Each of our brands generally maintains separate airport counters, reservations, marketing and other customer contact activities. We achieve synergies across our brands by utilizing a single fleet and fleet management team and combined maintenance, cleaning and back office functions, where applicable. 
Our top tier brand, Hertz, is one of the most recognized brands in the world, offering premium services that redefined the industry. This is consistent with numerous published best-in-class vehicle rental awards that we have won, both in the U.S. and internationally, over many years. We go to market under the tagline of “Hertz. We’re here to get you there” which is true to our promise and reputation for quality and customer service. We have a number of innovative offerings, such as Hertz Gold Plus Rewards; Hertz Ultimate Choice; our national-scale luxury rental program (“Prestige Collection”); our sports vehicle rental program (“Adrenaline Collection”); our environmentally friendly rental program (“Green Traveler Collection”); and, our elite sports and luxury vehicle rental program (“Dream Cars”). We continue to maintain our position as a premier provider of vehicle rental services through an intense focus on service, loyalty, quality and product innovation.
Our smart value brand, Dollar, is the choice for financially-focused travelers looking for a dependable car at a price they can afford. The Dollar brand’s main focus is serving the airport vehicle rental market, comprised of family, leisure and small business travelers. Dollar’s tagline of “We never forget whose dollar it is” indicates the brand’s mission to provide a reliable rental experience at a price that works. Dollar operates primarily through company-owned locations in the U.S. and Canada. We also globally license to independent franchisees which operate as a part of the Dollar brand system and have company-owned Dollar locations in certain countries. 
Our deep value brand, Thrifty, is the brand for savvy travelers who enjoy the “thrill of the hunt” to find a good deal. The Thrifty brand’s main focus is serving the airport vehicle rental market, comprised of leisure travelers. Thrifty’s tagline “Thrift Now, Splurge Later” indicates the brand’s focus on being the rental company that puts you in control of where you splurge and where you save. Thrifty operates primarily through company-owned locations in the U.S. and Canada.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

We also globally license to independent franchisees which operate as part of the Thrifty brand system and have company-owned Thrifty locations in certain countries. 
Internationally, we also offer our Firefly brand which is a deep value brand for price conscious leisure travelers. We have Firefly locations servicing local area airports in select international leisure markets where other deep value brands have a significant presence.
Operations
Locations
We operate both airport and off airport locations which utilize common vehicle fleets, are supervised by common country, regional and local area management, use many common systems and rely on common maintenance and administrative centers. Additionally, our airport and off airport locations utilize common marketing activities and have many of the same customers. We regard both types of locations as aspects of a single, unitary, vehicle rental business. Off airport revenues comprised approximately 33% of our worldwide rental vehicle revenues in 2017 and approximately 32% in 2016.
Airport
We have approximately 1,600 airport rental locations in the U.S. and approximately 1,500 airport rental locations internationally. Our international vehicle rental operations have company-operated locations in Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Slovakia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We believe that our extensive U.S. and international network of company-operated locations contributes to the consistency of our service, cost control, vehicle utilization, yield management, competitive pricing and our ability to offer one-way rentals.
For our airport company-operated rental locations, we have obtained concessions or similar leasing agreements or arrangements, granting us the right to conduct a vehicle rental business at the respective airport. Our concessions were obtained from the airports' operators, which are typically governmental bodies or authorities, following either negotiation or bidding for the right to operate a vehicle rental business. The terms of an airport concession typically require us to pay the airport's operator concession fees based upon a specified percentage of the revenues we generate at the airport, subject to a minimum annual guarantee. Under most concessions, we must also pay fixed rent for terminal counters or other leased properties and facilities. Most concessions are for a fixed length of time, while others create operating rights and payment obligations that are terminable at any time.
The terms of our concessions typically do not forbid us from seeking, and in a few instances actually require us to seek, reimbursement from customers for concession fees we pay; however, in certain jurisdictions the law limits or forbids our doing so. Where we are required or permitted to seek such reimbursement, it is our general practice to do so. Certain of our concession agreements may require the consent of the airport's operator in connection with material changes in our ownership. A growing number of larger airports are building consolidated airport vehicle rental facilities to alleviate congestion at the airport. These consolidated rental facilities provide a more common customer experience and may eliminate certain competitive advantages among the brands as competitors operate out of one centralized facility for both customer rental and return operations, share consolidated busing operations and maintain image standards mandated by the airports. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors” in this 2017 Annual Report.
Off Airport
We have approximately 2,600 off airport locations in the U.S. and approximately 4,500 off airport rental locations internationally. Our off airport rental customers include people who prefer to rent vehicles closer to their home or place of work for business or leisure purposes, as well as those needing to travel to or from airports. Our off airport customers also include people who have been referred by, or whose rental costs are being wholly or partially reimbursed by, insurance companies following accidents in which their vehicles were damaged, those expecting to lease vehicles that are not yet available from their leasing companies and replacement renters. In addition, our off airport customers

include drivers for our TNC partners, which is further described in “Item 1—Business—Customers and Business Mix” in this 2017 Annual Report.
When compared to our airport rental locations, an off airport rental location typically uses smaller rental facilities with fewer employees, conducts pick-up and delivery services and serves replacement renters using specialized systems and processes. On average, off airport locations generate fewer transactions per period than airport locations. 
Our off airport locations offer us the following benefits:

• | Provide customers a more convenient and geographically extensive network of rental locations, thereby creating revenue opportunities from replacement renters, non-airline travel renters and airline travelers with local rental needs;


• | Provide a more balanced revenue mix by reducing our reliance on air travel and therefore reducing our exposure to external events that may disrupt airline travel trends;


• | Contribute to higher vehicle utilization as a result of the longer average rental periods associated with off airport business, compared to those of airport rentals;


• | Insurance replacement rental volume is less seasonal than that of other business and leisure rentals, which permits efficiencies in both vehicle and labor planning; and


• | Cross-selling opportunities exist for us to promote off airport rentals among frequent airport Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program renters and, conversely, to promote airport rentals to off airport renters.

Rates
We rent a wide variety of makes and models of vehicles. We rent vehicles on an hourly (in select International markets), daily, weekend, weekly, monthly or multi-month basis, with rental charges computed on a limited or unlimited mileage rate, or on a time rate plus a mileage charge. Our rates vary by brand and at different locations depending on local market conditions and other competitive and cost factors. While vehicles are usually returned to the locations from which they are rented, we also allow one-way rentals from and to certain locations. In addition to vehicle rentals and franchisee fees, we generate revenues from reimbursements by customers of airport concession fees and vehicle licensing costs, fueling charges, and charges for value-added products and services such as supplemental equipment (child seats and ski racks), loss or collision damage waiver, theft protection, liability and personal accident/effects insurance coverage, premium emergency roadside service and satellite radio services.
Reservations
We accept reservations for our vehicles on a brand-by-brand basis, with each of our brands maintaining, and accepting reservations through, an independent internet site. Our brands generally accept reservations only for a class of vehicles, although Hertz accepts reservations for specific makes and models of vehicles in our Prestige Collection, our Adrenaline Collection, our Green Traveler Collection and our Dream Cars collection with a limited number of models in high-volume, leisure-oriented destinations. 
When customers reserve vehicles for rental from us and our franchisees, they may seek to do so through travel agents or third-party travel websites. In many of those cases, the travel agent or website will utilize a third-party operated computerized reservation system, also known as a Global Distribution System (“GDS”) to contact us and make the reservation. 
In major countries, including the U.S. and all other countries with company-operated locations, customers may also reserve vehicles for rental from us and our franchisees worldwide through local, national or toll-free telephone calls to our reservations center, directly through our rental locations or, in the case of replacement rentals, through proprietary automated systems serving the insurance industry. Additionally, we accept reservations for rentals worldwide through

our websites, for us and our franchisees. We also offer the ability to reserve vehicles through our smartphone apps for the Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands. 
Customer Service Offerings
At our major airport rental locations, as well as at some smaller airport and off airport locations, customers participating in our Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program are able to rent vehicles in an expedited manner. Participants in our Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program often bypass the rental counter entirely and proceed directly to their vehicle upon arrival at our facility. Participants in our Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program are also eligible to earn Hertz Gold Plus Rewards points that may be redeemed for free rental days or converted to awards of other companies' loyalty programs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, rentals by Hertz Gold Plus Rewards members accounted for approximately 34% of our worldwide rental transactions. We believe the Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program provides a significant competitive advantage to us, particularly among frequent travelers, and we have targeted such travelers for participation in the program. We offer electronic rental agreements and returns for our Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty customers in the U.S. Simplifying the rental transaction saves customers time and provides greater convenience through access to digitally available rental contracts. 
Our Hertz Ultimate Choice program offers customers who book a midsize class vehicle or higher the ability to choose the vehicle they drive from within the class reserved at no additional cost or to select a different vehicle from the Premium Upgrade zone for a fee. Also, Hertz Gold Plus Rewards members have access to exclusive Hertz Ultimate Choice lots that feature a wider selection of vehicles when they make a reservation for a midsize car or above. The Hertz Ultimate Choice program is offered at 52 U.S. airport locations as of December 31, 2017. The Company plans to expand the Hertz Ultimate Choice program to additional locations in 2018.
We also offer a Mobile Gold Alerts service, known as Carfirmations, through which an SMS text message and/or email is sent with the vehicle information and location, with the option to choose another vehicle from their smart phone prior to arrival. It is available to participating Hertz Gold Plus Rewards customers approximately 30 minutes prior to their arrival. We also offer Hertz e-Return, which allows customers to drop off their vehicle and go at the time of rental return. Additionally, in select locations customers can bypass the rental line through our ExpressRent Kiosks, and customers can use cashless toll lanes with our PlatePass offering where the license plate acts as a transponder.
TNC
We have partnered with certain companies in the TNC market and offer vehicle rentals to their drivers in approximately 80 locations in select U.S. cities across 14 states. Our participation in this market provides for an additional selection of higher mileage, and thus more economical used cars in our retail sales outlets. During 2017, we dedicated approximately 15,200 average vehicles for use by our TNC Partners. Drivers for our TNC Partners reserve vehicles online, through TNC Partner websites, and pick up vehicles from select off airport locations where rentals can be extended for up to four weeks on a weekly basis. 
Hertz 24/7
We offer a car-sharing membership service, referred to as Hertz 24/7, which rents vehicles by the hour and/or by the day, at various locations internationally, primarily in Europe and Australia. Members reserve vehicles online, then pick up the vehicles at various locations, such as a university, corporate campus or a retailer, without the need to visit a Hertz rental office. Members are charged an hourly or daily vehicle-rental fee which includes fuel, insurance, 24/7 roadside assistance and in-vehicle customer service.
Customers and Business Mix
We conduct active sales and marketing programs to attract and retain customers. Our sales force calls on companies and other organizations whose employees and associates need to rent vehicles for business purposes. In addition, our sales force works with membership associations, tour operators, travel companies and other groups whose members, participants and customers rent vehicles for either business or leisure purposes. Our specialized sales force calls on companies with replacement rental needs, including insurance and leasing companies, automobile repair

companies, and vehicle dealers. We also advertise our vehicle rental offerings through a variety of traditional media channels, such as partner publications, direct mail and digital marketing. In addition to advertising, we conduct a variety of other forms of marketing and promotion, including travel industry business partnerships and press and public relations activities. 
We categorize our vehicle rental business based on (i) the purpose for which customers rent from us (business or leisure) and (ii) the type of location from which they rent (airport or off airport). The following charts set forth the percentages of rental revenues and rental transactions in our U.S. and international operations based on these categories.

Customers who rent from us for “business” purposes include those who require vehicles in connection with commercial activities, including drivers for our TNC Partners, the activities of governments and other organizations or for temporary vehicle replacement purposes. Most business customers rent vehicles from us on terms that we have negotiated with their employers or other entities with which they are associated, and those terms can differ substantially from the terms on which we rent vehicles to the general public. We have negotiated arrangements relating to vehicle rental with many businesses, governments and other organizations, including most Fortune 500 companies.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

Customers who rent from us for “leisure” purposes include not only individual travelers booking vacation travel rentals with us but also people renting to meet other personal needs. Leisure rentals, generally, are longer in duration and generate more revenue per transaction than business rentals. Leisure rentals also include rentals by customers of U.S. and international tour operators, which are usually a part of tour packages that can include air travel and hotel accommodations. 
VEHICLE RENTALS BY LOCATION

Airport 
Off airport

Our business and leisure customers rent from both our airport and off airport locations. Demand for airport rentals is correlated with airline travel patterns, and transaction volumes generally follow enplanement and GDP trends on a global basis. Customers often make reservations for airport rentals when they book their flight plans, which make our strong relationships with travel agents, associations and other partners (e.g., airlines) a key competitive strategy in generating consistent and recurring revenue streams.
Off airport rentals include insurance replacements, therefore, we have established agreements with the referring insurers establishing the relevant rental terms, including the arrangements made for billing and payment. We have identified 198 insurance companies, ranging from local or regional vehicle carriers to large, national companies, as our target insurance replacement market. As of December 31, 2017, we were a preferred or recognized supplier for 129 of these insurance companies and a co-primary for 42 of them.

Fleet
We believe we are one of the largest private sector purchasers of new vehicles in the world. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we operated a peak rental fleet in the U.S. of approximately 504,300 vehicles and a peak rental fleet in our international operations of approximately 201,500 vehicles, and in each case exclusive of our franchisees' fleet and Donlen's leasing fleet. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our approximate average holding period for a rental vehicle was 17 months in the U.S. and 14 months in our international operations.
Our fleet composition at December 31, 2017 is as follows:

Purchases of vehicles are financed by active and ongoing global borrowing programs and through cash from operations. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in this 2017 Annual Report.
The vehicles we purchase are either program vehicles or non-program vehicles. We periodically review the efficiencies of an optimal mix between program and non-program vehicles in our fleet and adjust the ratio of program and non-program vehicles in our fleet as needed based on contract negotiations and vehicle economics.
For program vehicles, under our repurchase programs, the manufacturers agree to repurchase vehicles at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the vehicles during established repurchase or auction periods, subject to, among other things, certain vehicle condition, mileage and holding period requirements. Repurchase prices under repurchase programs are based on the original cost less a set daily depreciation amount. Guaranteed depreciation programs guarantee on an aggregate basis the residual value of the vehicles covered by the programs upon sale according to certain parameters which include the holding period, mileage and condition of the vehicles. These repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs limit our residual risk with respect to vehicles purchased under the programs and allow us to reduce the variability of depreciation expense for each vehicle, however, typically the acquisition cost is higher. Program vehicles generally provide us with flexibility to increase or reduce the size of our fleet based on economic demand. When we increase the percentage of program vehicles, the average age of our fleet decreases since the average holding period for program vehicles is shorter than for non-program vehicles.
Program vehicles as a percentage of all vehicles purchased within each of our U.S. and International vehicle rental segments were as follows:
Non-program vehicles are not purchased under repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs. Rather, we dispose of non-program vehicles, as well as program vehicles that become ineligible for manufacturer repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs, through a variety of disposition channels, including auctions, brokered sales, sales to wholesalers and sales to dealers. We also dispose of vehicles at our own Hertz retail sales outlets, primarily in the U.S. which consists of a network of 80 company-operated vehicle sales locations dedicated to the sale of used vehicles from our rental fleet. Vehicles disposed of through our retail outlets allow us the opportunity for value-added service revenue, such as warranty and financing and title fees.

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

We also offer Rent2Buy in 35 states and several European countries, an innovative program designed to sell used rental vehicles. Customers have an opportunity for a test rental of a vehicle from our rental fleet. If the customer purchases the vehicle, he or she is credited with a portion of their rental charges. The purchase transaction is completed through the internet and by mail in those states where permitted.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, of the vehicles sold in our U.S. vehicle rental operations that were not repurchased by manufacturers, we sold approximately 32% at auction, 39% through dealer direct and 29% at retail locations or through our Rent2Buy program. During the year ended December 31, 2017, of the vehicles sold in our international vehicle rental operations that were not repurchased by manufacturers, we sold approximately 15% at auction, 74% through dealer direct and 11% at retail locations or through our Rent2Buy program.
We maintain automobile maintenance centers at or near certain airports and in certain urban and off airport areas, which provide maintenance for our vehicles. Many of these facilities include sophisticated vehicle diagnostic and repair equipment and are accepted by automobile manufacturers as eligible to perform and receive reimbursement for warranty work. Collision damage and major repairs are generally performed by independent contractors.
Franchisees
In certain U.S. and international markets, we have found it efficient to utilize independent franchisees, which rent vehicles that they own, primarily under our Hertz, Dollar, or Thrifty brands. In certain markets and under certain circumstances, franchisees are given the opportunity to acquire franchises for multiple brands. 
We believe that our franchisee arrangements are important to our business because they enable us to offer expanded national and international service and a broader one-way rental program. Licenses are issued principally by our wholly-owned subsidiaries, under franchise arrangements to independent franchisees and affiliates who are engaged in the vehicle rental business in the U.S. and in many other countries.
Franchisees generally pay fees based on a percentage of their revenues. The operations of all franchisees, including the purchase and ownership of vehicles, are financed independently by the franchisees, and we do not have any investment interest in the franchisees or their fleets. Fees from franchisees, including initial franchise fees, are used to, among other things, generally support the cost of our brand awareness programs, reservations system, sales and marketing efforts and certain other services and are less than 2% of our consolidated revenues each period. In return, franchisees are provided the use of the applicable brand name, certain operational support and training, reservations through our reservations channels, and other services. In addition to vehicle rental, certain franchisees outside the U.S. engage in vehicle leasing, chauffeur-driven rentals and renting camper vans and motorcycles.
U.S. franchisees ordinarily are limited as to transferability without our consent and are terminable by us only for cause or after a fixed term. Many of these agreements also include a right of first refusal on the part of the Company should a franchisee receive a bona fide offer to sell. Franchisees in the U.S. may generally terminate for any reason on 90 days' notice. In Europe and certain other international jurisdictions, franchisees typically do not have early termination rights. Initial license fees or the price for the sale to a franchisee of a company-owned location may be payable over a term of several years. We continue to issue new licenses and, from time to time, purchase franchisee businesses.
Seasonality
Our vehicle rental operations are a seasonal business, with decreased levels of business in the winter months and heightened activity during spring and summer peak ("our peak season") for the majority of countries where we generate our revenues. To accommodate increased demand, we increase our available fleet and staff during the second and third quarters of the year. As business demand declines, vehicles and staff are decreased accordingly. Certain operating expenses, including real estate taxes, rent, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other facility-related expenses, the costs of operating our information technology systems and minimum staffing costs, remain fixed and cannot be adjusted for seasonal demand.

Donlen’s leased fleet consists primarily of passenger vehicles, cargo vans and light trucks. Vehicles are acquired directly from domestic and foreign manufacturers, as well as dealers. As of December 31, 2017, more than half of Donlen’s leased fleet is 2016 model year or newer.
Donlen’s primary product for vehicle and light to medium truck fleets is an open-ended terminal rental adjustment clause ("TRAC") lease. For most customers, the vehicle must be leased for a minimum of 12 months, after which the lease converts to a month-to-month lease allowing the vehicle to be surrendered any time thereafter. Our sale of the vehicle following the termination of the lease may result in a TRAC adjustment, through which the customer is credited or charged with the surplus or loss on the vehicle. Approximately 80% of Donlen’s lease portfolio consists of floating-rate leases which allow lease charges to be adjusted based on benchmark indices.

Donlen offers financing solutions for heavier-duty trucks and equipment. Lease financing is provided through syndication arrangements with lending institutions. Donlen originates the leases, acquires the assets, and services the lease throughout the term.
Donlen provides services to leased and non-leased fleets consisting of fuel purchasing and management, preventive maintenance, repair consultation, toll management and accident management. Additionally, Donlen manages license and title, vehicle registration, and regulatory compliance. Donlen’s telematics products provide enhanced visibility and reporting over driver and vehicle performance.
The commercial fleet market is one of the largest segments of the U.S. automotive industry, primarily consisting of vehicles utilized in a sales, service, or delivery application. The fleet management industry has experienced significant consolidation over the years and today our principal fleet management competitors in the U.S. and Canada are Enterprise, Automotive Resources International, Element Financial Corporation, Wheels, Inc. and LeasePlan Corporation N.V.
EMPLOYEES 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 37,000 persons, consisting of approximately 28,000 persons in our U.S. operations and approximately 9,000 persons in our international operations. International employees are covered by a wide variety of union contracts and governmental regulations affecting, among other things, compensation, job retention rights and pensions. Labor contracts covering the terms of employment of approximately 25% of our workforce in the U.S. (including those in the U.S. territories) are presently in effect under active contracts with local unions, affiliated primarily with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the International Association of Machinists. Labor contracts covering almost 15% of these employees will expire during 2018. We have had no material work stoppage as a result of labor problems during the last ten years, and we believe our labor relations to be good. Nevertheless, we may be unable to negotiate new labor contracts on terms advantageous to us, or without labor interruption. 
In addition to the employees referred to above, we engage outside services, as is customary in the industry, principally for the non-revenue movement of rental vehicles between rental locations.
INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
There are three types of generally insurable risks that arise in our operations:

• | legal liability arising from the operation of our vehicles (vehicle liability);


• | legal liability to members of the public and employees from other causes (general liability/workers' compensation); and


• | risk of property damage and/or business interruption and/or increased cost of operating as a consequence of property damage.

In addition, we offer optional liability insurance and other products providing insurance coverage, which create additional risk exposures for us. Our risk of property damage is also increased when we waive the provisions in our rental contracts that hold a renter responsible for damage or loss under an optional loss or damage waiver that we offer. We bear these and other risks, except to the extent the risks are transferred through insurance or contractual arrangements.
In many cases we self-insure our risks or insure risks through wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries. We mitigate our exposure to large liability losses by maintaining excess insurance coverage, subject to deductibles and caps, through unaffiliated carriers. For our international operations outside of Europe, and for our long-term vehicle leasing operations, we maintain some liability insurance coverage with unaffiliated carriers.

Third-Party Liability
In our U.S. operations, we are required by applicable financial responsibility laws to maintain insurance against legal liability for bodily injury (including death) or property damage to third parties arising from the operation of our vehicles and on-road equipment, sometimes called “vehicle liability,” in stipulated amounts. In most places, we satisfy those requirements by qualifying as a self-insurer, a process that typically involves governmental filings and demonstration of financial responsibility, which sometimes requires the posting of a bond or other security. In the remaining places, we obtain an insurance policy from an unaffiliated insurance carrier and indemnify the carrier for any amounts paid under the policy. As a result of such arrangements, we bear economic responsibility for U.S. vehicle liability, except to the extent we successfully transfer such liability to others through insurance or contractual arrangements.
For our vehicle rental operations in Europe, we have established a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Probus Insurance Company Europe Limited (“Probus”), a direct writer of insurance domiciled in Ireland. In European countries with company-operated locations, we have purchased from Probus the vehicle liability insurance required by law, and Probus reinsured the risks under such insurance with HIRE Bermuda Limited, a wholly-owned reinsurance company domiciled in Bermuda. This coverage is purchased from unaffiliated carriers for Spain and Italy. Thus, as with our U.S. operations, we bear economic responsibility for vehicle liability in our European vehicle rental operations, except to the extent that we transfer such liability to others through insurance or contractual arrangements. For our international operations outside of Europe, we maintain some form of vehicle liability insurance coverage with unaffiliated carriers. The nature of such coverage, and our economic responsibility for covered losses, varies considerably. In all cases, though, we believe the amounts and nature of the coverage we obtain is adequate in light of the respective potential hazards.
In our U.S. and international operations, from time to time in the course of our business, we become legally responsible to members of the public for bodily injury (including death) or property damage arising from causes other than the operation of our vehicles, sometimes known as “general liability.” As with vehicle liability, we bear economic responsibility for general liability losses, except to the extent we transfer such losses to others through insurance or contractual arrangements. In addition, to mitigate these exposures, we maintain excess liability insurance coverage with unaffiliated insurance carriers.
In our U.S. vehicle rental operations, we offer an optional liability insurance product, Liability Insurance Supplement (“LIS”) that provides vehicle liability insurance coverage substantially higher than state minimum levels to the renter and other authorized operators of a rented vehicle. LIS coverage is primarily provided under excess liability insurance policies issued by an unaffiliated insurance carrier, the risks under which are reinsured with a wholly-owned subsidiary, HIRE Bermuda Limited.
In our U.S. vehicle rental operations and our company-operated international vehicle rental operations in many countries, we offer optional products providing Personal Accident Insurance / Personal Effects Coverage (“PAI/PEC”) and Emergency Sickness Protection ("ESP") insurance coverage to the renter and the renter's immediate family members traveling with the renter for accidental death or accidental medical expenses arising during the rental period or for damage or loss of their property during the rental period. PAI/PEC and ESP coverage is provided under insurance policies issued by unaffiliated carriers or, in Europe, by Probus, and the risks under such policies either are reinsured with HIRE Bermuda Limited or are the subject of indemnification arrangements between us and the carriers. 
Our offering of LIS, PAI/PEC and ESP coverage in our U.S. vehicle rental operations is conducted pursuant to limited licenses or exemptions under state laws governing the licensing of insurance producers. 
Provisions on our books for self-insured public liability and property damage vehicle liability losses are made by charges to expense based upon evaluations of estimated ultimate liabilities on reported and unreported claims. As of December 31, 2017, this liability was estimated at $427 million for our combined U.S. and international operations.

Damage to Our Property
We bear the risk of damage to our property, unless such risk is transferred through insurance or contractual arrangements.
To mitigate our risk of large, single-site property damage losses globally, we maintain property insurance with unaffiliated insurance carriers in such amounts as we deem adequate in light of the respective hazards, where such insurance is available on commercially reasonable terms.
Our rental contracts typically provide that the renter is responsible for damage to or loss (including loss through theft) of rented vehicles. We generally offer an optional rental product, known in various countries as “loss damage waiver,” “collision damage waiver” or “theft protection,” under which we waive or limit our right to make a claim for such damage or loss. 
Collision damage costs and the costs of stolen or unaccounted-for vehicles, along with other damage to our property, are charged to expense as incurred, net of reimbursements.
Other Risks
To manage other risks associated with our businesses, or to comply with applicable law, we purchase other types of insurance carried by business organizations, such as worker's compensation and employer's liability, commercial crime and fidelity, performance bonds, directors' and officers' liability insurance and cyber security coverage from unaffiliated insurance companies in amounts deemed by us to be adequate in light of the respective hazards, where such coverage is obtainable on commercially reasonable terms.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Throughout the world, we are subject to numerous types of governmental controls, including those relating to prices and advertising, privacy and data protection, currency controls, labor matters, credit and charge card operations, insurance, environmental protection, used vehicle sales and licensing.
Environmental
We are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws, regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, the operation and maintenance of vehicles, trucks and other vehicles, buses and vans; the ownership and operation of tanks for the storage of petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel fuel and oil; and the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of waste materials, including oil, vehicle wash sludge and waste water. 
As of December 31, 2017, we have accrued approximately $2 million for environmental remediation. The accrual generally represents the estimated cost to study potential environmental issues at sites deemed to require investigation or clean-up activities, and the estimated cost to implement remediation actions, including ongoing maintenance, as required. Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus future costs associated with such matters may exceed the amount of the current accrual.
Dealings with Renters
In the U.S., vehicle rental transactions are generally subject to Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code, which governs “leases” of tangible personal property. Vehicle rental is also specifically regulated in more than half of the states of the U.S. and many other international jurisdictions. The subjects of these regulations include the methods by which we advertise, quote and charge prices, the consequences of failing to honor reservations, the terms on which we deal with vehicle loss or damage (including the protections we provide to renters purchasing loss or damage waivers)

and the terms and method of sale of the optional insurance coverage that we offer. Some states (including California, New York, Nevada and Illinois) regulate the price at which we may sell loss or damage waivers, and many state insurance regulators have authority over the prices and terms of the optional insurance coverage we offer. See “Insurance and Risk Management-Damage to Our Property” above for further discussion regarding the loss or damage waivers and optional insurance coverages that we offer renters. In addition, various consumer protection laws and regulations may generally apply to our business operations. Internationally, regulatory regimes vary greatly by jurisdiction, but they do not generally prevent us from dealing with customers in a manner similar to that employed in the U.S.
Both in the U.S. and internationally, we are subject to increasing regulation relating to customer privacy and data protection. In general, we are limited in the uses to which we may put data that we collect about renters, including the circumstances in which we may communicate with them. In addition, we are generally obligated to take reasonable steps to protect customer data while it is in our possession. Our failure to do so could subject us to substantial legal liability, require us to bear significant remediation costs, or seriously damage our reputation.
Changes in Regulation
Changes in government regulation of our businesses have the potential to materially alter our business practices, or our profitability. Depending on the jurisdiction, those changes may come about through new legislation, the issuance of new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and treaties by a court, regulatory body or governmental official. Those changes may have prospective and/or retroactive effect, particularly when a change is made through reinterpretation of laws or regulations that have been in effect for some time. Moreover, changes in regulation that may seem neutral on their face may have a significant effect on us than on our competitors, depending on the circumstances. Several U.S. State Attorneys General have taken the position that vehicle rental companies either may not pass through costs and fees to customers, by means of separate charges, expenses such as vehicle licensing and concession fees or may do so only in certain limited circumstances. Recent or potential changes in law or regulation that affect us relate to insurance intermediaries, customer privacy, like-kind exchange programs, data security and rate regulation and our retail vehicle sales operations.
In addition, our operations, as well as those of our competitors, also could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. We are not aware of any current proposal to impose such a regime in the U.S. or internationally. Such a regime could, however, be quickly imposed if there was a serious disruption in supply for any reason, including an act of war, terrorist incident or other problem affecting petroleum supply, refining, distribution or pricing.
