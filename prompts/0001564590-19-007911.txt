Item 1. Business. 
Merger of Versartis, Inc. and Aravive Biologics, Inc. 
 On October 12, 2018, we, then known as Versartis, Inc. and Aravive Biologics, Inc. or Private Aravive, completed a merger and reorganization, or the Merger, pursuant to which Private Aravive survived as our wholly owned subsidiary.  In connection with the completion of the Merger, on October 15, 2018, we changed our name from Versartis, Inc.  to “Aravive, Inc.” and on October 16, 2018, we effected a reverse split of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-6, or the Reverse Split, On October 16, 2018, our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “ARAV.” Unless otherwise stated, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split.
 Immediately following the completion of the Reverse Split and the Merger, there were approximately 11,182,025 shares of our common stock outstanding, of which approximately 5,141,915 were owned by the former Private Aravive stockholders. In addition, we assumed Private Aravive’s equity incentive plans and all of the stock options outstanding under the Private Aravive’s equity incentive plans, with such stock options representing at the effective time of the Merger the right for the former Private Aravive stockholders to purchase approximately 1,183,950 shares of our common stock. 
 Unless otherwise indicated, all references to “Aravive,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Aravive, Inc.(the combined company formerly known as Versartis, Inc.) and references to “Versartis, Inc.” or “Private Aravive.” refer to those respective companies prior to the completion of the Merger.
 Overview 
 Upon effecting the Merger, we became a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing new therapies that target important survival pathways for both advanced solid tumors as well as hematologic malignancies. 
 Our primary therapeutic focus is the GAS6-AXL pathway, where AXL receptor signaling plays an important role in multiple types of malignancies by promoting metastasis, cancer cell survival, resistance to treatments, and immune suppression. Our technology originated in the laboratories of Dr. Amato Giaccia and his colleagues at Stanford University. In August 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, designated as a Fast Track development program the investigation of our lead development candidate, AVB-S6-500, for platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.
 Our AXL decoy program, referred to as AVB-S6, is comprised of a family of novel, high-affinity, soluble Fc-fusion proteins designed to block the activation of the GAS6-AXL signaling pathway by intercepting the binding of GAS6 to its receptor AXL. We have generated preclinical data for AVB-S6 proteins in both acute myeloid leukemia and certain advanced solid tumors including ovarian, renal, pancreatic, and breast cancers.
 Our current development program benefits from the availability of a complementary serum-based biomarker that we expect will help accelerate drug development and reduce risk by allowing us to select a pharmacologically active dose, to better monitor therapeutic responses and potentially to better select responder patient populations. 
 In our recently completed Phase 1 clinical trial with AVB-S6-500, the lead development candidate selected from the AVB-S6 family of proteins, we demonstrated clinical proof-of-mechanism for AVB-S6-500 in neutralizing GAS6. In an analysis of the single ascending dose portion of the trial, all doses of AVB-S6-500 administration resulted in a decrease measurable, circulating free GAS6 in serum. The duration of suppression of serum GAS6 increased with increasing AVB-S6-500 doses. Importantly, AVB-S6-500 had a favorable safety profile in this first in human trial and in preclinical studies. In December 2018, we initiated the Phase 1b portion of our first Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in in patients with platinum- resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. In February 2019, we announced our plans to initiate clinical trials with AVB-S6-500 in our second oncology indication, patients with Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC), and we also announced our plans to conduct a small open label clinical trial with AVB-S6-500 in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN).
 In 2016, Private Aravive was approved for a $20 million Product Development Award from the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas, or CPRIT, which is one of the largest single grants that CPRIT has awarded to date based on information published on CPRIT’s website. All of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was grant revenue received from CPRIT.

Phase 1 Clinical Trial
 We recently completed our initial Phase 1 clinical trial with our lead protein, AVB-S6-500, in 42 dosed normal healthy volunteers. Subjects in the Phase 1 trial were given single ascending intravenous, or IV, doses and 4 weekly repeat IV doses of AVB-S6-500. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability in healthy subjects of intravenous AVB-S6-500. Secondary objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous AVB-S6-500 over a range of dose levels and at a single dose level (5mg/kg) for a total of 4 weekly doses.

There were no adverse events, or AEs, classified as serious and no dose-related AEs. Treatment-emergent AEs were generally mild, transient, and self-limiting. No anti-drug antibodies were noted. As anticipated from preclinical studies, a maximum tolerated dose was not reached and AVB-S6-500 was well-tolerated across all doses (1-10mg/kg single doses and 4 weekly 5mg/kg doses). The clinical trial met the safety and tolerability endpoints for the trial and demonstrated clinical proof-of-mechanism for AVB-S6-500 at all doses in neutralizing GAS6, as all doses tested in human subjects suppressed serum GAS6 for at least one week. Serum GAS6 levels were suppressed until 22 and 29 days following the 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses, respectively. Weekly administration of 5mg/kg resulted in suppression of sGAS6 in 4 out of 6 subjects for at least 3 weeks after the fourth dose.
 


In August 2018, the FDA, designated as a Fast Track development program the investigation of our lead development candidate, AVB-S6-500, for platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.
 By conducting the Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers, we expect that we will not need to conduct any additional Phase 1 studies for other indications in which AVB-S6-500 is the product candidate, and instead expect to have the ability to have as our first clinical trial for such other indications a Phase 1b or Phase 2 trial, pending FDA review.
 Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial for the Treatment of Platinum-Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
 In December 2018, we began treating patients in the Phase 1b portion of our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial combining AVB-S6-500 with standard-of-care therapies (specifically, paclitaxel (“Pac”), and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (“PLD”))
 in patients with platinum- resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. The decision to select platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer as our first indication was based upon the preclinical data that we had generated with AVB-S6-500 in platinum resistant ovarian cancer, the fact that platinum resistant ovarian tumors are highly AXL positive and the high unmet medical need for effective therapies to treat platinum resistant ovarian cancer.

Ovarian Cancer and Current Market Opportunity 
 Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common malignancy in women and is the leading cause of death among gynecological cancers.  According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that in 2019 there will be approximately 22,530 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed and approximately 13,980 ovarian cancer deaths in the United States. A woman’s risk of getting ovarian cancer during her lifetime is about 1 in 78. Her lifetime chance of dying from ovarian cancer is about 1 in 108. Ovarian cancer accounts for just 2.5% of all female cancer cases, but 5% of cancer deaths because of the disease’s low survival rate. Due to the nonspecific nature of disease symptoms, currently the majority of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, at which point their prognosis is poor. Improving the ability to detect ovarian cancer early is a research priority, given that women diagnosed with localized-stage disease have more than a 90% five-year survival rate.
 Current standard of care treatments for ovarian cancer include surgery and chemotherapy (cisplatin and carboplatin). The median progressive free survival rate for patients given standard of care (paclitaxel or doxil) to treat platinum- resistant recurrent ovarian cancer is 3-4 months with a median overall survival of 9-12 months.  Targeted therapies include bevacizumab (Avastin), and other drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, are being investigated as well. Drugs that inhibit the enzyme PARP-1 (called PARP inhibitors) have been approved for patients with ovarian cancer caused by mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 or as maintenance treatment following a platinum-based chemotherapy. New evidence shows that ovarian cancers can also become resistant to treatment with PARP inhibitors, and research is being conducted in the field to find ways to counteract this process. 
 Decision Resources Group in its July 2018 Ovarian Cancer Disease Landscape and Forecast estimates the ovarian cancer market to grow at an annual compound rate of 14% during the 2017-2027 period from approximately $1.4B to $5.3 billion in the seven major markets, which comprise the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan.
 Phase 1b portion of the Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial 
 The open-label, Phase 1b portion of the trial is expected to enroll up to 36 patients. The Phase 1b portion of the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial is designed, in part, to confirm the dosing regimen predicated on the Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers. The primary objective of the Phase 1b portion of the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of AVB-S6-500 in combination with Pac and PLD, and secondary objectives are to assess PK/PD (serum GAS6 levels), efficacy, and potential immunogenicity of AVB-S6-500.  Exploratory objectives include exploration of efficacy endpoints in biomarker (GAS6, AXL) defined populations based on expression of those biomarkers in serum and/or tumor tissue.  Initial safety data from the Phase 1b portion of a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial is expected in the third quarter of 2019.
 
5

Planned Phase 2 Portion of the Phase1b/2 Clinical Trial
 
The Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial is expected to enroll the first patient in the second half of 2019 and will be a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing AVB-S6-500 plus standard of care (PLD or Pac) to standard of care alone (placebo).  This Phase 2 portion is expected to enroll approximately 120 patients who will be randomized on a 2:1 basis to active arm versus placebo.  The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial is to assess anti-tumor activity of AVB-S6-500 in combination with Pac or PLD as a measure by progression free survival (PFS).  Secondary objectives include assessment of PK/PD and additional efficacy endpoints (objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR)). Topline data is expected at the end of 2020. Depending upon results, this clinical trial can be amended to include more patients to potentially become a pivotal trial after discussions with the FDA.

Second Oncology Indication-Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)
 In February 2019, we announced our plans to develop AVB-S6-500 in our second oncology indication, Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC). The decision to select ccRCC as our second indication was based upon the strong preclinical data that we had derived with AVB-S6-500 and the fact that AXL expression in primary tumors of ccRCC patients has been shown, in, third party studies as well as our own studies (Rankin et al, Direct regulation of GAS6/AXL signaling by HIF promotes renal metastasis through SRC and MET, PNAS September 16, 2014 vol. 111 no. 37 13373–13378), to correlate with aggressive tumor behaviors. We expect to initiate a phase 1b/2 clinical trial with AVB-S6-500 in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma in the second half of 2019. 
Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma and Current Market Opportunity
 Kidney cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and is among the 10 most common cancers in both men and women. Metastasis to distant organs including the lung, bone, liver and brain is the primary cause of death in kidney cancer patients as only 12% of metastatic kidney cancer will survive past 5 years.  According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that there will be approximately 73,820 new cases of kidney cancer (44,120 in men and 29,700 in women) and 14,770 people will die from this disease (9,820 men and 4,950 women) in 2019. 
 Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is a cancer of the kidney.  The name "clear cell" refers to the appearance of the cancer cells when viewed with a microscope. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma occurs when cells in the kidney quickly increase in number, creating a lump (mass).  Though the exact cause of clear cell renal cell carcinoma is unknown, smoking, the excessive use of certain medications, and genetic predisposition conditions, e.g. von Hippel Lindau syndrome which involves genetic mutation in VHL, a tumor suppressor gene controlling tumor initiation in ∼90% of ccRCC tumors, may contribute to the development of this type of cancer.  The primary function ascribed to VHL is the regulation of HIF protein stability. In VHL-deficient tumors, HIF transcriptional activity is constitutively active and contributes to both ccRCC tumor initiation and metastasis.  Reports have established a molecular link between HIF stabilization and AXL expression in metastatic ccRCC (Rankin et al, PNAS, September 16, 2014, vol. 111, no. 37,

The expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL in tumors has been postulated as a biomarker and increased mRNA levels of AXL is associated with poor differentiation grade and survival in renal cell cancer. (Gustafsson A, Martuszewska D, Johansson M, et al. Differential expression of AXL and Gas6 in renal cell carcinoma reﬂecting tumor advancement and survival. Clin Cancer Res 2009;15: 4742–9. Jul 15; Boysen G, Bausch-Fluck D, Thoma CR, et al. Identiﬁcation and functional characterization of pVHL-dependent cell surface proteins in renal cell carcinoma. Neoplasia 2012;14:535–46. Jun; Zhou L, Liu XD, Sun M, et al. Targeting MET and AXL overcomes resistance to sunitinib therapy in renal cell carcinoma. Oncogene, 2016 May; 35(21): 2687–2697. doi:10.1038/onc.2015.343.) 
 Treatment often begins with surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible, and may be followed by radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biological therapy, or targeted therapy. Most kidney cancer is chemotherapy and radiation resistant, resulting in a large unmet need for treatment therapies. 
 Non-Oncology Planned Trial-P2a IgA Nephropathy Trial
 In February 2019, we also announced our intent to develop AVB-S6-500 for potential use in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN).  IgAN is a nonsystemic renal disease that is characterized by predominant IgA deposition in the glomerular mesangium, causing mesangial proliferation and fibrosis.  IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritis and responsible for 10% of patients on dialysis affecting approximately 150,000-180,000 people in the United States.  IgAN is caused by IgA deposits in the kidneys, causing mesangial proliferation and fibrosis. Up to 50% of patients with IgAN develop end-stage renal disease and require dialysis within 20 years of diagnosis.  There is a high unmet medical need for treatment for IgAN as there are currently no therapies approved for treatment of IgAN.
 There are no approved drugs for the treatment of IgA nephropathy and a few therapies are currently in development.  Three current development programs target the complement pathway: Omeros Corporation is conducting a phase 3 clinical trial with an injectable MASP-2 inhibitor; Novartis AG is conducting a phase 2 clinical trial with their oral compound, LNP023; and Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is conducting a phase 2 clinical trial with APL2. Two other programs target B cell activity: EMD Serono Research & Development Institute, Inc. is testing Atacicept in a phase 2 clinical trial and Visterra Inc. is in the midst of testing VIS649in a phase I healthy volunteer clinical trial.  AVB-S6-500 has a mechanism of action unique from these other therapies.  
 GAS6 is a growth factor that causes proliferation of mesangial cells in the development of glomerulonephritis. GAS6 is upregulated in either endothelial/mesangial cells or podocytes in IgAN (Nagai K, Miyoshi M, Kake T, Fukushima N, Matsuura M, et al. (2013) Dual Involvement of Growth Arrest-Specific Gene 6 in the Early Phase of Human IgA Nephropathy. PLoS ONE 8(6): e66759. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066759). and expression in the diseased kidney tissue correlates with severity of IgA nephropathy (Nagai K, Miyoshi M, Kake T, Fukushima N, Matsuura M, et al. (2013) Dual Involvement of Growth Arrest-Specific Gene 6 in the Early Phase of Human IgANephropathy. PLoS ONE 8(6): e66759. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066759).  Preclinical data demonstrated that a lower affinity GAS6-trap improves fibrosis and proteinurea in experimental glomerulonephritis (Am J Pathol. 2001 Apr; 158(4): 1423–1432.doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64093-X).  Aravive has assessed serum levels in a small number of IgAN patients and found that they are elevated in comparison to age-matched subjects who do not have IgAN.  
 8

As currently discussed within the company, we believe the clinical trial with AVB-S6-500 in patients with IgAN will be a small open label clinical trial of 10-12 patients with IgAN treated for a 2 month period with 4 doses of AVB-S6-500. The primary objective of the clinical trial will be to evaluate the safety and tolerability of  AVB-S6-500 IV in IgAN patients. Secondary objectives will be to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IV AVB-S6-500 to ensure GAS6 levels are suppressed over the dosing interval.  The clinical trial will monitor proteinuria, hematuria and other renal functions and biopsies of patients will be taken before and after treatment to assess the effect on renal tissue and AXL activity. We intend, following discussions with FDA and allowance to proceed, to initiate a phase 1b clinical trial in the second half of 2019.

Other Indications
 We expect, subject to sufficient funding, to initiate additional clinical trials. Such additional clinical trials may involve combining AVB-S6-500 with standard of care in a number of tumor types, which may include in addition to ovarian cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, triple negative breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. We are also considering conducting studies in non-oncology indications such as kidney, lung or liver fibrosis in addition to the planned clinical trial with patients with IgAN.

GAS6-AXL Pathway
 
As illustrated in the following graphic, AXL receptor signaling plays an important role in multiple types of malignancies by promoting metastasis, cancer cell survival, resistance to treatments, and immune suppression.  
 

In preclinical studies, we have also identified high AXL expression on tumors resistant to the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy and that genetically inactivating AXL in tumors resistant to immunotherapy and radiotherapy restored anti-tumor immune response.
 In preclinical studies conducted in Dr. Giaccia’s laboratories at Stanford University, Dr. Giaccia was able to demonstrate that the immune response generated by loss of AXL leads to adaptive immune resistance through PD-L1 expression and Treg (regulatory T cells) infiltration. This resulted in tumors that became sensitive to checkpoint immunotherapy when they were previously resistant. Thus, GAS6-AXL pathway inhibitors, in combination with radiation or chemotherapy and immunotherapy, may be a promising treatment regimen and restore anti-tumor immune response.
 12

Aravive-S6 (AVB-S6)
 AVB-S6 is comprised of a family of novel, high-affinity, soluble Fc-fusion proteins designed to block the activation of the GAS6-AXL signaling pathway by intercepting GAS6 and interfering with its binding to its receptor AXL. AVB-S6 proteins have been engineered to have approximately 50 to 200 times greater affinity for human GAS6 compared to the native AXL receptor, effectively sequestering GAS6 and abrogating AXL signaling. We believe this ‘decoy receptor’ approach is well suited for AXL inhibition compared to small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors or antibodies, as illustrated by the following graphic.
 
Approaches to Inhibiting the GAS6/AXL Signaling


RTK - receptor tyrosine kinase
 mAb - monoclonal antibody
 
Preclinical Results
 
Our AVB-S6 proteins have been shown to bind GAS6 with higher affinity than the endogenous AXL protein and inhibit the GAS6/AXL signaling. Initial preclinical pharmacology studies were conducted with a variety of engineered AVB-S6 proteins. The preclinical program demonstrated that high GAS6 binding affinity was critical and correlative with the ability of AVB-S6 to inhibit metastasis and disease progression in vivo. AVB-S6 proteins have demonstrated significant efficacy in mouse models of metastatic ovarian, breast, renal, and pancreatic cancers.
 13

AVB-S6 proteins are selective for the AXL signaling pathway and demonstrate potent anti-metastatic activity in preclinical models. The following graphic indicates that AVB-S6 is selective for the AXL signaling pathway and is potent in a preclinical breast cancer lung metastasis model. The left panel shows western blot analysis of OVCAR8 (human platinum-resistant ovarian cancer) cells after 4-hour treatment with BGB324, foretinib, or AVB-S6. The right panel shows representative bioluminescent images of lung metastases in the 4T1 mouse model following treatment with vehicle (negative control), foretinib, BGB324 or AVB-S6.
 

Figure 4 of OVCAR8 JCI 2017 127(1) 183-195
 
The following graphic indicates that the affinity of AVB-S6 proteins relates to anti-metastatic effect in preclinical studies. The left panel shows the number of metastases from the peritoneum of OVCAR8 (human platinum-resistant ovarian cancer) mouse model following treatment with three AVB-S6 proteins having different affinity (330 fM, 10 pM and >2 nM). The right panel shows the total tumor weight from the peritoneum of OVCAR8 mouse model following treatment with the same three AVB-S6 proteins.
 

AVB-S6 proteins inhibit invasion and migration of highly invasive and metastatic cells, MDA-MB-231 and OVCAR8. In vivo studies with AVB-S6 proteins demonstrated significant reductions in metastatic tumor weight and number in platinum resistant ovarian (SKOV3.IP and OVCAR8) cancer models. In combination with the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (Dox), the anti-metastatic effect was greater, and 20-30% of the animals were tumor-free after the combination treatment in both platinum-resistant ovarian cancer studies.
 14

The following graphic indicates that AVB-S6 augments the efficacy of doxorubicin in a preclinical platinum resistant ovarian cancer model (SKOV3.IP).
 

Figure 6B from JCI 2017; (127)(1) 183-198
 
AVB-S6 proteins also demonstrated significant reductions in metastatic disease in triple negative breast (4T1), pancreatic (PDA1-1), and renal (SN12L1) cancer models. Additionally, in an orthotopic pancreatic model (LM-P) the AVB-S6 protein significantly increased survival in combination with the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine relative to gemcitabine or vehicle alone. The combination studies also demonstrated a relationship between AXL signaling and the cellular response to DNA damage in breast, pancreatic and ovarian cancer models. This relationship was even more pronounced in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapies such as doxorubicin and gemcitabine.
 Notably, treatment with the AVB-S6 protein alone or in combination with gemcitabine demonstrated a significant decrease in tumor fibrosis. Decreasing fibrosis in the tumor microenvironment may increase efficacy of co-administered chemotherapeutics and potentially immuno-therapeutics by allowing greater access of T cells to the tumor cells. Once the development candidate, AVB-S6-500, was selected, in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies were conducted to demonstrate that AVB-S6-500 had the same biological activity as the other AVB-S6 proteins.
 Biomarker
 GAS6 expression in tumors has been reported to be an adverse prognostic factor in several cancers, including urothelial, ovarian, lung adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, glioblastoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, liver carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. In studies conducted by us, AVB-S6proteins bind GAS6 with higher affinity than the endogenous AXL protein and prevent GAS6 signaling at the AXL receptor. Preclinical efficacy data for the AVB-S6 program demonstrated a relationship between reduced serum GAS6 and an anti-metastatic effect. We have developed an assay designed to measure GAS6 levels in the blood before and after dosing of Our development candidate. In the presence of a pharmacologically active dose of AVB-S6, serum GAS6 has not been detectable. Thus, GAS6 levels in the blood of patients may be a pharmacodynamic biomarker that can aid AVB-S6 dose selection and potentially serve as a predictive biomarker for response to treatment with AVB-S6.

The following graphic indicates the relationship between AVB-S6-500 protein levels and GAS6 levels in blood from humans participating in the AVB-S6-500 first in human trial.

Manufacturing 
 Manufacturing of our clinical trial material consists of three main phases, the production of bulk protein (drug substance), formulation/filling operations, and labelling/packaging operations of the finished product. The protein has been manufactured at high yield and with high purity. The clinical bulk drug substance is produced using industry standard manufacturing processes, as is the drug product.
 Since September 2017, we have relied on a third party contract manufacturer to manufacture clinical bulk drug substance and drug product of AVB-S6-500 using a cell line and process developed by our contract manufacturer that has been licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis. We have manufactured enough AVB-S6-500 to dose approximately 400 patients for a six-month period, which is expected to be sufficient to complete the planned Phase 1b/Phase 2 ovarian cancer trial. The clinical bulk drug substance and drug product is manufactured pursuant to the terms of a five year Master Manufacturing Services Agreement that we entered into with our contract manufacturer in July 2016, which agreement automatically renews for successive one (1) year periods, unless either party provides written notice to the other party of its desire not to renew at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.  The Master Manufacturing Services Agreement is terminable by us upon 45 days prior written notice, by our contract manufacturer Limited upon 190 days prior written notice provided that all statements of work in progress at such time are completed and upon 60 days prior written notice upon a breach of the terms of the agreement if such breach is not cured within such 60 day period.  
 We have also contracted with an independent third party located in Texas for the labeling, packaging, and distribution of our injectable protein.
 Our personnel have significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality and project management experience to execute and manage manufacturing process development, plus oversee the manufacture, testing, quality release, storage and distribution of drug products according to the current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMPs, promulgated by the FDA and other regulatory requirements. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to the organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. Our facilities, and our third-party manufacturers, may be subject to periodic inspections by FDA and local authorities, which include, but are not limited to procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our biological drug candidates to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, and consent decrees causing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations plus causing possible civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of its biological drug candidates. Similar to contract manufacturers, we may encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.
 Research and Development
 We have made and will continue to make substantial investments in research and development. Our research and development expenses totaled $11.1 million and $94.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 16

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties, such as clinical research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct clinical trials and aspects of research and preclinical testing. These third parties provide project management and monitoring services and regulatory consulting and investigative services.
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. We face competition from many different sources, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies, as well as public and private research institutions. Any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing products and therapies as well as new products and therapies that may become available in the future.
 At this time, there are no FDA- or European Medicines Agency-approved therapies targeting GAS6. We believe this mechanism of action represents a novel approach to inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis, as well as addressing tumor immune evasion and resistance to other anticancer agents. Exelixis, Inc. markets cabozantinib, the only currently marketed AXL inhibitor. We are aware of a number of companies focused on developing AXL inhibitors in various indications, including BerGenBio ASA, Astellas Pharma Inc., Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., Les Laboratoires Servier, SAS, Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ignyta, Inc., as well as several companies addressing AXL inhibitors, and PARP 1/2 inhibitors and related signaling pathways.
 Our competition may also include companies that are or will be developing therapies for the same therapeutic areas that we are targeting, including ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, and liver fibrosis. Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners may have substantially greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personal, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, and in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for our programs.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that it may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before it is able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
 License Agreement
 In 2012, Private Aravive entered into an exclusive license agreement with Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford University, for intellectual and tangible property rights relating to biologic inhibitors for therapeutic targeting the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL. The license agreement was amended in 2012, 2015 and 2017 to modify certain of the stated milestones and expand the patent rights granted to Private Aravive. The term of the license is the length of the last to expire patent. The license agreement grants Private Aravive exclusive, worldwide rights to make, use or sell licensed materials based upon the following patent-related rights:

As consideration for the rights granted in the license agreement, Private Aravive is obligated to pay Stanford University yearly license fees and milestone payments, and a royalty based on net sales of products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. More specifically, Private Aravive is obligated to pay Stanford University (i) annual license payments, (ii) milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $1,000,000 upon achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones, and (iii) royalties equal to a percentage (in the low single digits) of net sales of licensed products; provided that the annual license payments made will offset (and be credited against) any royalties due in such license year. In the event of a sublicense to a third party of any rights based on the patents that are solely owned by Stanford University, Private Aravive is obligated to pay royalties to Stanford University equal to a percentage of what Private Aravive would have been required to pay to Stanford University had it sold the products under sublicense itself. In addition, in such event Private Aravive is required to pay to Stanford University a percent of sublicensing income. The license agreement may be terminated by Stanford University upon 30 days written notice if Private Aravive breaches its obligations thereunder, including failing to make any milestone or other required payments or to exercise diligence to bring licensed products to market. In the event of a termination, Private Aravive will be obligated to pay all amounts that accrued prior to such termination. The license agreement also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia, including the licensee’s agreement to indemnify Stanford University for any liabilities arising out of or related to the licensee’s exercise of its rights under, or breach of, the license agreement, the reservation of the licensor of the right to use the licensed intellectual property rights for its internal, non-commercial purposes, limitations/disclaimers of various warranties.
 CPRIT Grant
 In 2016, Private Aravive was approved for a $20.0 million grant, or the CPRIT Grant, from CPRIT for development of AVB-S6. The CPRIT Grant is subject to customary CPRIT funding conditions including a matching funds requirement whereby Private Aravive was required to match $0.50 for every $1.00 from CPRIT. Consequently, Private Aravive was required to raise $10.0 million in matching funds, and it has raised $11.4 million since 2016. The grant award, as is customary for all CPRIT awards, contains a requirement that Private Aravive pay CPRIT a tiered royalty on sales of commercial products developed using CPRIT funds equal to a low- to mid-single digit percentage of revenue until such time as CPRIT has been paid an aggregate amount equal to 400% of the grant award proceeds. After 400% of the grant award proceeds has been paid, Private Aravive Biologics will be obligated to pay CPRIT a royalty of less than one percent for as long as Private Aravive maintains government exclusivity. The CPRIT Grant contract terminates on May 31, 2019, unless extended with CPRIT’s approval. After the termination date, we are not permitted to retain any unused grant award proceeds without CPRIT’s approval, but our royalty and other obligations, including our obligation to repay the disbursed grant proceeds under certain circumstances, survive the termination of the agreement. We have received $18.0 million of the grant award proceeds and expect to expend all of the grant award proceeds by the agreement termination date. We expect to receive the remaining $2.0 million grant award as reimbursement of future expenses once we have expended the $18.0 million of grant award proceeds already received.
 The CPRIT Grant is subject to us complying with all terms set forth in the CPRIT Grant, including maintaining our status with CPRIT as a Texas-based entity. In order to qualify as a Texas-based entity, a company must fulfill a majority of the following seven requirements: (i) its US headquarters must be physically located in Texas; (ii) its chief executive officer must reside in Texas; (iii) a majority of its personnel, including at least two other senior-level employees, must reside in Texas; (iv) its manufacturing activities must take place in Texas; (v) at least 90% of its grant award funds must be paid to individuals and entities in Texas, including salaries and personnel costs for employees and contractors: (vi) at least one clinical trial site must be in Texas; and (vii) it must collaborate with a medical research organization in Texas, including a public or private institution of higher education. Currently, we meet a majority of these seven requirements.
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our technology and know-how to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of targeting the GAS6-AXL pathway for the identification and development of therapeutic candidates for cancer therapy and fibrosis. In addition, we rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. We also utilize trademark protection for our company name, and expect to do so for products and/or services as they are marketed.
 Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our therapeutic candidates may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
 18

Our patent position with respect to the GAS6-AXL program is comprised of six patent portfolios containing composition of matter claims relating to novel GAS6-binding fusion proteins, and claims to the use of our novel fusion proteins for the treatment of various oncological conditions, as well as antiviral and antifibrotic disorders. Our license agreement with Stanford University provides us with exclusive rights to intellectual property, or IP, that is either solely owned by Stanford (Portfolio I below) or co-owned by Stanford and us (Portfolios II, III, and V below). We also have rights to IP that we solely own (Portfolio IV and VI below)
 As of February 28, 2019, we have exclusive rights to more than 10 issued patents and 9 pending patent applications that are solely owned by Stanford University and licensed to us. The expiration date for those patents/patent applications is 2031. We also have exclusive rights to 5 issued patents and more than 10 pending applications that are jointly owned with Stanford University and are also subject to the license agreement with Stanford. The expiration dates for those patents/patent applications range from 2033-2035. We have one issued patent and two pending patents that we solely own. The expiration dates for those patents range from 2035-2038. Additional details on our relevant portfolios is provided below:
 
 
• | Portfolio I— “Inhibition of AXL Signaling in Anti-Metastatic Therapy” More than 10 Granted Patents in the United States, Australia, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, Russia, and South Africa—9 Pending Applications in United States, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, and South Korea.

• | Portfolio V— “Antifibrotic Activity of GAS6 Inhibitor” 5 Pending Applications in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, and Hong Kong.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Portfolio VI— “Methods of Treating Metastatic Cancers Using Axl Decoy Receptors” 1 Pending Application in the United States.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

In the future, we expect to continue prosecuting broader coverage of certain composition of matter applications. Additionally, we will seek to file new patents related to novel candidates, manufacturing, clinical formulations, dose, and indications, as well as evaluate the acquisition of other innovative IP.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
 The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering its therapeutics candidates and their methods of use.
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these procedures, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Government Regulation 
 Federal, state and local government authorities in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological and pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Drug Approval Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND or Investigational New Drug which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that meets applicable requirements to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the product that is the subject of the BLA based on results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced, to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 
Before testing any biological development candidate in humans, the candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
 20

Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations composing the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
 
• | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the targeted disease.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 21

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee on approved biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. No user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a Fast Track biological product, the FDA may consider review of completed sections of a BLA on a rolling basis provided the sponsor provides, and the FDA accepts, a schedule for the submission of the completed sections of the BLA. Under these circumstances, the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. A Fast Track designated drug candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA reviews the BLA in a total of six months rather than ten months after it is accepted for filing. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
 Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
 22

Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as ‘off-label’ use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
 In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and similar state laws, each as amended.
 The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The anti-kickback statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the anti-kickback statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services 
 23

resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act., as discussed below.
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal civil False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services; making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim; or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, if approved, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct business. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and their respective implementing regulations, .  imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouse, that create, receive, or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, some of which are more stringent and many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.
 Additionally, the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, (with certain exceptions), to annually  report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, or CMS, information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties. of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.

In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business. 
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to that third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost- effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect the pressure on healthcare pricing will continue to increase. Coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 25


In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. Among other things, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inserverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The Texas District Court Judge, as well as the Trump Administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the Texas District Court Judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. It is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act.
 Congress also could consider additional legislation to repeal, replace, or further modify elements of the ACA. Thus, the full impact of the ACA, or any law replacing elements of it, and the political uncertainty regarding any repeal and replacement on the ACA, on our business remains unclear. Many of the details regarding the implementation of the ACA are yet to be determined, and at this time, it remains unclear the full effect that the ACA would have on our business. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to the ACA, and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue in the future.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. Additionally, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
 We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
 We anticipate that current and future U.S. legislative healthcare reforms may result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
 Foreign Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, it would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

European Data Collection
 The collection and use of personal health data in the European Economic Area (EEA) is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (or GDPR), which became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EU or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EU. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data (including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements) and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to 20 million Euros or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim material and non material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR, will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
