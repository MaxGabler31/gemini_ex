Products and Market
 
Through our indirect subsidiaries in the PRC, we are currently engaged in the production and sale of (1) fruit juice concentrates (including fruit purees, concentrated fruit purees and concentrated fruit juices); (2) fruit beverages (including fruit juice beverages and fruit cider beverages); and (3) other fruit-related products (including primarily organic and non-organic fresh fruits, dried fruit, preserved fruit, fructose) in and from the PRC.
 
In 2017, sales of our fruit concentrates, fruit beverages, and other fruit related products represented 30%, 69%, and 1% of our revenue, respectively, compared to 51%, 43%, and 6%, respectively, in 2016.
 
Our Huludao Wonder operation, a subsidiary which produces concentrated apple juice, suffered continued operating losses in the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and the cash flows were minimal during the same three fiscal years. Thus, in December 2016, we established a restructuring plan to close Huludao Wonder Operation. In fiscal years of 2017 and 2016, this discontinued operation reported a loss of $11.52 million and $4.79 million, respectively.
 
In the management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operations, for the basis of comparison, the amounts used in comparison have been reclassified to exclude the amounts from discontinued operations, which have been discussed as a separate line item listed on the statement of income.
 
Specialty fruit juices, or “small breed” fruit juices, are juices squeezed from fruits that are grown in relatively small quantities such as kiwi juice, mulberry juice, turnjujube juice and pomegranate juice. Currently, our specialty juice beverage offerings include pear juice, kiwi juice and mulberry juice. At the end of 2017, we possessed 21 patents and proprietary technologies in the processing technology of specialty fruit juice and gained a number of honors and qualifications in the fruit juice industry.

Competitive Advantages
 
We believe our competitive advantages include the modern equipment and technology employed at our production factories in Shaanxi Province and the strategic locations of our manufacturing facilities. Our equipment and technology help us to ensure product quality, control costs and allow us to meet international fruit juice production standards such as ISO9001, HACCP, and Kosher certifications, and those imposed by the United States Food and Drug Administration. In addition, our manufacturing facilities are strategically located near regional fruit production centers. For example, Shaanxi Province, where two of our manufacturing facilities are located, is known in the PRC for pear and kiwi production. Our orange manufacturing facilities are located in Hubei Province, which is a strong region of production for oranges. Our proximity to regional fruit production centers enables us to purchase fresh fruits directly from farmers, avoid the need of transporting fresh fruit over long distances to processing facilities, reduce our transportation expenses and damage to fresh fruit during transportation and helps us maintain high quality of finished products by preserving freshness.
 
We own and operate four manufacturing facilities in the PRC. To take advantage of economies of scale and to enhance our production efficiency, each of our manufacturing facilities focuses on juice products centering around one particular fruit based on the proximity of each facility to the supply center of that fruit. All concentrated juice products are manufactured using the same type of production line with slight variations in processing methods. We operate our pear juice products business out of our Foods Industry Jingyang. Our business involving apple juice products is operated out of Huludao Wonder and Yingkou, and our business involving kiwi products is operated out of Shaanxi Qiyiwangguo, in which we have held a 91.15% ownership interest since June 2006. As our Huludao Wonder operation suffered continued operating losses in the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and the cash flows were minimal during the same three fiscal years, in December 2016, we established a restructuring plan to close Hudludao Wonder Operation. 
 
Corporate History
 
We were initially incorporated in 1998 in Florida as Cyber Public Relations, Inc. for the purpose of providing internet electronic commerce consulting services to small and medium sized businesses and did not have any material operations or revenue. On January 21, 2004, we purchased all of the outstanding share capital of Environmental Technologies, Inc., (“Environmental Technologies”), a Nevada corporation, in exchange for approximately 29,051 shares of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”). As a result, Environmental Technologies became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the Environmental Technologies shareholders acquired approximately 97% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock, and we changed our name to Entech Environmental Technologies, Inc.
 
After our acquisition of Environmental Technologies, we operated through our wholly-owned subsidiary, H.B. Covey, Inc. (“H.B. Covey”), a business providing construction and maintenance services to petroleum service stations in the southwestern part of the United States and installation services for consumer home products in Southern California. In July 2007, we entered into and consummated a Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we sold H.B. Covey.
 
We were a shell company with no significant business operations after we sold H.B. Covey. As a result of the consummation of a reverse merger transaction, on February 26, 2008 we ceased being a shell company and became an indirect holding company for SkyPeople (China) through Pacific Industry Holdings Group Co., Ltd. (“Pacific”). Pacific was incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Vanuatu, and was a holding company for our operating subsidiary, SkyPeople (China). We closed Pacific in the second quarter of 2017. In May 2008, we changed our name to SkyPeople Fruit Juice, Inc.
 
On June 10, 2008, we acquired Huludao Wonder from Shaanxi Hede Investment Management Co., Ltd., (“Hede”), for a total purchase price of RMB 48,250,000, or approximately $6,308,591, based on the exchange rate on June 1, 2007. The payment was made through the offset of related party receivables.

On March 13, 2018, the Company held a Special Meeting of shareholders, and the shareholders approved an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the “Articles Amendment”), which increased the amount of authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company from 8,333,333 to 60,000,000, as well as the Share Payment.
 
In connection with the Acquisition Agreements and to provide funding for their consummation, on November 3, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with Mr. Zeyao Xue (“Xue”) pursuant to which Future FinTech agreed to sell 11,362,159 shares of its common stock (the “Shares”) to Xue for an aggregate purchase price of $16,437,248.50. The per share price for the Shares was determined using the average closing price quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market for the common stock of the Company over the three (3) trading days prior to the date of the Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Price”). Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Purchase Price may be adjusted upward if, on the third business day following the later of (i) the public disclosure of the execution of the Acquisition Agreements and (ii) the Company’s filing of its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 (in each case, counting the date of disclosure as the first such day, provided that the applicable public disclosure is made prior to the close of trading on such date), the per share closing price of the Company’s common stock quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market (the “Disclosure Price”) is higher than the Purchase Price, in which case the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to the Disclosure Price (the “Adjusted Price”), and Xue shall pay to the Future FinTech an amount equal to (x) the difference between the Purchase Price and the Adjusted Price (y) multiplied by the number of Shares (the “Additional Amount”). If the Disclosure Price is lower than Purchase Price, no adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made. The consummation of the Share Purchase Agreement was contingent on Future FinTech receiving shareholder approval at a Special Shareholders Meeting for the Articles Amendment and the approval of Shares issuance under the Share Purchase Agreement by the shareholders of the Company. At the Special Meeting of shareholders held on March 13, 2018, and the shareholders approved the Articles Amendment and the consummation of the Share Purchase Agreement.

Principal Products
 
There are two general categories of fruit and vegetable juices available in the market. One is fresh juice that is canned directly upon filtering and sterilization after being squeezed out of fresh fruits or vegetables. The other general category is juice drinks made out of concentrated fruit and vegetable juices. Concentrated fruit and vegetable juices are produced through the pressing, filtering, sterilization and evaporation of fresh fruits or vegetables. Concentrated juices are not drinkable. Instead, they are used as a basic ingredient for manufacturing juice drinks and as an additive to fruit wine, fruit jam, cosmetics and medicines.
 
Our core products are (1) fruit juice concentrates, mainly including concentrated apple, pear, and kiwi juices; (2) fruit beverages, including pure fruit beverages and fruit cider beverages; and (3) other fruit-related products, including, for example, fresh fruits, vegetables and fructose.
 
Fruit Juice Concentrate
 
Our family of fruit juice concentrate products mainly includes concentrated apple, pear, and kiwi juices. Fruit juice concentrates can only be produced during the “squeezing season” of a year, when fresh fruits are available in the market. Generally, the squeezing season for apples is from August through January or February of the following year, the squeezing season for pears is from July or August through April of the following year, and the squeezing season for kiwifruits is from September through December or January of the following year.
 
Fruit juice concentrates are manufactured through a multi-stage process, which includes pressing, filtering, sterilizing and evaporating fresh fruits and fruit juices.
 
Fruit juice concentrates are used as the base ingredient in fruit juice beverages and are also used in other products such as ice cream, fruit wine and, to a lesser extent, cosmetics and medicine.
 
We currently sell apple, pear, and kiwifruit concentrates. Our fruit juice concentrate products include concentrated apple and pear juice. Our concentrated kiwifruits are made of three different categories: kiwifruit puree, concentrated kiwifruit puree and concentrated kiwifruit juice.
 
Kiwifruit puree is prepared from clean, sound kiwifruits that have been washed and sorted prior to processing. The kiwifruits are crushed and pressed and the pulp of the kiwifruit is kept. All of the water and some of the pulp are then removed from the kiwifruit puree and the sugar level is increased in order to produce concentrated kiwifruit puree. We use advanced technologies to maintain the natural flavors and nutrients of the kiwifruit puree. Kiwifruit puree and concentrated kiwifruit puree are ideal raw materials used in the production of concentrated kiwifruit juices, kiwifruit beverages, kiwifruit flavored ice creams, smoothies and health care products. Concentrated kiwifruit juice is made from concentrated kiwifruit puree by removing all of the remaining pulp. 
 
Our production line at the Shaanxi Qiyiwangguo factory can only produce puree and concentrated puree. We use the production line that produces concentrated apple and pear juice in the facility of the Jingyang branch of SkyPeople (China) to produce concentrated clear kiwifruit juice.

Concentrated apple juice and concentrated pear juice are prepared from fresh fruits. Fruit juice concentrates can also be combined with other fruit juices for the production of blended fruit juices, canned foods, confectionaries, fruit cider beverages and other beverage products.
 
Fruit Juice Beverages

As compared to our fruit juice concentrate products, which experience seasonality, fruit juice beverages can be produced and sold year-round. We plan to focus on developing new beverages with higher margins.
 
The manufacturing process for fruit juice beverages involves further processing of fruit juice concentrates. Our fruit juice beverages are divided into two categories: pure fruit juice and fruit cider beverages. The gross margins for our fruit beverages were 20% and 34% in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Currently we produce five flavors of fruit beverages in 236 ml glass bottles, 258 ml glass bottles, 280 ml glass bottles, 418 ml glass and 500 ml glass bottles, 888 ml glass bottles, 1.21 L glass bottles and BIB (bag in box) packages, including kiwifruit juice, mulberry juice, peach juice, pomegranate juice and fruit and vegetable juice. We also produce two flavors of lactobacillus fruit beverages in 268 ml glass bottles, including lactobacillus kiwifruit juice and lactobacillus mulberry juice, as well as three beverages with rich dietary fiber in 330 ml glass bottles, including kumquat and grapefruit juice, kiwifruit juice and mulberry juice. We currently sell our fruit beverages to over 100 distributors and more than 20,000 retail stores in approximately 20 provinces. Our products are sold through distributors in stores such as Hualian Supermarket in Beijing, RT-Mart in Shenyang, WOWO in Chengdu, the Quanjia convenient store chain, Vanguard in Xi’an, Carrefour in Chongqing and Shenyang and Lianhua Supermarket in Shanghai.
 
Other Products
 
We also generally sell fresh fruits and vegetables, fructose and other products. 
 
The fruit processing capacity of our fructose production line is 10 tons of fresh apples or pears per hour. Fructose is often used as an ingredient to make beverages and other food products. Although we currently plan to use the new fructose production line to produce pear fructose, this production may also be used to produce apple fructose from apple juice concentrates.
 
The gross margin for our other fruit-related products was 25% and 19% in fiscal year 2017 and 2016, respectively. Given the relatively low amount of production and sales of other products, their gross margin is expected to be unstable.  
 
On September 20, 2017, GlobalKey Supply Chain Ltd. (“GlobalKey”), a limited liability company incorporated in China and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Xi’an Hedetang Nutritious Food Research Co. Ltd., (“Nutritious Food”), entered into a License Agreement of Sales Agent and Platform of IB-LIVE (the “Agreement”) with Shaanxi Entai Bio-Technology Co. Ltd, a limited liability company incorporated in China (“Shaanxi Entai”).
 
Under the Agreement, Shaanxi Entai appointed Nutritious Food as its sole global agent of Shaanxi Entai’s IB-LIVE series of products, a new generation of nutritious and healthy products for improving male sexual health. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, GlobalKey shall be the sole global general distributor and operating platform of the IB-LIVE products, and shall be responsible for actual product marketing and promotion, the identification and development of sales channels, and similar business activities in relation to its worldwide sale of IB-LIVE products to distributors. During the term of the Agreement, GlobalKey must meet certain monthly sales targets, which such completion will be evaluated on a quarterly basis. The failure to meet at least 70% of the sales volume of such targets will authorize Shaanxi Entai to reduce the authorized areas of GlobalKey’s distribution or terminate the license with GlobalKey. In the event that GlobalKey fails to take scheduled deliveries of the IB-LIVE products for two consecutive months, GlobalKey will be deemed to have waived its sales management rights under the Agreement. Nutritious Food and GlobalKey shall pay deposits to Shaanxi Entai in the amounts of RMB5,000,000 and RMB 10,000,000, respectively (approximately $759,414 and $1,518,818, respectively) within the first year of the Agreement as a security deposit. We expect to receive the deposits in September 2018.

Industry and Principal Markets
 
Global Market
 
The fruit juice processing industry is an emerging industry in the PRC. Consumption of fruit juice beverages has grown and sales have increased rapidly in recent years due to the increasing health consciousness of consumers and the natural and healthy qualities of fruit juice beverages. According to Information Management Research Centre, the global market for fruit juice and nectars has grown at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of around 1.6% during the period between 2009 and 2016, reaching a volume of 43.6 billion litres in 2016.
 
In the past ten years, the quantity and revenue of exported concentrated apple juice from China has continued to drop. In 2007, China exported 1.031 million tons of concentrated apple juice with a value of $1.233 billion, which accounted for 51.2% of the world total. In 2016, China exported only 506,563 tons of concentrated apple juice with a value of $0.546 billion. In 2016, the revenue of concentrated apply juice exported from China reduced by 2.55% compared with the previous year, and the volume of concentrated apply juice exported from China reduced by 6.91% compared with the previous year. The reduction of exported concentrated apple juice from China is mainly due to heavy competition in Europe. However, in 2017, due to lower material costs in China, the exported concentrated apple juice from China increased to 660,000 tons, an increase of 29.2% as compared to 2016, and the unit price reduced by 5.1% as compared to 2016.
 
The PRC Market
 
The PRC has the world’s largest population, but the consumption of fruit juice beverages is relatively low. According to the report “China Fruit Juice Beverages Business and Market Analysis” published by the PRC Food and Agriculture Export Association, www.Chinajuice.org, the annual per capita consumption of fruit beverages in the PRC in 2009 was approximately 1 kilogram, which accounted for only 13% of the average world per capita consumption and 4% of the average per capita consumption in industrialized countries. In 2010, Chinese fruit juice production reached 17 million tons, an increase of 20.6% compared to 2009. In 2016, fruit juice consumption was RMB100.9 billion, an increase of 1.88% as compared to the previous year. We believe that the increasing health consciousness of consumers and the quality of living powered by the PRC’s economic growth will continue to fuel the demand for our fruit juice products. However, the production of fruit juice in China reduced by 4.78% in 2016 as compared to 2015, which was largely the result of an increase in imported fruit juice and heavy competition in China consumer market.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
 
We market our products through three primary methods: direct contact with foreign businesses, attendance at international exhibitions and sales made through trade websites. Our marketing and sales teams work closely together to maintain a consistent message to our customers.
 
The sales team is divided into three subdivisions, focusing on the sales of fruit juice concentrates, fruit beverage products and derivative products, respectively.
 
We sell our fruit juice concentrates both domestically and internationally, while we have only sold our fruit beverages domestically. We sell our products either indirectly through distributors with good credit history or directly to end-users.
 
12

 

Our export business is primarily comprised of fruit juice concentrates. The export of our fruit juice concentrates is handled internally by our international trade department, which has 6 employees.
 
The North American and European markets represent a large portion of apple and pear concentrate consumption. The U.S. market is a highly mature market with stable growth for apple concentrate. The European market has been a target market since our inception. Apple concentrate is used to produce many beverages and wines consumed by Europeans. The Middle East is also a target market for our apple juice concentrate. Our sales of concentrated apple and pear juice in these markets have declined in the past few years, mainly due to the heavy competition in the international market.
 
The Chinese market drives our fruit beverage sales, with most beverages sold through provincial, city and county-level agents. We also sell directly to hotels, supermarkets and similar outlets in smaller quantities. Our fruit beverage sales are carried out by a team of 56 employees. Historically, we have only sold our fruit beverages regionally in Shaanxi Province and some neighboring cities in the PRC. We currently sell our fruit beverages to over 100 distributors and more than 20,000 retail stores in approximately 20 provinces. 
 
Our kiwifruit products are targeted at the European, Southeast Asian, South Korean, Japanese, Middle Eastern, Mainland Chinese and Taiwanese markets. The growth of our kiwifruit concentrate and kiwifruit beverages has exceeded the growth rate of any other product we offer. 
 
Competition
 
The markets in which we operate are competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to shifting customer demands and expectations. We believe that a number of companies are producing products that compete directly with our product offerings and some of our competitors have significantly more financial resources than we possess.
Our apple juice concentrate competitors include Sdic Zhounglu Fruit Juice Co., Ltd., Yantai North Andre (Group) Juice Co., Ltd., Shaanxi Hengxing Fruit Juice and Shaanxi Haisheng Juice Holdings Co., Ltd. We also compete with fruit juice companies such as Wahaha, Huiyuan, Nongfu Guoyuan, Tongyi and Meizhiyuan.
 
We believe our competitive advantages include our modern equipment and our proprietary processes for the production of specialty fruit juices or small breed fruit juices. Among the twenty one proprietary technologies, we have obtained ten design patents, nine invention patents for production and two Utility Model Patents for equipment. Our current specialty fruit juice offering includes kiwifruit and mulberry related juice products. We also have technologies to produce concentrated persimmon, turnjujube, apricot, cherry, cherry tomato, sea-buckthorn, strawberry and wolfberry juices. Our technology allows us to develop and produce beverages, such as our new mulberry and kiwifruit cider beverages, which we introduced in the Chinese market in the first quarter of 2009. Our research indicates that these new beverages have higher gross margins than that of the industry average. 
 
We believe the proximity of our manufacturing facilities to fruit farms is also one of our competitive advantages. It allows us to purchase fruit directly from fruit farmers, avoid the need for long distance transportation, minimize damages to the fruits and maximize the freshness of the fruits.
 
We produce fruit beverages from our fruit juice concentrates, which allows us to better control the quality of our beverages.
 
Raw Materials and Other Supplies
 
Fresh fruits, including apples, pears and kiwifruits are the primary raw materials for our products. The continuous supply of high quality fresh fruit is necessary for our current operations and our future business growth.
 
The PRC has the largest planting area of kiwifruit and apples in the world. Shaanxi Province, the location of two of our factories, has the largest planting area of kiwifruit and apples in the PRC. According to “Statistical Bulletin of Development of Fruit Industry in Shaanxi Province 2010,” in 2010, the kiwifruit planting area in Shaanxi Province was over 114,226 acres. In 2015, the kiwifruit planting area in Shaanxi Province was about 164,737 acres, with an output of 12.3 million tons, which is 20% of the world output and 33% of China’s total output. In 2016, the production of kiwifruit was 1.31 million tons, an increase of 5.5% as compared to the previous year. Pomegranate, strawberry, peach and cherry yields are also high in Shaanxi Province. Liaoning Province in the PRC, the location of our Huludao Wonder and Yingkou factories, abounds with high acidity apples. Other raw materials used in our business include pectic enzyme, amylase, auxiliary power fuels and other power sources such as coal, electricity and water.

We purchase raw materials from local markets and fruit growers that deliver directly to our plants. We have implemented a fruit purchasing program in areas surrounding our factories. In addition, we organize purchasing centers in rich fruit production areas, helping farmers deliver fruit to our purchasing agents easily and in a timely manner. We are then able to deliver the fruit directly to our factory for production. We have assisted local farmers in their development of kiwifruit fields to help ensure a high quality product throughout the production channel. Our raw material supply chain is highly fragmented and raw fruit prices are highly volatile.
 
Shaanxi Province is a large agricultural and fruit producing province with sufficient resources to satisfy our raw material needs. Shaanxi Province is also the main pear-producing province in the PRC and its pear supply can generally meet our production requirements. Liaoning Province, the PRC’s center for high acidity apples, can generally supply enough apples to meet our Liaoning Province factory’s production needs.
 
In addition to raw materials, we purchase various ingredients and packaging materials such as sweeteners, glass and plastic bottles, cans and packing barrels. We generally purchase our materials or supplies from multiple suppliers. We are not dependent on any one supplier or group of suppliers.
 
On August 3, 2016, Shaanxi Guoweimei Kiwi Deep Processing Company, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, signed a lease agreement for 20,000 mu (approximately 3,300 square acres) of kiwifruits orchard located in Mei County, Shaanxi Province, with the Di’erpo Committe of Jinqu Village, Mei County, Shaanxi for a term of 30 years, from August 5, 2016 to August 4, 2046. On August 15, 2016, Hedetang Agricultural Plantations (Yidu) Co., Ltd., an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, signed a lease agreement for 8000 mu (approximately 1,320 square acres) of orange orchard located in the city of Yidu, Hubei Province, with the Yidu Sichang Farmers Association, Hubei Province, for a term of 20 years, from September 22, 2016 to September 21, 2036. The Company believes that the leasing of the orchards will help ensure the quality and safety of its products and lower its costs.
 
Seasonality
 
We can only produce fruit juice concentrates during the squeezing season generally from July or August through April of the following year, while our fruit juice beverages can be produced year round. Annual capacity of our production lines varies based on the availability of the fresh fruit and is ultimately contingent on weather and other climatic conditions leading up to and through the harvest seasons. As a result, our fruit juice business is highly seasonal as sales of our products are generally higher during the squeezing season. Sales of our products during the months from March through July, or the non-squeezing season, generally tend to be lower due to a shortage of fresh fruit and a lower level of production activity. As such, our results of operations for the first and fourth quarters are generally stronger than those for our second and third quarters. We can produce fruit juice beverages year round.
 
We plan to broaden our fruit product offerings to expand into fruits with harvesting seasons complementary to our current fruits. This will enable us to lengthen our squeezing season, thus increasing our annual production of fruit concentrate and fruit juice beverages.
 
Government Regulation

Our products are subject to central government regulation as well as provincial government regulation in Shaanxi, Hubei and Liaoning Provinces. Business and product licenses must be obtained through application to the central, provincial and local governments. We have obtained our business licenses to operate domestically and export products under the laws and regulations of the PRC. We obtained business licenses to conduct businesses, including an operating license to sell packaged foods such as concentrated fruit and vegetable juices, fruit sugar, fruit pectin, frozen and freeze dried fruits and vegetables, dehydrated fruits and vegetables, fruit and vegetable juice drinks, fruit cider and organic food. Business, company and product registrations are certified on a regular basis and we must comply with the laws and regulations of the PRC, provincial and local governments and industry agencies.
 
14

 

In accordance with PRC laws and regulations, we are required to comply with applicable hygiene and food safety standards in relation to our production processes. Failure to pass these inspections, or the loss of or failure to renew our licenses and permits, could require us to temporarily or permanently suspend some or all of our production activities, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.
 
Chinese government recently tightened environment regulations, the Company is in the process of adapting the new standards and lots of our construction projects have been delayed.

We believe that our continued success and competitive status depend largely on our proprietary technology and ability to innovate. We have taken the required measures to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary technologies and processes. We rely on a combination of know-how, patent and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We will take the necessary action to seek remuneration if we believe our intellectual property rights have been infringed upon. As of December 31, 2017, we held twenty-one active patents granted by SIPO related to breaking up and separating fruit peel; removing fruit peel and fruit hair; production of various concentrated fruit juice; and bottle tags, respectively. These patents have a duration of 10 years. However, we do not have patents on certain other intellectual property that we possess.
