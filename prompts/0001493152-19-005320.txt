ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
At our core, we are a software Company whose technology allows retailers to combat the dual threats of Walmart and Amazon — both online and in physical stores. Our Brand rollup acquisition strategy allows us to demonstrate the effectiveness of our software, devise and test new products, while providing shareholder value through immediate revenue and earnings growth. The Company operates through our subsidiaries on three continents: 12 Hong Kong, Limited (“12HK”, “12 Hong Kong, Ltd.”), 12 Japan, Limited (“12JP”, “12 Japan, Ltd.”), 12 Europe A.G. (“12EU”, “12 Europe AG”), and 12 Retail Corporation (“12 Retail”) which, with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, and sells primarily fashion products through all channels including online, wholesale to retailers, and in our own store(s) from North America. 12 Retail’s subsidiaries include: Emotion Fashion Group, Inc. (acquired May 2018), Red Wire Group, LLC (Acquired February 2019) and Rune NYC, LLC (Acquired March 2019).

In addition, this subsidiary serves as an additional marketing and sales hub for Asia, particularly the Chinese market, excluding Japan.
 
-12 Japan, Ltd., a corporation organized in Japan. The Company acquired 12 Japan, Ltd, located in Tokyo, Japan on July 31, 2017 in a share exchange transaction (see section 7 Management Discussion & Analysis). This subsidiary operates in the country of Japan. It is this subsidiary that services our first customer, Itoya, Ltd, where our technology was successfully implemented and proven. Itoya, Ltd has begun to expand the use of our technology to additional stores. Our operational staff here assists 12 Hong Kong in the maintenance requirements of our software solutions worldwide.
 
-12 Europe A.G., a corporation organized in Switzerland. The Company acquired 12 Europe A.G. on October 26, 2017 in a share exchange transaction. (see section 7 Management Discussion & Analysis). This subsidiary markets, sells, and services the Company’s proprietary and licensed technology to retailers in the European market from its base in Zurich, Switzerland. Since its acquisition, this subsidiary has already signed agreements with 4 retailers, 1 department store, and 3 local businesses to deploy our technology and 12Sconti app (see Our Technology).


Subsidiaries primarily involved in our Brand Acquisition Strategy:
 
-12 Retail Corporation, which is a holding Company, was organized in the state of Arizona, USA, and maintains an office in Scottsdale, Arizona. This subsidiary was formed on Sept. 18, 2017 to execute the Company’s Brand rollup acquisition strategy, as well as to penetrate the North American market with our technology to select retailers. All of the brands that are acquired will retain their own brand name and identity, although they will share some economies of scale and benefit from the management expertise, resources, and capital allocation available as a subsidiary of the Company. The brands will become subsidiaries of 12 Retail Corporation. Each of the brands that transact business with North American retailers will be used as a conduit or entry point for our technology subsidiaries to sell our software solutions.
 
Subsidiaries of 12 Retail Corporation:
 
That manufacture and market our Brands.
 
-Emotion Fashion Group, Inc. (“EFG”) Organized in the State of Utah on July 6, 2018, to consolidate primarily the brand assets from the Company’s acquisition on May 1, 2018 of Emotion Apparel, Inc, subsequent to that consolidation, Emotion Apparel, Inc was closed and abandoned. EFG has 5 brands: Emotion Fashions (contemporary woman’s resort wear), Lexi-Luu Dancewear (children’s dance clothes), Punkz Gear (teenage hip-hop and street wear), Skipjack dance and dive wear (swimwear; currently inactive), and Cleo VII (Accessories; currently inactive) With the acquisition of Red Wire Group, LLC, EFG has turned over all of its manufacturing operations in Salt Lake City, Utah to the efficient operational management team of Red Wire Group, LLC. (See Below).
 
-The Red Wire Group, LLC (RWG) As a subsequent event, the Company acquired 100% of the equity in The Red Wire Group, a Utah limited liability company effective February 20, 2019, through the 12 Retail Subsidiary, pursuant to an Exchange of Equity Agreement (see Section “Subsequent Events”). RWG is an efficient “cut & sew” factory with which independent third parties contract to produce clothes for sale. RWG is located almost directly across from the EFG facility, which allowed the Company to consolidate all clothing manufacturing under expert and highly trained management team of RWG, further streamlining costs. In addition, by merging both manufacturing facilities EFG becomes “just” another contract client for RWG, and RWG greatly increases its capacity to take on additional third party business.
 
-Rune NYC LLC (RUNE) As a subsequent event, on March 14, 2019, the Company acquired the controlling interest (92.5% of the equity) of RUNE, a New York limited liability company , through the 12 Retail Subsidiary, pursuant to an Exchange of Equity Agreement (see Section “Subsequent Events”). Key Management of RUNE remained with the Company to continue to expand the revenues of this contemporary woman’s Activewear and “Athleisure” brand, which is primarily sold to retailers. Its products will now primarily be manufactured in the RWG facilities, significantly lowering the product cost, allowing RUNE to sell to more retailers and begin to market online.
 
The Company continues to search for synergistic acquisitions that provide; immediate revenue, the potential for revenue growth and earnings, and may provide entries to sell our software and technology to other retailers and larger consumer brands.


The Opportunity:
 
Brick and mortar retailers continue to struggle against online competition, even though online sites haven’t changed much in 20 years. With consumers looking to purchase products in new ways with a larger focus on individualism and social sharing, retailers and merchants are searching for new ways to entice consumers through software technologies that engage consumers both online and in the physical store. These disruptive changes are affecting not just merchants and retailers, but all stages of their supply channel from design and manufacture to distribution and shipping. Consequently, many of the valuations of retailers, merchants, and their suppliers are in the trough while other retailers have simply gone out of business.

-


However, brick and mortar retailers are not all going to disappear, and we expect the future survivors to evolve, because consumers will shop when they enjoy the shopping experience. Successful online merchants will evolve too as their competitive landscape becomes more crowded. Both online and physical store merchants are learning that as consumer habits change, traditional marketing and advertising channels like television are much less effective. We call this combination of forces the “Consumer Shift”. This Consumer Shift is driving a convergence of the online/mobile merchant with the physical retailer, as we have seen with Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods, Inc. and their opening of physical book stores, and Walmart’s acquisition of Jet.com. These convergence trends will continue.
 
World-wide retailing represents approximately $28 trillion in revenues, while in 2018 in the U.S. alone, all forms of retailing represented $5.35 trillion in annual revenues (according to Statista March 2019). While management believes that the Company’s software and technologies can benefit almost all retailers, the Company will initially focus on the Apparel and Cosmetics sectors where they believe we can have the biggest impact and which market generated over $346 billion in 2018 revenues in just the U.S. (Statista March 2019).
 
The Company benefits shareholders by generating its revenue and earnings four ways: 1) Through the revenue and earnings generated from its Brands, and 2) Through the revenues generated through the sale and/or licensing of its proprietary software and technology to third party retailers and merchants, and consumer brands, 3) Through the sale and placement of advertising equipment in retail oriented venues and the placement of advertising content to that equipment, 4) Through the acquisition of synergistic companies that provide immediate revenue and the potential for revenue and earnings growth.


Our Technology:
 
The Company’s patented, proprietary technology products, software and services, as well as management expertise, directly addresses the Consumer Shift with software solutions that seamlessly engage consumers both in the physical store and online retailing, encourage social sharing, and advertising while lowering retailer and merchants’ operating costs. We will deploy our technology ourselves at our microbrands where we demonstrate its effectiveness and develop additional feature sets.
 
Adoption and Deployment of our Software:
 
Over the last ten months, the Company has been further developing and refining our proprietary modular software platform, which we have coupled with the latest hardware to further provide engaging experiences for consumers that will allow retailers to sell more products, attract consumers back to their stores, track purchases and consumer interests, and reduce their employee costs. Our improved platform will be available for sale in mid-April 2019, and will be available in multiple languages to support our three continent efforts (English, Japanese, German, and French, with more languages to be added).
 
Retailers have already expressed interest in our software solutions, recognizing that we demonstrate the 3P’s of successful technology: “Proven, Proprietary, and Patented”. Itoya has already successfully installed our technology in its 13-story lifestyle store in Tokyo and has begun to add our technology and software solutions in additional stores. We are in various stages of talks with other retailers in Japan and throughout Asia.
 
In Europe, we have entered a partnership, and announced on April 1st, 2019, the launch of our 12 Sconti App to its customers.
 
In North America, the Company has begun discussions with a number of retailers that we were able to target as a result of our recent acquisition of RUNE.
 
Our Acquisition Strategy:
 
The Company targets for acquisition those synergistic companies that provide immediate revenue, and the potential for growth in revenue and earnings and/or may provide entries to sell our software and technology to other retailers and consumer brands, and/or will provide support services to our existing operations. Therefore, we target brands that can benefit from our technology platform and expertise to grow their operations, brands that can give us entry into other retailers, and support companies for those brands and our technology such as clothing manufacturers and advertising and or marketing firms.
 
Generally, we now look for companies that have annual revenues in excess of $1.0 million where existing, talented Management wishes to remain and grow with us that have been constrained with a lack of capital or expertise. Companies less than $1.0 million in revenue may be acquired if they fit inside the organizational and sales structure of one of our existing operating companies. We are, of course, always looking to acquire larger companies and in fact have been and are still in talks with larger entities, but these are our minimum requirements. Support companies in new industries that can support our existing operations would only be acquired if existing management is retained and whose corporate culture fits with our own.
 
Brand Acquisitions:
 
Our initial efforts for our Brand acquisitions are focused around fashion brands and related products due to the high margins, wide acceptance, and their affinity to benefit from our technology platform. Management defines a target “brand” (“Brand”) as “any brand that generates under $50 million in annual revenue”. With many brick and mortar retail sales in decline due to the Consumer Shift, management believes that there is a strong opportunity to acquire Brands based on their generally reduced trough valuations that, through the deployment of our technologies, can produce outsized returns and be generally accretive to our business. Since these Brands are small, they can be targeted to smaller individual niche demographics, providing the individuality required by the Consumer Shift. Each of our Brands are and will be complementary to each other and generally benefit from our technologies.
 
We have acquired a number of Brands over the last 18 months including EFG, RWG and Rune, and we expect to realize significant revenues from these acquisitions throughout 2019.

With the acquisition of significant profitable Brands, the Company may become self-sufficient, able to generate its own cash flow to minimize the need to raise capital to support its software development, sales and deployment.
 
Our Technology Strategy:
 
Management believes that adoption of our software technology and strategies by physical and online retailers and merchants is the only way for them to combat the threats posed by Amazon and Walmart. Additional threats are posed by Google and Facebook (which also owns Instagram), that together with Amazon dominate the vast majority of online searches. Our technology platform will provide some alternatives to the “Big 4” (“Amazon, Walmart, Google, and Facebook”), as well as being better able to utilize the tools and reach of the Big 4.
 
Here’s how:
 
With adoption by major retailers of our 12 Mobile APP, consumers will now be able to shop multiple brands from one platform, get valuable information within the physical stores, fully utilize our interactive 12 Mirrors and 12 AD Screens inside their stores, and share their experiences with others- resulting in building that retailer’s brand. Our engaging software creates experiences for shoppers to get them back into the stores where the retailers can compete much more effectively with the Big 4.
 
For retailers, our API’s can connect the retailer’s ERP systems and payment processing to our administrative APP on our platform. This allows their sales associates to have all the information at their fingertips that a consumer could want to know like: where the product is made, information about the warranty, what colors it comes in, care instructions, and how many are in stock, as well as price. It also provides suggestions of what else to offer the customers directly at the time of purchase to increase the sales ticket and improve consumer satisfaction. This minimizes training time, allows for less sales people on the sales floor while providing superior customer services (no more waiting on lines at a register). These processes increase revenue and lower costs. Our technology encourages consumers to share information about items they like and purchases they made creating engagement with their extended network and friends.
 
Our platform, which we market as the 12 Technology Suite, is modular, and allows each retailer to custom tailor which products or services will best engage their consumers creating experiences unique to their stores. Retailers easily manage all aspects of our platform from the 12 Dashboard, which allows them to add products, change offers, and push offers to consumers on the network easily and efficiently.
 
12 Technology Suite
 
We anticipate that the 12 Technology Suite (“12 Suite”) will be the next disruptive innovator in the retail sector. Simply put, 12 Suite is an interactive shopping cart that seamlessly combines shopping and social networking for a fun and unique shopping experience. 12 Suite integrates in-store, online, and mobile shopping with its smart mirror (“12Mirror”), 12Mobile APP, and 12Kiosk, while an interactive advertising screen, the 12 AD Screen, provides special offers from shops, restaurants, and service providers. Over next 36 months, the Company will be deploying its proprietary 12 Suite (software, hardware (the 12Mirror), applications for the iPhone, iPad, and Android phones and tablets (12Mobile)) that integrates traditional shopping, on-line shopping, entertainment and social networking into a “Totally Integrated Retail Platform”.
 
The first fully-integrated store (13 story lifestyle store) has been fully implemented in Tokyo, Japan and is running successfully since the beginning of 2016. More stores, for the same retailer, are now coming online, and we continue to be approached by other retailers around the world. Our updated and improved software will be available for sale beginning by mid-April 2019.

Our Platform is known as USXS
 
USXS – Unifying Shopping eXperience System® - Management believes that the USXS is the solution for all retail problems related to reaching the consumer; the connector of any available technology system and the generator of a truly shopping and entertainment experience for consumers. Our technology is based on the full integration of the 12Mirror / 12ADScreen connected with 12Kiosk, 12Mobile and e-commerce. The whole technology will enable consumers to be independent and freely share information with friends.
 
We call this the “12 Experience”. We believe that the 12 Experience offers both retailers and customers an exciting, timesaving and efficient way to enjoy and to fully become immersed within the traditional retail environment.
 
We believe that:
 

● | 12 ReTech will set a new trend in retailing; changing the way shopping and advertising is done 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 12 ReTech will connect people to business and people to people 
● | 12 ReTech will be the first offering a real-time service to consumers wherever they are located 
● | 12 ReTech will build on the complete integration of four fundamental retail and entertainment components: Traditional Shopping; Online/Mobile Shopping; Social Networking; PR - Advertising and Entertainment 

Industry Overview
 

● | E-commerce has increased 20% on average each year but remains at only 8% of total commerce. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Many shoppers visit physical shops but purchase online looking for lower a price. 
● | Untrained retailer staff cannot help effectively and can struggle to make consumers happy. 
● | Waiting in line, waiting for fitting rooms, or waiting to pay, can be frustrating and has the potential to make customers exit the store without purchasing. 
● | Small retailers cannot afford to spend significant money on advertising or technology. 
● | Retailers are reluctant to fully embrace the potential of new technologies if it costs them significant money and is difficult to implement the new system. 
● | There is a need to provide an easier way to get special offers to consumers. 

Disruptive Technology
 
The Company is deploying its technology in traditional retail outlets in order to allow for a seamless and novel approach to traditional retail shopping models. In order to advance our concept, we have identified several key concepts that we believe are the cornerstones of our business in the coming months and years. We believe that consumers want to shop in a seamless way, avoiding long lines and avoiding the frustrations that traditional retail shopping has long since been mired.

We firmly believe that the modern shopper:
 

● | Wants to evaluate products all the time, not only while shopping.

What does it bring to Customers?
 
12 ReTech’s technology helps drive more customers to the store and helps to increase sales due to the fact that customers will spend more time in the store browsing and checking products, sales can also be generated after store closure, sales can be generated after the consumer shows the product to friends and speaks with them. The technology allows retailers to receive customized information about customers, learn and understand their behavior and shopping patterns, while providing improved and customized offers to consumers. Customers create free advertising for the retailers through the sharing of pictures taken in the stores.
