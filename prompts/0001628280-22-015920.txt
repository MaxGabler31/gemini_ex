ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Iteris, Inc. (referred to collectively with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, ClearAg, Inc. and Albeck Gerken, Inc. ("AGI"), in this report as "Iteris," the "Company," "we," "our," and "us") is a provider of smart mobility infrastructure management solutions. Our cloud-enabled end-to-end solutions help public transportation agencies, municipalities, commercial entities and other transportation infrastructure providers monitor, visualize, and optimize mobility infrastructure to make mobility safe, efficient and sustainable for everyone.
As a pioneer in intelligent transportation systems ("ITS") technology, our intellectual property, advanced detection sensors, mobility and traffic data, software-as-a-service ("SaaS") offerings, mobility consulting services and end-to-end solutions delivered as cloud-enabled managed services represent a comprehensive range of smart mobility infrastructure management solutions that we distribute to customers throughout the United States ("U.S.") and internationally.
We believe our products, solutions and services increase safety and decrease congestion within our communities, while also minimizing environmental impact.
We continue to make significant investments to leverage our existing technologies and further enhance our advanced detection sensors, mobility intelligence software, mobility data sets, mobility consulting services, and cloud-enabled managed services. As we are always mindful of capital allocation, we apply significant effort to evaluate and prioritize these investments. Likewise, we are always exploring strategic alternatives intended to optimize the value of our Company.

Recent Developments
COVID-19 Update
The COVID-19 pandemic (the “Pandemic”) has materially adversely impacted global economic conditions. More than 24 months into the Pandemic, COVID-19 continues to have an unpredictable and unprecedented impact on the global economy. Though there has been a trend in increasing availability of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as an easing of restrictions on social, business, travel and government activities and functions, infection rates continue to fluctuate and federal, state and local government regulations continue to rapidly change. The uncertainties caused by the Pandemic include, but are not limited to, supply chain disruptions, workplace dislocations, economic contraction, and downward pressure on some customer budgets and customer sentiment in general. We have not had any facility closures due to the Pandemic, but we have experienced supply chain and work delays on certain projects. Should such delays become protracted or worsen or should longer-term budgets or priorities of our clients be impacted, the Pandemic could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the Pandemic on our business and financial results, and the volatility of our stock price will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the Pandemic, new and potentially more contagious variants, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, the impact on capital and financial markets, the distribution, rate of adoption and efficacy of vaccines, and the related impact on the budgets and financial circumstances of our customers and suppliers, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated as of the date of this report.
Given the uncertainties surrounding the impacts of the Pandemic on the Company's future financial condition and results of operations, we have taken certain actions to preserve our liquidity, manage cash flow and strengthen our financial flexibility. Such actions included, but are not limited to, reducing our discretionary spending, reducing capital expenditures, and implementing restructuring activities. Refer to Note 4, Restructuring Activities, for more information.
Our products require specialized parts which have become more difficult to source. In some cases, we have had to purchase such parts from third-party brokers at substantially higher prices. Additionally, to mitigate for component shortages, we have begun to increase inventory levels and may continue to do so for an extended period. In the event demand doesn’t materialize, we may need to hold excess inventory for several quarters. Alternatively, we may be unable to source sufficient components, even from third-party brokers, to meet customer demand, resulting in high levels of unshippable backlog. We have placed non-
cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our normal lead times to secure normal and incremental future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future. Still, we may remain supply-constrained beyond the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 ("Fiscal 2022"). 
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was signed into law in the United States. The CARES Act provides relief to U.S. corporations through financial assistance programs and modifications to certain income tax provisions. The Company is applying certain beneficial provisions of the CARES Act, including the payroll tax deferral and the alternative minimum tax acceleration (see Note 6, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including in Part II, Item 8 of this report).
The Pandemic has had an impact on the Company’s human capital. While our Santa Ana product and commercial operations facility has remained open, easing of Pandemic restrictions imposed by local and state authorities have allowed a portion of our workforce to return to our various facilities while others continue to work remotely. The Company’s information technology infrastructure has proven sufficiently flexible to minimize disruptions in required duties and responsibilities. Additionally, we have been able to timely file financial reports. We believe we have the right infrastructure to efficiently work remotely for the balance of the Pandemic. We do not expect to incur significant costs to safely reopen our facilities to all our employees.
The Company assessed the impacts of the Pandemic on the estimates and assumptions used in preparing these audited consolidated financial statements. The estimates and assumptions used in these assessments were based on management’s judgment and may be subject to change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the Pandemic and its resulting impact on global economic conditions. If economic conditions caused by the Pandemic do not recover as currently estimated by management, the Company’s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially impacted. See below for areas that required more judgments and estimates as a result of the Pandemic. The Company will continue to assess the effect on its operations by monitoring the spread of the Pandemic and the actions implemented to combat the virus throughout the world. As a result, our assessment of the impact of the Pandemic may change.
Acquisition of the Assets of TrafficCast International, Inc.
On December 6, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “TrafficCast Purchase Agreement”) with TrafficCast International, Inc. (“TrafficCast”), a privately held company headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin that provides travel information technology, applications and content to customers throughout North America in the media, mobile technology, automotive and public sectors. Under the TrafficCast Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to purchase from TrafficCast substantially all of its assets, composed of its travel information technology, applications and content (the “TrafficCast Business”) and assume certain specified liabilities of the TrafficCast Business in exchange for a total purchase price of up to $17.7 million. 
The $17.7 million in total consideration was comprised of $15.0 million paid in cash on the closing date, $1.0 million held back as security for certain post-closing adjustments and post-closing indemnity obligations of TrafficCast, $1.1 million acquisition-related liability, and a $1.0 million earn out, fair valued at $0.6 million as of March 31, 2021, that if earned, will be paid over two years based on the TrafficCast Business’ achievement of certain revenue targets. The TrafficCast Purchase Agreement also provided for customary post-closing adjustments to the purchase price tied to working capital balances of the TrafficCast Business at closing (see Note 12, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The transaction closed on December 7, 2020.
Simultaneous with closing the transaction, the parties entered into certain ancillary agreements that will provide Iteris with ongoing access to mapping and monitoring services that the TrafficCast Business uses to support its real-time and predictive travel data and associated content.
Public Offering and Acquisition of Albeck Gerken, Inc.
On June 13, 2019, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 6,182,797 shares of the Company's common stock for net proceeds to the Company of approximately $26.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used approximately $6.2 million of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the cash portion of the purchase price in the acquisition of AGI, a privately-held professional transportation engineering services firm headquartered in Tampa, Florida (see Note 12, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and plans to use the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and possibly for other future acquisitions.
Sale of Agriculture and Weather Analytics Business
On May 5, 2020, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of our assets used in connection with our former Agriculture and Weather Analytics business to DTN, LLC (“DTN”), an operating company of TBG AG, a Swiss-based holding company, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “AWA Purchase Agreement”) signed on May 2, 2020, in exchange for a total purchase consideration of $12.0 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Upon closing, the Company received $10.5 million in cash and $1.5 million of payment was deferred. DTN paid the Company $1.45 million at the 12-month anniversary of the closing date, and $0.05 million at the 18-month anniversary of the closing date. (See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
Restructuring Activities
On April 30, 2020, in connection with the sale of the Agriculture and Weather Analytics business, the Board of Directors of Iteris, Inc. approved restructuring activities to better position the Company for increased profitability and growth. Restructuring charges of approximately $1.5 million were incurred for separation costs for certain employees who did not transition to DTN, additional positions that were eliminated to right-size the cost structure of the Company, and the impairment of certain lease-related assets (see Note 4, Restructuring Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
Products and Services
Iteris provides comprehensive smart mobility infrastructure solutions for public-sector and private-sector customers primarily located in North America. These solutions include traveler information systems, transportation performance measurement software, traffic analytics software, transportation operations software, transportation-related data sets, advanced sensing devices, managed services, traffic engineering services, and mobility consulting services. Beginning December 7, 2020, Iteris includes the public-sector and private-sector operations of TrafficCast (see Note 12, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details on the acquisition of TrafficCast). 
Software Solutions
Iteris offers our public-sector and private-sector customers a portfolio of industry-leading smart mobility infrastructure software solutions. These software solutions include ClearGuide, ClearRoute, Commercial Vehicle Operations, BlueArgus, TrafficCarma and others as described below. 
•ClearGuide, which is provided on a software-as-a-service basis, is a state-of-the-art mobility intelligence and transportation performance measures solution. It utilizes a wide range of data resources and analytical techniques to determine current and future traffic patterns to enable the effective performance analysis and management of traffic infrastructure resources at various levels – highway, arterial (i.e., corridor), or intersection. At times, we refer to intersection performance analytics as signal performance measurement ("SPM"). ClearGuide users can measure how a transportation network is performing and identify potential areas of improvement. These applications are also capable of providing users with predictive traffic analytics, and easy-to-use visualization and animation features based on historical traffic conditions.
•ClearRoute delivers contextual, real-time, actionable mobility intelligence and traveler information services on a platform-as-a-service basis. ClearRoute provides multimodal, multilingual, traveler information via mobile apps, websites, email and text alerts, and Interactive Voice Response ("IVR"). The ClearRoute solution benefits from a powerful, flexible and streamlined infrastructure to help reduce congestion and improve safety and mobility for transportation networks across the country, and facilitates frictionless interoperability, flexible provisioning, and robust management of customer focused data.
•Commercial vehicle operations and vehicle safety compliance applications, which are provided on a software-as-a-service basis include various applications branded as ClearFleet, CVIEW-Plus, CheckPoint, UCRLink, and Inspect. Collectively, these software applications support state-based commercial vehicles operations by storing and distributing intrastate and interstate commercial vehicle information for local, state, and federal agency roadside and enforcement operations. 
•TrafficCarma, which is easily white labeled, is the first mobile application focused on the 120 million U.S. daily commuters and their journeys to and from work, train stations, airports, sporting events and other destinations. TrafficCarma provides advice on known route choices, not turn-by-turn navigation. It is personalized for peoples’ daily commutes and the roads they drive most. Verified crowdsourced content is combined with road speed data, public agency reports, camera imaging and other metrics and delivers users information relevant to their commute and other personal routes. 
•VantageLive! is a software-a-as-service solution that allows users to collect, process and analyze advanced intersection data for our Vantage sensors, as well as to view and understand intersection activity
•BlueARGUS is a software-as-a-service solution that collects, analyzes, and visualizes various information related to travel times, speeds, and origin-destination from our BlueTOAD Spectra sensors and connected vehicle information from our BlueTOAD Spectra RSU sensors. 
Mobility Data Sets
ClearData is the enhanced mobility data output of the Iteris ClearMobility Cloud, a suite of data integration and analytics engines that aggregates and validates both proprietary and diversely sourced data inputs, including incidents, construction and connected vehicle GPS probes. Following processing and quality assurance, ClearData reflects real-time road conditions and is delivered to public- and private-sector customers via subscription-based direct data feeds or application programming interfaces (APIs), or through ClearGuide, our mobility intelligence and transportation performance measures software solution. The complex, dynamic nature of roadway traffic cannot be explained by any single data source. ClearData resolves data conflicts through proprietary algorithms and selective quality control from experienced traffic analysts.
Advanced Sensors
Iteris offers advanced intersection detection and other fixed traffic sensors that collectively comprise our two sensor families – Vantage and BlueTOAD. Increasingly, we bundle communications systems and traffic data collection applications (e.g., VantageLive! and BlueARGUS) with our sensor products.
The Vantage family of sensors uses advanced image processing technology, radar technology and other techniques to observe multi-modal traffic (e.g., vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian), translate these observations into structured data, and apply sophisticated, proprietary algorithms to this structured data to optimize traffic signal performance in real-time. Certain Vantage sensors apply machine learning techniques for enhanced object classification. In addition to detecting the presence of objects, our Vantage systems record vehicle count, speed and other traffic information used in traffic management systems. Thus, our Vantage systems give traffic managers the tools to mitigate roadway congestion by visualizing and analyzing traffic patterns, allowing them to modify traffic signal timing to improve traffic flow. Our various software components complement our Vantage detection systems by providing integrated platforms to manage and view detection assets remotely over a network connection, as well as mobile application for viewing anywhere. The Vantage family of sensors includes Vantage Apex, Vantage Fusion, Vantage Next, VantagePegasus, VantageRadius, Vantage Vector, Velocity, SmartCycle, SmartCycle Bike Indicator, SmartSpan, VersiCam, PedTrax, and P-Series products.
•Vantage Fusion is a connected-vehicle (CV) focused detection product that tracks and reports vehicles and pedestrians in and around intersections. This product helps the industry bridge the currently fledgling CV market to an eventually CV-dominant world by providing non-CV vehicle locations (and details) to the CV network. This product is developed in partnership with Continental AG, a global automotive parts manufacturer and leading CV equipment provider. 
•Vantage Apex is the industry’s first full 1080p high-definition (HD) video and 4D/HD radar hybrid sensor with integrated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Vantage Apex provides precise and detailed detection, tracking and classification of traffic.
•Vantage Vector is a hybrid video and radar detection sensor with a wide range of capabilities, including stop bar and advanced zone detection, which enable advanced safety and adaptive control applications. 
•SmartCycle capability, which can effectively differentiate between bicycles and other vehicles with a single video detection camera, is available with all of our Vantage systems. SmartCycle enables more efficient signalized intersections, improved traffic throughput and increased bicyclist safety. Agencies using bicycle timing benefit from bicycle-specific virtual detection zones that can be placed anywhere within the approaching traffic lanes, eliminating the need for separate bicycle-only detection systems.
•SmartCycle Bike Indicator, which leverages the SmartCycle bicycle detection algorithm, is a device that mounts onto traffic signals and illuminates when cyclists waiting at an intersection have been detected, allowing cyclists to avoid interacting with vehicle traffic to push pole-mounted buttons.
•PedTrax capability, which is also available with all of our Vantage systems, provides bi-directional pedestrian counting and speed tracking within the crosswalk to help improve signal timing efficiency, as well as providing an additional data stream to existing vehicle and bicycle counts.
•VersiCam, an integrated camera and processor video detection system, is a cost-efficient video detection system for smaller intersections that require only a few detection points.
The BlueTOAD product family combines unique MAC Address capture with the latest Connected Vehicle technologies. The combination of these two technologies provides customers with a market leading sensor along with a comprehensive data set that enables advanced analytics through our SaaS offerings. The BlueTOAD family of sensors includes BlueTOAD Spectra and BlueTOAD Spectra RSU, both of which we bundle with a Cloud-based software application branded as BlueARGUS.
•BlueTOAD Spectra is a complete system for identifying the travel times of vehicles using advanced Bluetooth re-identification techniques. This provides traffic flow information for vehicle travel as well as Origin-Destination information.
•BlueTOAD Spectra RSU is a full-featured connected vehicle and travel time information system. In addition to travel times and vehicle speeds it communicates vital safety and mobility information via both DSRC and C-V2X from infrastructure to vehicles and other users.
In select territories, the Company also sells certain complementary original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") products for the traffic intersection market, which include, among other things, traffic signal controllers and traffic signal equipment cabinets.
We believe that future growth domestically and internationally for our Vantage family of products, will be dependent in part on the continued replacement of adoption of traditional in-pavement loop technology with above-ground video and radar detection technologies to manage traffic.
Managed Services
Iteris Managed Services offer traffic management centers ("TMC") design, staffing, and operations services to public agencies, whether they need to create a new TMC or migrate an existing TMC network to a virtual environment. Iteris partners with agencies to augment their internal capability and provide the foundation and expertise required to successfully implement virtual TMCs to support goals such as capital or recurring cost savings, operation from any location, and staff security and flexibility.
Additionally, Iteris’ cloud-enabled managed services combine software-as-a-service, smart sensors and consulting expertise to proactively address the challenges of monitoring and maintaining intersections, arterials and highways along with their related in-field technology. These services include congestion and asset management areas of focus, combining innovative traffic optimization with hardware inventory and maintenance. 
With Iteris Managed Services, public transportation agencies, real estate developers, construction firms, and event operators can save time and money while better keeping road users safe and ensuring that traffic flows efficiently.
Traffic Engineering and Mobility Consulting
Our traffic engineering and mobility consulting services include planning, design, development and implementation of software and hardware-based ITS systems that integrate sensors, video surveillance, computers and advanced communications equipment to enable public agencies to monitor, control and direct traffic flow, assist in the quick dispatch of emergency crews, and distribute real-time information about traffic conditions. Our services also include planning, design, implementation, operation and management of surface transportation infrastructure systems. We perform analysis and study goods movement, provide travel demand forecasting and systems engineering, and identify mitigation measures to reduce traffic congestion. 
ClearMobility Platform
With the company’s introduction of the ClearMobility Platform, we aligned our entire portfolio of solutions under a common branding structure. We believe this alignment will drive internal synergies, increase our cross-sell rate, enhance sales productivity, and increase market awareness of our entire solutions portfolio. Additionally, we launched the ClearMobility Cloud that enables seamless interoperation among our solutions via a common mobility data management engine, application 
programming interface ("API") framework, and microservices ecosystem that provides standardized data ingestion, cleansing, and analytics, as well as authentication and policy-based security for each component of the ClearMobility Platform. ClearMobility Cloud is both horizontally scalable and third-party extensible. 
 Because we are now aligning, harmonizing, and optimizing our portfolio of individual solutions to a common platform, the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluates financial and operational performance holistically. As such, in fiscal 2022 we began reporting as a single operating segment.
Market Conditions
Currently, over 90% of our revenue is attributable to public-sector customers. Therefore, most of our revenue is dependent upon state and local government funding, and to a lesser extent federal governmental funding. In some cases, this funding is appropriated annually through the respective legislative process. In other cases, various dedicated funding mechanisms exist to support transportation infrastructure and related projects, including, but not limited to dedicated sales and gas tax measures, vehicle and permit fees, and other alternative dedicated funding sources. Additionally, some of our activities may be funded through bond measures. 
We believe that overall demand for our solutions will continue to be dependent at least in part on the federal and local government's use of funds, and as in the past, our business may be, at times, adversely affected by governmental budgetary issues. Therefore, we were pleased that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ("IIJA") became effective on November 15, 2021. The IIJA will contribute $1.2 trillion to fund physical infrastructure and public works, adding $550 billion to existing levels of transportation-specific funding. With that funding pool, areas of direct relevant to Iteris include $110 billion for roads, bridges and major projects, $39 billion for public transit, and $11 billion for transportation safety. However, delays in the allocation of funds may prolong uncertainty regarding the allotment of transportation funds in federal, state and local budgets.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our software, mobility data, managed services, traffic engineering, and mobility consulting services to government agencies pursuant to negotiated contracts that involve competitive bidding and specific qualification requirements. Most of our contracts are with federal, state and local municipal customers, and generally provide for cancellation or renegotiation at the option of the customer upon reasonable notice and fees paid for modification. We generally use selected members of our traffic engineering, mobility consulting, data science and product management teams on a regional basis to serve in sales and business development functions. Our traffic engineering and mobility consulting service contracts generally involve long lead times and require extensive specification development, evaluation and price negotiations.
We sell our Vantage and BlueTOAD product families along with their related software bundles through both direct and indirect sales channels. Where we sell direct, we use a combination of our own sales personnel and outside sales organizations to sell, oversee installations, and support our products. Our indirect sales channel comprises a network of independent distributors in the U.S. and select international locations, which sell integrated systems and related products to the traffic management market. Our independent distributors are trained in and primarily responsible for the sales, installation, set-up and support of our products. They maintain an inventory of demonstration traffic products from various manufacturers, who sell directly to government agencies and installation contractors. These distributors often have long-term arrangements with local government agencies in their respective territories for the supply of various products for the construction and renovation of traffic intersections, as they are generally well-known suppliers of various high-quality ITS products to the traffic management market. We periodically hold technical training classes for our distributors and end-users, and we maintain a full-time staff of customer support technicians throughout the U.S. to provide technical assistance when needed. When appropriate, we modify or make changes to our distributor network to accommodate the needs of the market and our customer base.
With the acquisition of the TrafficCast Business on December 7, 2020, we now sell traffic and mobility data and software through a direct sales model to commercial enterprises, such as media companies involved in providing real-time traffic data and traffic incident data to insurance companies, automotive OEMs and the traveling public. 
We have historically had a diverse customer base. For Fiscal 2022, fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 ("Fiscal 2021"), and fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 ("Fiscal 2020"), no individual customer represented greater than 10% of our total revenues. As of March 31, 2022 and 2021, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our total trade accounts receivable.
Manufacturing and Materials
We use contract manufacturers to build subassemblies that are used in our products. Additionally, we procure certain components for our products from qualified suppliers, both in the U.S. and internationally, and generally use multi-sourcing 
strategies when technically and economically feasible to mitigate supply risk. These subassemblies and components are typically delivered to our Santa Ana, California facility where they go through final assembly and testing prior to shipment to our customers. Our key suppliers include Veris Manufacturing and MoboTrex, Inc. Our assembly and test activities are conducted in approximately 9,000 square feet of space at our Santa Ana, California facility. Production volume at our subcontractors is based upon bi-annual forecasts that we generally adjust on a monthly basis to control inventory levels. Typically, we do not manufacture any of the hardware used in the transportation management and traveler information systems that we design and implement. Our production facility maintains a Quality Management System that is currently certified as conforming to all requirements of the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") 9001:2015 international standard.
Customer Support and Services
We provide warranty service and support for our products, as well as follow-up service and support for which we charge separately. Such service revenue was not a material portion of our total revenues for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020. We believe customer support is a key competitive factor for our Company.
Backlog
Our total backlog of unfulfilled firm orders was approximately $99.9 million at March 31, 2022. We expect to recognize revenue of approximately 75% of our backlog as of the end of a fiscal year in the subsequent fiscal year. At March 31, 2021, we had backlog of approximately $78.1 million. The increase in backlog in the current fiscal year was generally attributable to overall strong demand for our products and services, as well as the timing of the receipt of some large contracts. 
Backlog is an operational measure representing future unearned revenue amounts believed to be firm and earned under existing agreements. Backlog is not included in deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. Backlog does not include contract awards for which definitive contracts have not been executed. We believe backlog is a useful metric for investors, given its relevance to total orders.
The timing and realization of our backlog is subject to the inherent uncertainties of doing business with federal, state and local governments, particularly in view of budgetary constraints, cut-backs and other delays or reallocations of funding that these entities typically face. In addition, pursuant to the customary terms of our agreements with government contractors and other customers, our customers can generally cancel or reschedule orders with little or no penalties. Lead times for the release of purchase orders often depend upon the scheduling and forecasting practices of our individual customers, which also can affect the timing of the conversion of our backlog into revenues. For these reasons, among others, our backlog at a particular date may not be indicative of our future revenues.
Product Development
Our product development activities are mostly conducted at our facility in Santa Ana, California, as well as our facilities in Madison, Wisconsin and Oakland, California. Our research and development costs and expenses were approximately $7.4 million for Fiscal 2022, $5.1 million for Fiscal 2021, and $4.3 million for Fiscal 2020. We expect to continue to pursue various product development programs and incur research and development expenditures for the Company in future periods.
We believe our engineering and product development capabilities are a competitive strength. We strive to continuously develop new products, technologies, features and functionalities to meet the needs of our ever-changing markets, as well as to enhance, improve upon, and refine our existing product lines. We plan to continue to invest in the development of further enhancement and functionality of our ClearMobility Platform.
Competition
Generally, we face significant competition in each of our target markets. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The markets in which we operate are highly fragmented and subject to evolving national and regional quality, operations and safety standards. Our competitors vary in number, scope and breadth of the products and services they offer. Our competitors in the managed services and consulting business lines include a mix of local, regional and international engineering services firms. Our competitors in the software business line (e.g., performance measurement and management, advanced traveler information systems, and our commercial vehicle operations and vehicle safety compliance platforms) include university affiliated software organizations and, venture backed software companies, as well as other multi-disciplinary hardware and software corporations.
In the market for our products, we compete with manufacturers and distributors of other above-ground video camera and radar detection systems and manufacturers and distributors of other non-intrusive detection devices (e.g., microwave, infrared, radar, ultrasonic and magnetic detectors), as well as manufacturers and installers of in-pavement inductive loop products, which have historically been, and currently continue to be, the predominant vehicle detection system in this market. Additionally, products such as BlueTOAD and VantagePegasus compete against various competitors in the travel-time and data communications markets, respectively.
In general, the markets for the products and services we offer are highly competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. Many of our current and prospective competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, access to larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, distribution and marketing resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging standards or technologies, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. It is also possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. We believe that our ability to compete effectively in our target markets will depend on a number of factors, including the success and timing of our new product development, the compatibility of our products with a broad range of computing systems, product quality and performance, reliability, functionality, price and service, and technical support. Our failure to provide services and develop and market products that compete successfully with those of other suppliers and consultants in our target markets would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology. Our policy is to obtain appropriate proprietary rights protection for any potentially significant new technology acquired or developed by us. We currently have a total of 30 issued U.S. patents, including: (i) 17 relating to our advanced sensor technologies, (ii) 7 relating to our engineering and consulting services technologies and (iii) 6 related to our purchase of the TrafficCast Business. We had a total of 2 pending patent applications in the U.S. We currently have 5 issued foreign patents and 2 foreign patent applications related to our purchase of the TrafficCast Business. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2026 to 2040. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
In addition to patent laws, we rely on copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with customers and suppliers, proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants, and other similar measures. We do not have any material licenses or trademarks other than those relating to product names. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary rights. While we believe our patents, patent applications, software and other proprietary know-how have value, rapidly evolving technology makes our future success dependent largely upon our ability to successfully achieve continuing innovation.
Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our proprietary rights, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend us against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. An adverse outcome in such litigation or similar proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from others or require us to cease marketing or using certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of addressing any intellectual property litigation claim, both in legal fees and expenses, as well as from the diversion of management's resources, regardless of whether the claim is valid, could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Employees
As of March 31, 2022, we employed 428 full-time employees and 16 part-time employees, for a total of 444 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
Government Regulation
Our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those restricting the discharge of materials into the environment. We are not involved in any pending or, to our knowledge, threatened governmental proceedings, which would require curtailment of our operations because of such laws and regulations. We continue to expend funds in connection with our compliance with applicable environmental regulations. These expenditures have not, however, been significant in the past, and we do not expect any significant expenditure in the near future. Currently, 
compliance with foreign laws has not had a material impact on our business; however, as we expand internationally, foreign laws and regulations could have a material impact on our business in the future.
