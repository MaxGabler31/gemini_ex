ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

 
The Company developed and manufactured the Voraxial Separator and currently manufactures and sells the V-Inline Separator, a unique separation technology that efficiently separates large volumes of liquid/liquid, liquid/solids or liquid/liquid/solids fluid mixtures with distinct specific gravities. Current and potential commercial applications and markets for the V-Inline Separator include mining, utilities, manufacturing, utilities, waste-to-energy among other industries.
 
On March 13, 2017, we entered into a Technology Purchase Agreement with Schlumberger Technology Corporation, a Texas corporation, Schlumberger Canada Limited, a Canadian entity, and Schlumberger B.V., an entity organized under the laws of the Netherlands (collectively, Schlumberger) pursuant to which we sold our intellectual property, substantially consisting of the Voraxial patents, marks, software and copyrights, to Schlumberger in consideration of $4,000,000. As part of the agreement, Schlumberger granted us a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free licenses (the Grant Back Licenses), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products and processes embodying the Voraxial intellectual property outside the oil and gas market. Under the terms of the agreement, we can no longer use the tradename Voraxial and we subsequently branded the technology licensed to us as the V-Inline. Our management believes that the Grant Back Licenses can potentially provide additional revenues through the sale of V-Inline Separators outside the oil and gas industry, including, but not limited to mining, utilities, sewage and industrial wastewater. In 2021 our customer successfully commissioned a wastewater system at a nuclear facility comprised of multiple V-Inline Separators to separate solids and oil from their wastewater stream. The system is being used to process and separate oil and solids from a flow of about 100 gallons per minute. The System includes different technologies with the heart of the system being comprised of two V-Inline 2000 Separators working in parallel with a third V-Inline Separator being utilized to further dewater the reject lines from the System. Management believes there are many opportunities similar to this installation available for the V-Inline Separator not only in the utilities industry but other industries as well including those previously mentioned.
 
The V-Inline Separator is a continuous flow turbo machine that generates a strong centrifugal force, a vortex, capable of separating light and heavy liquids, such as oil and water, or any other combination of liquids and solids at extremely high flow rates. As the fluid passes through the machine, the V-Inline Separator accomplishes this separation through the creation of a vortex. In liquid/liquid and liquid/solid mixtures, this vortex causes the heavier compounds to gravitate to the outside of the flow and the lighter elements to move to the center where an inner core is formed. The liquid stream processed by the machine is divided into separate streams of heavier and lighter liquids and solids. As a result of this process, separation is achieved.
 
The benefits of the V-Inline Separator include: 
 

- | High volume / small footprint 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | No Pressure drop requirement 
- | High G force 
- | Treats a wide range of flows, even slugging flows 
- | Handles fluctuation in flow rates without any adjustments 
- | Handles fluctuation in contaminates without any adjustments 
- | Separation of 2 or 3 components simultaneously 
- | Non-clogging - open rotor assembly 
- | Low maintenance with ease of operation and installation 
- | Can operate dry 
- | Since there is no pressure drop, there is very little wear caused by sand 

 
The V-Inline Separator is a self-contained, non-clogging device that can be powered by an electric motor, diesel engine or by hydraulic power generation. Further, its scalability allows it to be utilized in a variety of industries and to process various amounts of liquid. The following are the various sizes and the corresponding capacity range:

Model Number | Diameter Size | Capacity Range Gallons Per Minute 
-----------------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------
V1000 | 1 inch | 3-5 
V2000 | 2 inches | 20-70 
V4000 | 4 inches | 100-500 
V8000 | 8 inches | 1,000-3,500 

 
While our net revenues in 2021 have not rebounded from the pre-pandemic period, we remain firm in our belief that the need for effective and cost efficient wastewater treatment and separation technology is global in scale. Moreover, virtually every industry requires some type of separation process either during the manufacturing process, prior to treatment or discharge of wastewater into the environment, for general clean up, or emergency response capability. Separation processes, however, are largely unknown to the average consumer. These processes are deeply integrated in almost all industrial processes from oil to wastewater to manufacturing. Management believes that the separation technology has applications in most, if not all major separation industries. The unique characteristics of the technology allow it to be utilized either as a stand-alone unit or within an existing system to provide a more efficient and cost effective way to handle the separation needs of the customer. We believe the separation technology can result in a cost savings and other benefits to the customer. These benefits result in and include:
 

● | A reduction in water and energy usage, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Requires no pressure drop to perform separation, 
● | Less space needed to implement the V-Inline Separator, the V-Inline Separator weights less than some competing technologies, 
● | A reduction time to process and separate the fluids, allowing the customer to be more efficient, 
● | Creation of more efficient and faster process to treat water to increase the overall productivity of the end-user, 
● | Fewer employees needed to operate the system, and 
● | Reduction of ongoing maintenance and servicing costs. 

 
We believe that this separation technology is a unique front-end solution for the separation industry that can offer increased productivity while reducing the physical space and energy required to operate the unit. These advantages translate into the potential for substantial operating cost efficiencies that would increase the profitability of the solutions end user. The unique characteristic to conduct separation without a pressure loss allows the unit to be installed in locations other technologies cannot. For instance, another separation technology called a hydrocyclone requires a significant pressure loss to perform separation.
 
Although we have strong beliefs in the potential of the technology, we do not have the funds to successfully market the technology. As such, we have focused our efforts on finding a potential merger or acquisition candidate. During this period we have also marketed our manufacturing capabilities to local South Florida companies.
 
Manufacturing
 
We manufacture and assemble our products at our Fort Lauderdale, Florida facilities. The materials needed to manufacture the components of the products we sell, including the separation technology, have been provided by leading companies in the precision equipment industry. We do not have any long term contracts with any supplier. We do not anticipate any shortage of component parts. We maintain a limited inventory of finished parts until we receive a customer order. Most of our inventory is comprised of raw materials and finished Separator components that can be used for future sales.
Marketing
 
During 2020 and 2021, we limited our marketing and advertising due to COVID-19 and the downturn in the oil and gas markets and lack of available working capital. Although the oil and gas markets have improved, we do not have sufficient funds to market the technology. We anticipate increasing spending on marketing efforts, such as tradeshows, when, and if, our cash flow and market conditions improve. From June 2017 through June 2020, we primarily focused our marketing

resources to develop a strong rapport with Schlumberger, which included scaling up our manufacturing capabilities. In addition, we started to pursue projects in industries outside of the oil and gas market, and primarily marketed our products by developing relationships within the separation markets. Our marketing efforts were compromised as we anticipated using the revenues from the Schlumberger Supply Agreement to invest in new applications and industries for the V-Inline Separator unit sales. However, sales from Schlumberger were lower than management anticipated and the Supply Agreement has expired.
 
We have shifted our near term focus to market our machining capabilities to companies located in South Florida to help stabilize cash flow. During 2022, the Company does not currently have plans to present at any tradeshows.
 
Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, and local laws and substantial regulation by government agencies, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Occupational Safety and Health administration (OSHA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Among other matters, these agencies regulate the operation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials used by us during the normal course of our operations, govern the health and safety of our employees and certain standards and licensing requirements for our aerospace components that we contract manufacture. We are subject to significant compliance burden from this extensive regulatory framework, which may substantially increase our operational costs.
 
We believe that we have been and are in compliance with environmental requirements and believe that we have no liabilities under environmental requirements. Further, we have not spent any funds specifically on compliance with environmental laws. However, some risk of environmental liability is inherent in the nature of our business, and we might incur substantial costs to meet current or more stringent compliance, cleanup, or other obligations pursuant to environmental requirements in the future. This could result in a material adverse effect to our results of operations and financial condition.
 
Product Liability
 
Our business exposes us to possible claims of personal injury, death or property damage, which may result from the failure, or malfunction of any component or subassembly manufactured or assembled by us. However, until we start shipping the V-Inline Separator again, we do not plan to have product liability insurance. Any product liability claim made against us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in light of our poor financial condition, losses and limited revenues. We also maintain general insurance coverage.
Competition
 
We are subject to competition from other manufacturing facilities who have greater manufacturing capacity, which allows them to utilize economy of scale to reduce cost. We are also subject to competition from a number of companies who have greater experience, research abilities, engineering capability and financial resources than we have to market and sell separation technology. Although we believe the separation technology offers applications which accomplish better or similar results on a more cost-effective basis than existing products, other products have, in some instances, attained greater market and regulatory acceptance.
Human Capital
