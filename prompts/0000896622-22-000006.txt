Aptar is headquartered in Crystal Lake, Illinois and has approximately 13,000 dedicated employees in 20 different countries. For more information, visit www.aptar.com.
Our business was started in the late 1940’s, manufacturing and selling aerosol valves in the United States, and has grown primarily through acquisitions and internal expansion. In this report, we may refer to AptarGroup, Inc. and its subsidiaries as “AptarGroup”, “Aptar” or the “Company”.
We have manufacturing facilities located throughout the world including North America, Europe, Asia and South America. We have approximately 5,000 customers with no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounting for greater than 5% of our 2021 Net Sales.
Consumers’ preference for convenience and product differentiation through drug delivery and packaging design and function are important to our customers and they have converted many of their packages from non-dispensing formats to dispensing systems that offer enhanced shelf appeal, convenience, cleanliness and accuracy of dosage. We design our products with both people and the environment in mind. Many of our product solutions for the beauty, personal care, home care, food and beverage markets are recyclable, reusable or made with recycled content.
We partner with our customers by providing innovative delivery systems and a suite of comprehensive services to help them succeed. While we offer a wide variety of services and products, our primary products are dispensing pumps, closures, aerosol valves, elastomeric primary packaging components, active material science solutions and digital health solutions.
Dispensing pumps are finger-actuated dispensing systems that dispense a spray or lotion from non-pressurized containers. The style of pump used depends largely on the nature of the product being dispensed, from small, fine mist pumps used with pharmaceutical products and perfume to lotion pumps for more viscous formulas.
Closures are primarily dispensing closures but to a lesser degree can include non-dispensing closures. Dispensing closures are plastic caps that allow a product to be dispensed without removing the cap.
Aerosol valves dispense product from pressurized containers. The majority of the aerosol valves that we sell are metered dose valves, with the balance being bag-on valve and continuous spray valves.
We also manufacture and sell elastomeric primary packaging components. These components are used in the injectables market. Products include stoppers for infusion, antibiotic, lyophilization and diagnostic vials. Our elastomeric components also include pre-filled syringe components, such as plungers, needle shields, tip caps and cartridges.
We provide active material science solutions using our platform technology to maintain container closure integrity, extend shelf-life, control moisture and protect drug products from overall environmental exposures and degradations. 
The digital health solutions aim to improve patients' treatment experience and outcomes. We leverage connected devices, diagnostic and digital therapeutics tools that support patients to manage their disease as well as enabling care teams to remotely monitor the health of the patients when needed. Available as standalone or as a fully integrated offering in our existing range of drug delivery solutions, we have digital health solutions covering a wide range of therapeutic areas including, but not limited to, pulmonary, oncology, diabetes, immunology, and neurology.
During 2021 and 2020, we acquired several companies to strengthen and broaden our portfolio, including the following business combinations and asset purchases:
-    September - November 2021 – We acquired 100% of the share capital of Voluntis S.A. ("Voluntis") for approximately $89.7 million (net of $3.8 million of cash acquired).

DESCRIPTION OF OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS
INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS
Our organizational structure consists of three market-focused business segments: Pharma, Beauty + Home and Food + Beverage. This is a strategic structure which allows us to be more closely aligned with our customers and the markets in which they operate. We primarily sell our products and services through our own sales force to pharmaceutical, health care, beauty, personal care, home care, food and beverage marketers. To a limited extent, we use independent representatives and distributors to increase our reach to smaller customers and export markets.

2/ATR | 2021 Form 10-K

Operations that sell dispensing systems, drug delivery systems, sealing solutions and services to the prescription drug, consumer health care, injectables, active material science solutions and digital health solutions markets form the Pharma segment. Operations that sell dispensing systems and sealing solutions primarily to the beauty, personal care and home care markets form the Beauty + Home segment. Operations that sell dispensing systems, sealing solutions and food service trays to the food and beverage markets form the Food + Beverage segment. Each of these three business segments is described more fully below.
PHARMA
Our Pharma segment accounts for 65% of our Adjusted EBITDA excluding non-allocated corporate costs, and is our second largest segment in terms of net sales and our largest segment in terms of total assets, representing 40% and 44% of our Net Sales and Total Assets, respectively, in 2021. We are a leading supplier of nasal drug delivery spray pumps and metered dose inhaler valves (“MDIs”) to the pharmaceutical and health care markets worldwide and we are an important supplier of elastomer for injectable primary packaging components worldwide. Characteristics of this market include (i) governmental regulation of our pharmaceutical customers, (ii) contaminant-controlled manufacturing environments and (iii) a significant amount of time and research from initially working with pharmaceutical companies at the molecular development stage of a medication through the eventual distribution to the market. We have clean-room manufacturing facilities in Argentina, China, France, Germany, India, Switzerland and the United States. We believe that providing value-added, convenient drug delivery and dispensing systems will continue to offer opportunities for our business. In addition, we believe there are opportunities for growth in the over-the-counter and generic pharmaceutical categories.
Prescription Drug. Sales to the prescription drug market accounted for approximately 42% of the segment’s total net sales in 2021. Pumps sold to the prescription drug market deliver medications nasally, orally or topically. Currently the majority of our pumps sold are for nasal allergy treatments. Sales of pumps to deliver prescription allergy medicine that is now available over-the-counter remains part of our prescription drug division. Our nasal pumps and unit dose and bidose devices are also used to deliver liquid and powder pain management and central nervous system therapies. 
MDIs are used for dispensing precise amounts of aerosolized medication. This technology allows medication to be broken up into very fine particles, which enables the drug to be delivered typically via the pulmonary route. Currently the majority of our MDIs sold are used for respiratory ailments such as asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
We continue to develop new drug delivery and dispensing systems and accessories in this segment. While we expect that these types of new products will come to market in the future, it is difficult to estimate when, as the rigors of pharmaceutical regulations affect the timing of product introductions by our pharmaceutical customers that use our drug delivery and dispensing systems.
Consumer Health Care. Sales to the consumer health care market accounted for approximately 23% of the segment’s total net sales in 2021. Many product applications for this market are similar to the prescription market; however, these product applications are sold over-the-counter without a prescription. Typical consumer health care spray product applications include nasal decongestants, nasal salines and cough and cold product applications. Typical consumer health care valve product applications include nasal saline using our bag-on valve technology. We have developed a multi dose ophthalmic dispensing device suitable for unpreserved formulations. This technology is successfully marketed in Europe, North America and Latin America and is under development for other markets both for over-the-counter and prescription product applications. Other products sold to this market include airless pump systems for dermal drug delivery product applications. We have recently seen a trend to more child resistant and senior-friendly packaging solutions and have developed products to meet these market needs.
Injectables. Sales to the injectables market accounted for approximately 22% of the segment’s total net sales in 2021. Injectables are elastomeric primary packaging components that assist with the administration of injected medicines. Injectable products offered include stoppers for vials and pre-filled syringe components, such as plungers, needle shields, tip caps and components for cartridges. Our recent capital investment commitments in this business will enable us to market coated stoppers which better protect the contents of the vial and the integrity of biologic formulations. Pharmaceutical applications for this market include vaccines, anti-thrombotic, small molecules and biologics.
Active Material Science Solutions. Sales of active material science solutions products accounted for approximately 13% of the segment’s total net sales in 2021. The platform technology is integrated into at-home COVID-19 test kits to protect against moisture and protect the integrity of the test kits. Our Activ-Film™ solution leverages proprietary platform technology to ensure accurate readings and improve shelf life.
In addition, Aptar's material science platform technology is used to protect oral solid dose drugs, transdermal drug delivery, medical devices and probiotics. It can be engineered to absorb moisture, emit aromas, reduce pathogens, or scavenge odor, oxygen or volatile organic compounds.

Digital Health Solutions. Aptar began serving the digital health market in the fourth quarter of 2021 with the acquisition of Voluntis. Additionally, Cohero Health sales will be reported within the digital health solutions market going forward. Sales to the digital health market accounted for less than 1% of the segment's total net sales in 2021 and are expected to increase in 2022 given a full year of Voluntis sales will be included in our consolidated revenues. The digital health solutions we provide improve patients' treatment, experience and outcomes. We leverage connected devices, diagnostics and digital therapeutic tools that support patients to manage their disease as well as enabling care teams to remotely monitor the health of the patients when needed. Available as standalone or as a fully integrated offering in our existing range of drug delivery solutions, we have digital health solutions covering a wide range of therapeutic areas including, but not limited to, pulmonary, oncology, diabetes, immunology and neurology.
BEAUTY + HOME
Our Beauty + Home segment accounts for 23% of our Adjusted EBITDA excluding non-allocated corporate costs, and is our largest segment in terms of net sales and our second largest in terms of total assets, representing 44% and 39% of our Net Sales and Total Assets, respectively, in 2021. The Beauty + Home segment primarily sells pumps and decorative components to the beauty market and pumps, closures, aerosol valves, accessories and sealing solutions to the personal care and home care markets. We believe we are a leading supplier for the majority of the products we sell primarily to the beauty and personal care markets.
Beauty. Sales to the beauty market accounted for approximately 49% of the segment’s total net sales in 2021. The beauty market requires a broad range of spray and lotion pumps, closures, elastomeric flow-control components and sampling dispensing systems to meet functional as well as aesthetic requirements. A considerable amount of research and coordination with our customers is required to qualify a pump for use with their products. Within the market, we expect the use of pumps to continue to increase, particularly in the cosmetics and sampling sectors. In the cosmetic sector, packaging for certain products such as natural and organic cosmetics and anti-aging lotions continue to provide us with growth opportunities. We are a leading provider of packaging solutions for prestige and mass market fragrance products. Our cosmetic lotion pumps, airless dispensing systems, lotion sampling devices and decorative capabilities along with our focus on color cosmetics including lip stick and lip gloss products will also provide growth opportunities. We see significant opportunities for growth in the sale of our products for cosmetic skin care and color cosmetic product applications in Asia.
Personal Care. Sales to the personal care market accounted for approximately 43% of the segment’s total net sales in 2021 and primarily included sales of lotion pumps, closures, fine mist spray pumps, continuous spray aerosol valves and elastomeric flow-control components. Personal care lotion pump product applications include hand sanitizers, soaps, cleaners and skin moisturizers. Personal care closures product applications include hand sanitizers, shampoos and conditioners. Typical spray pump product applications include hair care, body care and sun care products. Personal care continuous spray aerosol valve product applications include hair care products, deodorants, shaving creams and sun care products. Our research and development teams continue to design unique accessories that increase the value of our continuous spray aerosol valve offerings.

Examples of beverage products currently utilizing dispensing closures include bottled water, sport and energy drinks, juices and concentrated water flavorings.
GENERAL BUSINESS INFORMATION
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our commitment to innovation, one of our competitive strengths, has resulted in an emphasis on research and development directed toward developing affordable, new, sustainable and innovative packaging, drug delivery solutions and connected devices and adapting existing products for new markets or customer requirements. In certain cases, our customers share in the research and development expenses of customer initiated projects. Occasionally, we acquire or license from third parties technologies or products that are in various stages of development.
PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
We customarily seek patent and trademark protection for our products and brands. We own and currently have numerous product applications pending for patents and trademarks in many regions of the world. In addition, certain of our products are produced under patent licenses granted by third parties. We believe that we possess certain technical capabilities and know-how that make our products difficult for a competitor to duplicate. While valuable to our overall product portfolio, sales of any one individually patented product are not considered material to any specific segment or to our consolidated results.
TECHNOLOGY
We have technical expertise regarding injection molding, robotics, clean-room facilities and high-speed assembly. We also have expertise regarding the formulation and finishing of elastomer and silicone components. In addition, we offer a variety of sterilization options for elastomeric components and active material science solutions based on proprietary material science expertise. Pumps and aerosol valves require the assembly of several different plastic, metal and rubber components using high-speed equipment. When molding dispensing closures, or plastic components to be used in pump or aerosol valve products, we use advanced plastic injection molding technology, including large cavitation plastic injection molds. We are able to mold within tolerances as small as one one-thousandth of an inch and we assemble products in a high-speed, cost-effective manner. We also provide analytical and connected device expertise within our pharma service technology businesses. 
MANUFACTURING AND SOURCING
The majority of our worldwide production is located outside of the United States. Our philosophy is to produce as much as possible in the region where it will be sold. In order to augment capacity and to maximize internal capacity utilization (particularly for plastic injection molding), we use subcontractors to supply certain plastic and metal components. Certain suppliers of these components have unique technical abilities that make us dependent on them, particularly for aerosol valve and pump production. The principal raw materials used in our production are plastic resins, silicone, rubber and certain metal products. We believe an adequate supply of such raw materials is available from existing and alternative sources. We attempt to offset cost increases through improving productivity and developing new, higher margin solutions and increasing selling prices, as allowed by market conditions or contractual commitments. We source certain materials, especially some resins and rubber components for our pharmaceutical segment, from a single source. Significant delays in receiving these components or discontinuance of an approved raw material would require us to seek alternative sources, which could result in higher costs as well as impact our ability to supply products in the short-term. We believe we have adequate safety stock to mitigate any significant supply concerns.
CUSTOMERS
We have approximately 5,000 customers with no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounting for greater than 5% of 2021 Net Sales. 
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
We are geographically diverse with manufacturing and sales operations in Asia, Europe, Latin America (including Mexico) and North America. Europe is our largest region in terms of sales, where sales (including exports) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately 53% and 55%, respectively, of our consolidated sales. Asia and Latin America when aggregated represented approximately 13% and 12% of our consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Export sales from the United States were $204.6 million and $179.0 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We are a net exporter of goods from Europe and a net importer of goods to the North American, Asian and Latin American regions.

5/ATR | 2021 Form 10-K

FOREIGN CURRENCY
Because of our international presence, movements in exchange rates have a significant impact on the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign exchange exposure is to the euro, but we have foreign exchange exposure to the Chinese yuan, Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Swiss franc and other Asian, European and South American currencies. A strengthening U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies has a dilutive translation effect on our financial statements. Conversely, a weakening U.S. dollar has an additive effect. We manage our exposures to foreign exchange principally with forward exchange contracts to economically hedge recorded transactions and firm purchase and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
EMPLOYEE AND LABOR RELATIONS
Human Capital. Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, our human resource programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit and incentive programs; enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; and evolve and invest in technology, tools and resources to enable employees at work.
As of December 31, 2021, Aptar has approximately 13,000 full-time employees. Of the full-time employees, approximately 8,000 are located in Europe, 2,600 are located in Asia and South America and the remaining 2,400 are located in North America. The majority of our European and Latin American employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements made at either the local or national level in their respective countries. The total labor force covered by a collective bargaining agreement represents 55% of the total employee population. Termination of employees at certain of our international operations could be costly due to local regulations regarding severance benefits. There were no material work stoppages in 2021 and management considers our employee relations to be satisfactory.
We have experienced competition for talent, wage inflation and pressure to improve workplace conditions and benefits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, within certain geographical locations we have experienced a labor shortage due to the decline of qualified talent and absenteeism from the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher employee turnover levels or our failure to attract and retain talent in a timely manner could impact our future results. 
Employee Engagement. At Aptar, we conduct annual leadership for growth surveys. We have focused on organizational development based on our leadership principles, core values and strategic priorities. Our goal is to ensure that Aptar is well positioned for long-term growth and that we continue to be a high-performing, values-based, customer-focused company, with active commitments to innovation and sustainability. 
Employee Development & Leadership Succession. Developing our employees to reach their full potential is an integral part of our Core Values. We have a strong foundation of learning and development systems and leadership programs at our Corporate University. Our leadership programs are targeted at all levels of the organization, from early career to senior leadership globally. Our program offerings also include many specialized programs such as change management, manufacturing and operational leadership, technical skills and others. Aptar also has developed and deployed an integrated talent management system that includes annual talent reviews, three tiered succession planning, and individual development planning. Promotions from within provide career growth opportunities for our employees.
Diversity & Inclusion. At AptarGroup, our goal is to promote a diverse and inclusive culture. Women comprise 40% of the Board of Directors, and 67% of Board Committee chairs are women. During 2021, we created a Global Director of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion role and continued to roll-out Diversity & Inclusion training. Women comprise approximately 36% of the global employee population and approximately 20% of senior leadership. In 2020, Aptar launched a global Women's Employee Resource Group with a focus on increasing women in leadership. Aptar is included in the SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE) which invests in companies that rank among the highest in gender diversity within senior leadership. Aptar is also a participant in the Catalyst CEO Champions for Change and the Gender and Diversity KPI Alliance. In 2021, Aptar launched a new Black/African American and/or African descent employee resource group and a new employee resource group for the LBGTQ+ community. In November 2021, Aptar was named a Global Top 10 Female-Friendly Company by Forbes.
Employee Well-being & Safety. Employee safety and well-being is a primary focus of Aptar and was of particular interest during 2021 in light of the continued COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, we have taken a variety of measures to ensure the availability and functioning of our critical infrastructure, to promote the safety and security of our employees, and to support the communities in which we operate. These measures include requiring remote working arrangements for employees where practicable and implementing new safety protocols. We are following public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions, the promotion of social distancing and the adoption of work-from-home arrangements. Additionally, we expanded employee assistance and mindfulness programs globally to help employees and their families manage anxiety, stress and overall well-being. 

6/ATR | 2021 Form 10-K

COMPETITION
All of the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we continue to experience price competition in all product lines and markets. Competitors include privately and publicly held entities that range from regional to international companies. We expect the market for our products to remain competitive, as consolidation among our competitors is increasing in the current economic climate. We believe our competitive advantages are consistent high levels of innovation, quality and service, geographic diversity, financial strength and stability and breadth of products and services. Our manufacturing strength lies in the ability to mold complex plastic components and formulate and finish elastomer and silicone components in a cost-effective manner and to assemble products at high speeds. Our business is somewhat capital intensive and it is becoming more important to our customers that we have global manufacturing capabilities. Both of these serve as barriers to entry for new competitors wanting to enter our business. Furthermore, within our Pharma business, increasing regulatory hurdles present a challenge for new competitors to enter the market.
While we have experienced some competition in Europe, Latin America and the United States from low cost Asian suppliers, particularly in the beauty and personal care market, this has not been significant. Although using low cost Asian suppliers may have a cost advantage, more and more customers prefer local suppliers citing shorter lead times, higher reactivity and service, and stronger safety of supply. We have also reduced our carbon footprint due to the increased use of lower-carbon fuels within some of our shipping lanes, which we see as a competitive advantage.
ENVIRONMENT & SUSTAINABILITY
Our manufacturing operations primarily involve plastic injection molding, automated assembly processes, elastomer and silicone formulation and finishing and, to a limited degree, metal anodization and vacuum metallization of plastic components. Historically, the environmental impact of these processes has been minimal, and we believe we meet current environmental standards in all material respects. To date, our manufacturing operations have not been significantly affected by environmental laws and regulations relating to the environment.
In 2020, we formalized our science-based targets, setting a Scope 1 + Scope 2 emissions reduction goal consistent with requirements to keep global warming well-below 2° Celsius by year 2030, and a Scope 3 reduction goal consistent with requirements to keep global warming at 2° Celsius by year 2030. This science-based approach incorporates our own operations and operations within the value chain. In addition, we annually undergo data assurance as part of our sustainability reporting. This assurance process allows for data on consumption of electricity, fuel oil, and natural gas and renewable energy purchases to be verified for accuracy and completeness by an external organization. Globally this process is certified to the ISO 14064 standard for energy and greenhouse gas emission reporting.
Compared to our 2019 baseline, Aptar has made progress cutting emissions, and continues efforts to mitigate climate risks and further the low-carbon economy, as reported by the Company through global environmental non-profit CDP's 2021 climate change questionnaire. Through significant, demonstrable action on climate change, we believe Aptar is leading on corporate environmental ambition, action and transparency worldwide. Aptar was named to the CDP Supplier Engagement Leaderboard in both 2020 and 2021.
There continues to be increased interest and awareness from consumers and our customers in environmentally sustainable products, especially through the sourcing of sustainable materials. We are focused on reducing our environmental impacts through product life cycle assessments, sustainable material trials, operational eco-efficiency initiatives and renewable energy sourcing. We have teams dedicated to designing for sustainability by providing products that improve recyclability and use less material. Aptar has launched products and components in North America, Europe and Asia made with post-consumer recycled resins (PCR) and continues to explore additional opportunities for alternative resins and recyclable products.
We are actively collaborating with our customers on reliable products by supporting our customers’ participation in the circular e-commerce platform called Loop in addition to being an investor in Loop ourselves. We also invested in and partnered with PureCycle Technologies, to prepare for the introduction of Ultra-Pure Recycled Polypropylene (UPRP) into dispensing product applications.
Connecting with other companies through organizations like Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) provides an invaluable opportunity to share best practices and work on larger projects with aligned objectives towards a more circular economy.
In April 2021, Aptar was named among JUST Capital's Top 10 Companies Leading on Reducing Environmental Impact, which examined several different metrics including carbon emissions, pollution reduction, and other industry-specific sustainability metrics. In January 2022, Aptar was ranked in the top 20 overall, and first in our industry, for the category of Leading on Environmental Impact within JUST Capital's America's Most JUST Companies 2022. In November 2021, Aptar was ranked first on the Forbes Green Growth 50 list, which ranked companies based on their ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while simultaneously growing earnings. In December 2021, Aptar was named one of America's Most Responsible Companies 2022 by Newsweek, ranked #10 out of 500 U.S. companies, and ranked first in our industry category. In January 2022, Aptar received a Platinum Sustainability Rating for 2021 from EcoVadis. In February 2022, Aptar was named to CDP's 2021 Supplier Engagement Leaderboard in recognition of our efforts to measure and reduce climate risk within our supply chain.

Future regulations on environmental matters regarding recycling or material inputs could impact our business.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Certain of our products are directly or indirectly affected by government regulation. The European Union has adopted a circular economy package. The package maps out a series of actions planned over several years. Some actions have resulted in regulations aimed to reduce marine litter, increase plastic recycling rates, prohibit single-use plastic packaging and introduce new taxes in relation to the end-of-life management of packaging. In Europe and in parts of the United States (including California), regulations require food and beverage companies to tether plastic caps to ensure the caps stay with the package, thus improving the likelihood the caps will enter the recycling stream. The EU and the United States are planning new regulation to ban perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) materials used in the packaging industry. The potential exists for these types of regulations to expand worldwide. We have established an innovation team that focuses on designing for and converting into more sustainable options like post-consumer recycled resin and Food and Drug Administration approved resin alternatives. We are designing for sustainability by providing products that improve recyclability, use sustainable material and use less material, and we offer multiple tethered options. Our new product offerings include: Purity Lite, a mono-material, lightweight, fully-recyclable closure; SimpliCycle, an award winning recyclable valve; and Future, a mono-material, fully-recyclable pump. We are also partnering with global and regional thought leaders to drive a more circular economy.
On October 15, 2016, 197 countries adopted an amendment to phase down hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) propellants in order to reduce greenhouse gas emission under the Montreal Protocol in Kigali, Rwanda. Under the amendment, countries committed to cut the production and consumption by more than 80% over the next 30 years. This type of propellant is used for pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDI). The phase down plan has an exemption for pharmaceutical product applications of pMDIs; however, customers are looking for alternative propellants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are working with the suppliers of these alternative propellants and our customers to develop new solutions.
Pharma regulatory agencies in the United States and European Union have developed and introduced Combination Products specific guidelines for more complex drug delivery products, including dispensing systems. These guidelines have increased the complexity of the registration process for these products and recognize the existence of a device part in the drug delivery product, which now is required to be appropriately designed, developed and documented.
Future government regulations could include healthcare cost containment policies. For example, reviews by various governments to determine the number of drugs, or prices thereof, that will be paid by their insurance systems could affect future sales of our pharmaceutical customers’ products and thus adversely impact our sales to these customers. Such regulation could adversely affect prices of and demand for our pharmaceutical products. We believe that the focus on the cost effectiveness of the use of medications as compared to surgery and hospitalization provides us with an opportunity to expand sales to the pharmaceutical market.
