BUSINESS OF FFBW, INC.
 
FFBW, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under federal law on October 10, 2017 as part of the mutual holding company reorganization of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin, for the purpose of becoming the savings and loan holding company of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin. Since being incorporated, other than holding the common stock of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin, retaining approximately 50% of the net cash proceeds of the stock conversion offering and making a loan to the employee stock ownership plan of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin, we have not engaged in any business activities to date.
 
The Company is authorized to pursue business activities permitted by applicable laws and regulations, which may include the acquisition of banking and financial services companies. See “Supervision and Regulation – Holding Company Regulation” for a discussion of the activities that are permitted for savings and loan holding companies. We currently have no understandings or agreements to acquire other financial institutions, although we may determine to do so in the future. We may also borrow funds including for reinvestment in First Federal Bank of Wisconsin.
 
Our cash flow depends on earnings from the investment of the net proceeds we retained from our initial public stock offering that was consummated in October 2017, and any dividends we receive from First Federal Bank of Wisconsin. We neither own nor lease any property, but pay a fee to First Federal Bank of Wisconsin for the use of its premises, equipment and furniture. At the present time, we employ only persons who are officers of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin who also serve as officers of FFBW. We use the support staff of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin from time to time and pay a fee to First Federal Bank of Wisconsin for the time devoted to FFBW by employees of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin. However, these persons are not separately compensated by FFBW. FFBW may hire additional employees, as appropriate, to the extent it expands its business in the future.
 

BUSINESS OF FIRST FEDERAL BANK OF WISCONSIN 
 
General
 
First Federal Bank of Wisconsin is a federally chartered stock savings bank, with its home office in Waukesha, Wisconsin, which is in Waukesha County, located in southeastern Wisconsin approximately 18 miles west of Milwaukee. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin was originally organized in 1922, and has operated continuously in the Milwaukee metropolitan area since that time. In May 2014, we merged with Bay View Federal Savings and Loan Association (“Bay View Federal”), a federal mutual saving association located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with approximately $135 million in assets as of the May 17, 2014 closing date of the merger. In the merger, Bay View Federal’s sole office located in the Bay View neighborhood of Milwaukee became a branch office of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin, thereby expanding our presence into Milwaukee County.
 
From our founding in 1922 until 2006, we operated as a traditional thrift institution, offering primarily residential mortgage loans and savings accounts. Beginning in 2006, we expanded our loan operations and began offering commercial products. Our commercial loan offerings have increased significantly in the last decade, including through our merger in 2014 with Bay View Federal.
 
 6


In July 2016, we hired our current president and chief executive officer, Edward H. Schaefer, and since this time we have conducted an extensive review of our credit, underwriting, information technology and compliance operations. Under the leadership of Mr. Schaefer, we believe that we have significantly upgraded our loan operations, policies, procedures and controls. Among other areas, we have enhanced our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending infrastructure and have recently added a new senior vice president of commercial lending. Additionally, consistent with our strategy to grow our commercial loan operations, we have enhanced our suite of deposit products in order to accommodate business customers, and thereby grow our core deposits.
 
Subject to market conditions, we expect to continue to increase our focus on originating commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans to continue to diversify our overall loan portfolio, increase the overall yield earned on our loans and assist in managing interest rate risk. We also invest in securities, which have historically consisted of mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises, municipal securities, corporate debt securities and U.S. government and agency securities. We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, savings accounts, health savings accounts and certificate of deposit accounts. Additionally, we have used advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and brokered certificates of deposit to fund our operations.
 
In October 2017, we consummated our reorganization in to a mutual holding company structure whereby First Federal Bank of Wisconsin became a stock bank and the wholly owned subsidiary of FFBW, Inc. Concurrently with this reorganization, FFBW, Inc. sold 44.6% of its stock to the general public, including First Federal Bank of Wisconsin’s employee stock ownership plan, and issued 55.0% of its stock to FFBW, MHC, our top tier mutual holding company. Additionally, as part of the reorganization, we established a charitable foundation called FFBW Community Foundation and funded it with $250,000 in cash and 25,000 shares. The purpose of this foundation is to make contributions to support various charitable organizations operating in our community now and in the future.

Market Area 
 
We conduct our operations from our three full-service banking offices in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, which is located immediately west of Milwaukee, and our office in the Bay View neighborhood on Milwaukee’s south side. We consider our primary lending market area to be southeastern Wisconsin, however, we occasionally make loans secured by properties located outside of our primary lending market, usually to borrowers with whom we have an existing relationship and who have a presence within our primary market.
 
Waukesha County contains a diverse cross section of employment sectors, with a mix of services, manufacturing, wholesale/retail trade, federal and local government, health care facilities and finance-related employment. Waukesha County had an estimated population of 400,000 as of July 2017. The Bay View neighborhood of Milwaukee is a more urban community located in the southern portion of the city of Milwaukee.

Waukesha County is primarily a suburban community and is the second wealthiest county in Wisconsin. According to the United States Census, from 2013 through 2017:
 

● | the median household income in Waukesha County was $81,000 compared to a median household income for Wisconsin of $57,000;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The median home value was $263,000, compared to $169,000 in Wisconsin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approximately 42.9% of the population of Waukesha County held a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to 29.0% of Wisconsin; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approximately 4.8% of the population of Waukesha County had incomes below the poverty level, compared to 11.3% of Wisconsin.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
We face significant competition within our market both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies.
 
As of June 30, 2018 (the latest date for which information is available), our market share was 0.99% of total deposits in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, making us the 21st largest out of 35 banks in Waukesha County. Our market share was 0.12% of total deposits in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, making us the 23rd largest out of 28 banks in Milwaukee County.
 
Lending Activities
 
Our lending focus was historically originating 1-4 family owner-occupied residential real estate loans, 1-4 family investor-owned residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and multifamily loans. We are putting more focus on also originate commercial and industrial loans, commercial development loans and consumer loans. Subject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we expect to continue to increase our focus on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending, in an effort to diversify our overall loan portfolio and increase the overall yield earned on our loans.
 
Since 2016, we have hired a new president and chief executive officer who has extensive commercial lending experience and as well as a new senior vice president of commercial lending. Additionally, we continually enhance our underwriting policies and procedures. We believe that these enhanced policies and procedures will further our business strategy of growing our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loan portfolios while maintaining a strong credit and underwriting culture.
 
We sell the majority of the fixed-rate conforming and eligible jumbo 1-4 family owner-occupied residential real estate loans that we originate, generally on a servicing-released basis, with limited or no recourse, while retaining non-eligible jumbo fixed-rate and adjustable-rate 1-4 family owner-occupied residential real estate loans in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio.

1-4 Family Owner-Occupied Residential Real Estate Lending. At December 31, 2018, we had $41.0 million of loans secured by 1-4 family owner-occupied residential real estate, representing 20.4% of our total loan portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2018, we had $679,000 of residential mortgages held for sale. We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate 1-4 family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2018, 47.6% of our 1-4 family owner-occupied residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans, and 52.4% of such loans were adjustable-rate loans.
 
 10


Our fixed-rate 1-4 family residential real estate loans typically have terms of 10 to 30 years and are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae guidelines when the loan balance meets such guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which as of December 31, 2018 was $453,100 for single-family homes in our market area. We typically sell, servicing-released, our conforming and eligible jumbo fixed-rate 1-4 family owner-occupied residential real estate loans. We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which are referred to as “jumbo loans” that we retain in our portfolio. Jumbo loans that we originate typically have 15 to 30 year terms and maximum loan-to-value ratios of 80%. At December 31, 2018, we had $16.5 million in jumbo loans, which represented 40.1% of our 1-4 family owner-occupied residential real estate loans. Our average loan size for jumbo loans was $658,000 at December 31, 2018. Virtually all of our 1-4 family residential real estate loans are secured by properties located in Waukesha County or Milwaukee County, Wisconsin.
 
We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our mortgage loans without private mortgage insurance to 85% of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower. Loans where the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance may be made with loan-to-value ratios up to 100%.
 
Our adjustable-rate 1-4 family residential real estate loans carry terms to maturity ranging from 10 to 30 years and generally have fixed rates for initial terms of five years, although we also offer terms of three or seven years, and adjust annually thereafter at a margin, which in recent years has been tied to a margin above the 12-month Treasury rate. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2% per adjustment period, with a lifetime interest rate cap of generally 6% over the initial interest rate of the loan and a rate floor. We typically hold in our loan portfolio our adjustable-rate 1-4 family residential real estate loans.
 
Although adjustable-rate mortgage loans may reduce to an extent our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they periodically re-price, as interest rates increase the required payments due from the borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by our maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments. Moreover, the interest rates on most of our adjustable-rate loans do not adjust for up to five years after origination. As a result, the effectiveness of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in compensating for changes in general interest rates may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates.
 
We do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on permanent 1-4 family residential real estate loans (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not have a “subprime lending” program for 1-4 family residential real estate loans (i.e., loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories).
 
Generally, residential mortgage loans that we originate include “due-on-sale” clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance for the benefit of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin. We also require homeowner’s insurance and fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance on properties securing real estate loans.

1-4 Family Investor-Owned Residential Real Estate Lending. At December 31, 2018, we had $32.3 million of loans secured by 1-4 family investor-owned residential real estate, representing 16.1% of our total loan portfolio. 1-4 family investor-owned residential real estate loans are underwritten pursuant to our commercial lending underwriting criteria. Generally, we require personal guarantees from the borrowers on these properties, and we will not make loans in excess of 80% loan to value on non-owner-occupied properties.
 
We believe that there is a greater credit risk inherent in investor-owned residential properties than in owner-occupied 1-4 family residential real estate loans since, similar to commercial real estate and multifamily loans, the repayment of these loans may depend, in part, on the successful management of the property and/or the borrower’s ability to lease the units of the property. In addition, the physical condition of investor-owned properties is often below that of owner-occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which has a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties.
 
Multifamily Residential Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2018, multifamily residential real estate loans were $34.5 million, or 17.2%, of our total loan portfolio. Our multifamily residential real estate loans are generally secured by properties consisting of five or more rental units in our market area. In addition to originating these loans, we also purchase and participate in multifamily residential real estate loans from other financial institutions. Such loans are independently underwritten according to our policies and require satisfactory documentation review by our legal counsel before we will purchase or participate in such loans. We believe our enhanced credit underwriting and loan administration policies and procedures should address these risks.
 
We originate a variety of adjustable-rate multifamily residential real estate loans with terms and amortization periods generally up to 25 years, which may include balloon loans. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate generally are indexed to the prime rate plus a margin. We generally include pre-payment penalties on multi-family residential real estate loans we originate.
 
In underwriting multifamily residential real estate loans, we consider a number of factors, which include the projected net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum of 115%), the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar properties. Multifamily residential real estate loans are generally originated in amounts up to 75% of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property securing the loan, whichever is lower. When circumstances warrant, guarantees are obtained from multifamily residential real estate customers. In addition, the borrower’s and guarantor’s financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates.
 
If we foreclose on a multifamily residential real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be a lengthy process with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial.
 
At December 31, 2018, our largest multifamily residential real estate loan had an outstanding balance of $3.8 million and was secured by an apartment complex. At December 31, 2018, this loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms.

Commercial Real Estate Lending. Consistent with our strategy to diversify our loan portfolio and increase our yield, we are focused on increasing our origination of commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2018, we had $69.4 million in commercial real estate loans, representing 34.6% of our total loan portfolio.  Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by office and industrial buildings, warehouses, small retail facilities and restaurants and other special purpose commercial properties, primarily in southeastern Wisconsin.
 
Our commercial real estate loans generally have initial terms of five to ten years and amortization terms of 15 to 20 years, with a balloon payment at the end of the initial term, and may be fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loans. Our adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans are generally tied to a margin above the prime rate. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate loans is generally 80% of the lower of cost or appraised value of the property securing the loan.
 
At December 31, 2018, the average loan size of our outstanding commercial real estate loans was $655,000, and the largest of such loans was a $4.3 million loan secured by a hotel. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31, 2018.
 
We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including project-level and global cash flows, credit history, and management expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). We generally require a debt service ratio of at least 1.15x. All commercial real estate loans of $250,000 or more are appraised by outside independent appraisers.
 
Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial real estate loans. We require property and casualty insurance and flood insurance if the property is determined to be in a flood zone area.
 
Commercial real estate loans entail greater credit risks compared to 1-4 family owner-occupied residential real estate loans because they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than residential properties.
 
Commercial and Industrial Lending. At December 31, 2018, we had $13.1 million of commercial and industrial loans, representing 6.4% of our total loan portfolio. We originate commercial and industrial loans and lines of credit secured by non-real estate business assets. These loans are generally originated to small businesses in our primary market area. Our commercial and industrial loans are generally used by the borrowers for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment, inventory or furniture, and are primarily secured by business assets other than real estate, such as business equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. Our commercial and industrial loans are generally term loans with terms of three to seven years and lines of credit with terms of one to two years, with a target loan size of $250,000 to $3.0 million. Our commercial and industrial lines of credit are generally priced on an adjustable-rate basis tied to the prime rate. Term loans are generally priced at a spread over the comparable term Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago rate. We generally obtain personal guarantees with commercial and industrial loans.

At December 31, 2018, the average loan size of our outstanding commercial and industrial loans was $183,000, and our largest outstanding commercial and industrial loan balance was a $1.3 million loan to a graphics company. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31, 2018.
 
We typically originate commercial and industrial loans on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business, the experience and stability of the borrower’s management team, earnings projections and their underlying assumptions, and the value and marketability of any collateral securing the loan. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial and industrial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment in our market area. Therefore, commercial and industrial loans that we originate have greater credit risk than 1-4 family residential real estate loans. In addition, commercial and industrial loans often result in larger outstanding balances to single borrowers, or related groups of borrowers, and also generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts.
 
As commercial and industrial loans typically help to drive deposit growth, we are increasing our focus on growing this segment of the  loan portfolio. This will also improve diversification and increase loan portfolio yield.
 
Commercial Development Loans. At December 31, 2018, we had $7.8 million, or 3.9% of our total loan portfolio, in commercial development loans. Our commercial development loans may be made for the construction and development of both 1-4 family residential real estate and commercial real estate projects. Our commercial development loans generally have initial terms of up to 36 months, during which the borrower pays interest only. Upon completion of construction, these loans convert to permanent loans. Our commercial development loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent commercial real estate loans, and have rates and terms comparable to commercial real estate loans that we originate. The maximum loan-to-value of our commercial construction loans is 65% of the lesser of the appraised value of the completed property or the contract price for the land plus the value of the improvements. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin requires detailed cost estimates to complete the project and an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. Each property is inspected before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection based on the percentage of completion method. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance, property and casualty insurance, and, if the property is determined to be located in a flood zone area, flood insurance. At December 31, 2018, the unadvanced portion of total commercial development loans totaled $9.1 million. At December 31, 2018, our largest commercial development loan had a balance of $1.9 million and was secured by a multifamily complex construction project and was performing in accordance with its repayment terms.
 
Commercial development financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a commercial development loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Commercial development loans also expose us to the risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated.
 
Consumer Lending. To a much lesser extent, we offer a variety of consumer loans to individuals who reside or work in our market area, including home equity lines of credit, new and used automobile loans, boat loans, recreational vehicle loans and loans secured by certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2018, our consumer loan portfolio totaled $2.7 million, or 1.4% of our total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2018, we had no unsecured consumer loans.
 
 14


Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities.
 
Originations, Sales and Purchases of Loans
 
Most of our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel operating at our banking office locations. While we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and the pricing levels as set in the local marketplace by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of real estate loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume of our real estate loan originations can vary from period to period.
 
We consider our balance sheet as well as market conditions on an ongoing basis in making decisions as to whether to hold loans we originate for investment or to sell such loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we sold $13.0 million and $14.4 million of 1-4 family owner-occupied residential real estate loans. Subject to market and economic conditions, management intends to continue this sales activity in future periods to generate gain on sale income.
 
From time to time, we may purchase loan participations secured by properties within and outside of our primary lending market area in which we are not the lead lender. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. At December 31, 2018, we had seven loans with an aggregate balance of $12.0 million in which we were not the lead lender, all of which were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms. We also have participated out portions of loans that exceeded our loans-to-one borrower legal lending limit and for risk diversification. At December 31, 2018 we had participated out portions of five loans with an aggregate amount of $7.2 million. Historically, we have not purchased whole loans, however, pursuant to our growth strategy, we may purchase whole loans in the future.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority
 
Pursuant to federal law, the aggregate amount of loans that First Federal Bank of Wisconsin is permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15% of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin’s unimpaired capital and surplus (25% if the amount in excess of 15% is secured by “readily marketable collateral” or 30% for certain residential development loans).  At December 31, 2018, based on the 15% limitation, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin’s loans-to-one-borrower limit was approximately $7.6 million.  On the same date, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin had no borrowers with outstanding balances in excess of this amount. At December 31, 2018, our largest loan relationship with one borrower was for $5.8 million, which was secured by a commercial office building, commercial vehicles, 1-4 family investor-owned properties and commercial development properties, and the underlying loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms on that date. 
 
Our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures.  Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that we obtain, and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers approved by our board of directors.  The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items on the application are verified through use of credit reports, bank statements and tax returns. 
 
All loan approval amounts are based on the aggregate loans, including total balances of outstanding loans and the proposed loan to the individual borrower and any related entity. Our president and chief executive officer has individual authorization to approve loans up to $2.0 million.  Our senior vice president of commercial lending has individual authorization to approve loans up to $1.0 million.  Our Officers Loan Committee, which consists of our president and chief executive officer, senior vice president of commercial lending, and all loan officers, can approve loans up to $3.0 million in the aggregate.  Our Board Credit Committee, which consists of our president and chief executive officer, chief lending officer, and three outside directors can approve loans up to $5.0 million. Loans in excess of $5.0 million require the approval of our full board of directors.
 
Generally, we require title insurance or abstracts on our mortgage loans as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property, depending on the type of loan.
 
Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets 
 
Delinquency Procedures. When a loan payment becomes 15 days past due, we contact the customer by mailing a late notice, and loan officers may contact their customers. If a loan payment becomes 30 days past due, we mail an additional late notice and a loan-specific letter written by a collection representative, and we also place telephone calls to the borrower. These loan collection efforts continue until a loan becomes 90 days past due, at which point we would refer the loan for foreclosure proceedings unless management determines that it is in the best interest of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin to work further with the borrower to arrange a workout plan. The foreclosure process would begin when a loan becomes 120 days delinquent. From time to time we may accept deeds in lieu of foreclosure.
 
Loans Past Due and Nonperforming Assets. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis. Management determines that a loan is impaired or nonperforming when it is probable at least a portion of the loan will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  When a loan is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan in the allowance for loan losses is based on present value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. Non-accrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on non-accrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received on a cash basis or cost recovery method.  

 17


When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed assets.  Foreclosed assets are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Soon after acquisition, we order a new appraisal to determine the current market value of the property. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan satisfied over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for loan losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense, in either case during the applicable period of such determination. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed.  Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.

Nonperforming Loans. We generally cease accruing interest on our loans when contractual payments of principal or interest have become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans generally is applied against principal or interest and is recognized on a cash basis. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.
 
Nonperforming loans decreased to $720,000, or 0.36% of total loans, at December 31, 2018 from $1.2 million, or 0.72% of total loans, at December 31, 2017 and $2.9 million, or 1.72% of total loans, at December 31, 2016.
 
Troubled Debt Restructurings. Loans are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties that lead to a restructuring of the loan, and First Federal Bank of Wisconsin grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. These concessions include a modification of terms, such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or loan balance, a reduction of accrued interest, an extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, or some combination thereof to facilitate payment. Troubled debt restructurings are considered impaired loans. There were no additional funds committed to impaired loans as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $50,000 was committed to one impaired loan relationship to finance costs relating to the disposal of several properties.
 
 19


Loans on non-accrual status at the date of modification are initially classified as non-accrual troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2018, we had $700,000 in non-accrual troubled debt restructurings. Our policy provides that troubled debt restructured loans are returned to accrual status after a period of satisfactory and reasonable future payment performance under the terms of the restructuring. Satisfactory payment performance is generally no less than six consecutive months of timely payments. At December 31, 2018, we had $501,000 in accruing troubled debt restructurings.
 
Nonperforming Assets. The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $31,000. Interest income recognized on such loans for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $31,000.

Foreclosed Assets.  Foreclosed assets consist of property acquired through formal foreclosure, in-substance foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, and are recorded at the lower of recorded investment or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Write-downs from recorded investment to fair value, which are required at the time of foreclosure, are charged to the allowance for loan losses. After transfer, adjustments to the carrying value of the properties that result from subsequent declines in value are charged to operations in the period in which the declines occur. During the year ended December 31, 2018, six loans totaling $221,000 secured by one- to four-family investor-owned residential properties and one loan totaling $69,000 secured by 1-4 family owner-occupied residential property were transferred into foreclosed assets. We had $69,000 and $619,000 of foreclosed assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Other Loans of Concern. There were no other loans at December 31, 2018 that are not already disclosed where there is information about possible credit problems of borrowers that caused management to have serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and that may result in disclosure of such loans in the future.
Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the OCC to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management.
 
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses in the loan portfolio. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
 
In accordance with our loan policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the “watch list” initially because of emerging financial weaknesses even though the loan is currently performing as agreed, or if the loan possesses weaknesses although currently performing. If a loan deteriorates in asset quality, the classification is changed to “special mention,” “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status and classified “substandard.” Management reviews the status of each impaired loan on our watch list on a quarterly basis.
 
 21


Allowance for Loan Losses 
 
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in management’s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, and economic conditions. Allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. Because of uncertainties associated with regional economic conditions, collateral values, and future cash flows on impaired loans, it is reasonably possible that management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change materially in the near-term. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is charged to expense and reduced by full and partial charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses. Management’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses.
 
As an integral part of their examination process, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will periodically review our allowance for loan losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in the process for establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses. The following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.

There were $195,000 and $97,000 in net loan charge-offs during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and management may determine that increases in the allowance are necessary if the quality of any portion of our loan portfolio deteriorates as a result. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Investment Activities 
 
General. The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs, to help mitigate interest rate and market risk, to diversify our assets, and to generate a reasonable rate of return on funds within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. Our board of directors is responsible for adopting our investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed annually by the board of directors. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to our president and chief executive officer and our chief financial officer. All investment transactions are reviewed at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors. Since 2014, we have classified all of our investment securities as available-for-sale.
 
We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises and municipal governments, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and investment grade marketable equity securities. We also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago stock. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, we had no investments in derivative securities at December 31, 2018.
 
The following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our investment securities portfolio (excluding Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago common stock) at the dates indicated. At the dates indicated, all of our investment securities were held as available-for-sale.

U.S. Government and Agency Obligations. At December 31, 2018, we had U.S. government and agency securities totaling $1.3 million, which constituted 3.0% of our securities portfolio. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent we deem appropriate, for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings and for prepayment protection.
 
Corporate Debt Securities. At December 31, 2018, we had corporate debt securities totaling $4.2 million, which constituted 9.5% of our securities portfolio. All of our corporate debt securities are investment grade and have maturities not in excess of 10 years. These securities generally provide slightly higher yields than U.S. government and agency securities and mortgage-backed securities.
State and Political Subdivision (“Municipal”) Securities. At December 31, 2018, we had municipal securities totaling $8.3 million, which constituted 19.0% of our securities portfolio. Our current municipal securities have a weighted average maturity of 9.3 years. These securities often provide slightly higher after-tax yields than U.S. government and agency securities and mortgage-backed securities, but are not as liquid as other investments, so we typically maintain investments in municipal securities, to the extent appropriate, for generating returns in our investment portfolio.
 
Mortgage-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2018, we had mortgage-backed securities totaling $28.5 million, which constituted 65.2% of our securities portfolio, including $12.3 million of agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Of the $28.5 million of mortgage-backed securities, $8.4 million were commercial and $20.1 million were residential mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass-through” certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is “passed through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Residential mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of 1-4 family or multi-family mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by 1-4 family mortgages. Commercial mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of commercial mortgage loans. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as First Federal Bank of Wisconsin. The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. All of our mortgage-backed securities are either backed by Ginnie Mae, a U.S. government agency, the Small Business Administration or government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 
Residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments.
 
 25


Other Securities. We held common stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago in connection with our borrowing activities totaling $739,000 at December 31, 2018. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago common stock is carried at cost. We may be required to purchase additional Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago stock if we increase borrowings in the future.
Bank-Owned Life Insurance. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for certain of our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that is non-taxable. At December 31, 2018, our balance in bank-owned life insurance totaled $7.0 million and was issued by two insurance companies, both of which were rated AA+ by Standard & Poors.
Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago advances, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments, maturities and calls of available-for-sale securities, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
 
Deposits.  Our deposits are generated primarily from residents within our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, money market accounts, statement savings, health savings and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. We have not in the past used, and currently do not hold, any brokered deposits. However, depending on our needs, we expect to utilize brokered certificates of deposit and online sources as alternative funding sources. At December 31, 2018, our core deposits, which are deposits other than certificates of deposit, were $95.1 million, representing 51.9% of total deposits. As part of our business strategy, we intend to continue our effort to increase our core deposits through the commercial product line, which will allow the brokered certificates and online sources to run off upon maturity.
 
Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers’ demands. Our ability to gather deposits is impacted by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products. We believe that deposits are a stable source of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including competition and prevailing interest rates.

Borrowed Funds. We may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago upon the security of our capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and certain of our mortgage loans. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile. At December 31, 2018, we had $17.8 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. At December 31, 2018, our available and unused portion of this borrowing agreement was $2 million.
 
Additionally, at December 31, 2018 we had a $7 million federal funds rate line of credit with the Bankers’ Bank of Wisconsin, of which $0 was drawn at December 31, 2018. We also has the authority to borrow through the Federal Reserve’s Discount Window.

Expense and Tax Allocation
 
First Federal Bank of Wisconsin has entered into an agreement with FFBW, Inc. to provide it with certain administrative support services for compensation not less than the fair market value of the services provided. In addition, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin and FFBW, Inc. have entered into an agreement to establish a method for allocating and for reimbursing the payment of their consolidated tax liability.
Personnel
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 43 full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees.
TAXATION
 
FFBW Inc. and First Federal Bank of Wisconsin are subject to federal and state income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize material income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to FFBW, MHC, FFBW, Inc. and First Federal Bank of Wisconsin.
 
Our federal and state tax returns have not been audited for the past six years.
 
Federal Taxation 
 
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns. FFBW, Inc. and First Federal Bank of Wisconsin file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for income taxes on bad debt reserves by savings institutions. For taxable years beginning after 1995, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin has been subject to the same bad debt reserve rules as commercial banks. It currently utilizes the specific charge-off method under Section 582(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”).
Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, less an exemption amount, referred to as “alternative minimum taxable income.” The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent tax computed this way exceeds tax computed by applying the regular tax rates to regular taxable income. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. After the computation of taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin had no minimum tax credit carryforward.
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Generally, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2018, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin had no federal net operating loss carryovers.
 
Capital Loss Carryovers. A corporation cannot recognize capital losses in excess of capital gains generated. Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which it is carried and is used to offset any capital gains. Any undeducted loss remaining after the five-year carryover period is not deductible.  At December 31, 2018, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin had no capital loss carryovers.
 
Corporate Dividends. FFBW, Inc. may generally exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from First Federal Bank of Wisconsin as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
 
 28


State Taxation
 
FFBW, Inc. is subject to the Wisconsin corporate franchise (income) tax. Wisconsin imposes a corporate franchise tax of 7.9% on the combined taxable incomes of the members of FFBW’s consolidated income tax group, which will include First Federal Bank of Wisconsin.
 
Our  state tax returns have not been audited for the last six years.
 
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Wisconsin law allows financial institutions to carry forward a Wisconsin net operating loss to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2018, the Company had no Wisconsin net operating loss carryovers.
REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
 General
 
As a federal savings association, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin is subject to examination, supervision and regulation, primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and, secondarily, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as deposits insurer. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which First Federal Bank of Wisconsin may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund.
 
First Federal Bank of Wisconsin is also regulated to a lesser extent by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the “Federal Reserve Board,” which governs the reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. In addition, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a lesser extent, state law, including in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin’s loan documents.
 
As a savings and loan holding company, FFBW, Inc. is subject to examination and supervision by, and be required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve Board. FFBW, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
 
Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to First Federal Bank of Wisconsin and FFBW, Inc. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on First Federal Bank of Wisconsin and FFBW, Inc. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on FFBW, Inc., First Federal Bank of Wisconsin and their operations.
 
 29


Dodd-Frank Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Act which became law in 2011 made significant changes to the regulatory structure for depository institutions and their holding companies. However, the Dodd-Frank Act’s changes go well beyond that and affect the lending, investments and other operations of all depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for both bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital for holding companies were restricted to capital instruments that were then currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. Subsequent regulations issued by the Federal Reserve Board generally exempted from these requirements bank and savings and loan holding companies of less than $1 billion of consolidated assets. The legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions, and directed the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as First Federal Bank of Wisconsin, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets continue to be examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakened the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations, and gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The legislation also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank and savings and loan holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded. Further, the legislation required that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans, directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage originations.
 
Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act involve delayed effective dates and/or require implementing regulations. The implementation of the legislation is an ongoing process and the impact on operations cannot yet fully be assessed. The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increased regulatory burden and increased compliance, operating and interest expense for First Federal Bank of Wisconsin. However, in February 2017, the President issued an executive order that a policy of his administration would be making regulation efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored, and directed certain regulatory agencies to review and identify laws and regulations that inhibit federal regulation of the U.S. financial system in a manner consistent with the policies stated in the executive order. Any changes in laws or regulation as a result of this review could result in a repeal, amendment to or delayed implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 

Federal Banking Regulation 
 
Business Activities. A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized, for the first time, the payment of interest on commercial checking accounts. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin may also establish, subject to specified investment limits, service corporation subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for First Federal Bank of Wisconsin, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage.
 
 30


Examinations and Assessments.   First Federal Bank of Wisconsin is primarily supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin is required to pay assessments to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to fund the agency’s operations.
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including federal savings associations, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 
The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. The regulations also establish a minimum required leverage ratio of at least 4% of Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
 
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, an institution’s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risk deemed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
 
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
 
As a result of the recently enacted Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies are required to develop a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion.  A “qualifying community bank” that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under Prompt Corrective Action statutes.  The federal banking agencies may consider a financial institution’s risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement. The federal banking agencies must set the minimum capital for the new Community Bank Leverage Ratio at not less than 8% and not more than 10%.  The federal regulators jointly issued a proposed rule on November 21, 2018, whereby a qualifying community bank organization may elect, but is not required to, use the community bank leverage ratio capital framework, in which case it will be considered well-capitalized so long as its community bank leverage ratio is greater than 9%.  A financial institution can elect to be subject to this new definition.
 
At December 31, 2018, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements including the applicable capital conservation buffer.
 
 31


Loans-to-One Borrower.  Generally, a federal savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by “readily marketable collateral,” which generally includes certain financial instruments (but not real estate). As of December 31, 2018, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
 
Prompt Corrective Action. Under the federal Prompt Corrective Action statute, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital. An institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5% or a leverage ratio of less than 4% is considered to be “undercapitalized.” A savings institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0% is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.” A savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.”
 
Generally, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a federal savings association that becomes “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency within 45 days of the date that a federal savings association is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company of a federal savings association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5.0% of the savings association’s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the amount necessary to restore the savings association to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency notifies the savings association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters.  Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures such as restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings associations, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
 
At December 31, 2018, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized,” which means that its total risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10%, its Tier 1 risk-based ratio exceeded 8.0%, its common equity Tier 1 ratio exceeded 6.5% and its leverage ratio exceeded 5.0%.
 
 32


Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings association, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” test. Under the QTL test, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of every 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings association, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association’s business.
 
Alternatively, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
 
A savings association that fails the QTL test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners’ Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2018, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin satisfied the QTL test.
 
Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings association’s capital account. A federal savings association must file an application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for approval of a capital distribution if:

● | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings association’s net income for that year to date plus the savings association’s retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as First Federal Bank of Wisconsin, must file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend.
 
An application or notice related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if:
 

● | the federal savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement.
 
 33


Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings association, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to assess the federal savings association’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings association’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
 
The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination. 
 
Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings association’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as First Federal Bank of Wisconsin. FFBW, Inc. will be an affiliate of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin because of its control of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.
 
First Federal Bank of Wisconsin’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:
 

● | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin’s capital.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by First Federal Bank of Wisconsin’s board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.
 
Enforcement. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings association. Formal enforcement action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1.0 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances.
 
 34


Insurance of Deposit Accounts.  The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions such as First Federal Bank of Wisconsin. Deposit accounts in First Federal Bank of Wisconsin are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts.
 
The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s rate depended upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay lower FDIC assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.
 
Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories. Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for most banks and savings associations to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points.
 
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2018, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin was in compliance with this requirement.
Proposed Federal Regulation. On September 10, 2018, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a proposed rule implementing a section of the Economic Growth, Relief and Consumer Protection Act that permits an eligible federal savings association with total consolidated assets of $20 billion or less as of December 31, 2017, to elect to operate with national bank powers without converting to a national bank charter.  An eligible savings association is a federal savings association that: (1) is well capitalized; (2) has a CAMELs composite rating of 1 or 2; (3) has a consumer compliance rating of 1 or 2; (4) has a Community Reinvestment Act rating of “outstanding” or “satisfactory,” if applicable; and (5) is not subject to an enforcement action.  The proposed rule is subject to change, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will issue a final rule after reviewing all comments on the proposal.

Holding Company Regulation
 
General. FFBW, Inc. and FFBW, MHC are non-diversified savings and loan holding companies within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, FFBW, Inc. and FFBW, MHC are registered with the Federal Reserve Board and are subject to the regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over FFBW, Inc., FFBW, MHC and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution.
Permissible Activities. Under present law, the business activities of FFBW, Inc. and FFBW, MHC are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, provided certain conditions are met and financial holding company status is elected, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to regulatory approval, and certain additional activities authorized by federal regulations. FFBW, Inc. and FFBW, MHC have not elected financial holding company status.
 
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including FFBW, Inc. and FFBW, MHC, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company, without prior Federal Reserve Board approval. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
 
The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions:
 

● | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Capital. Savings and loan holding companies have historically not been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to establish for all bank and savings and loan holding companies, minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. However, pursuant to legislation passed in December 2014, the Federal Reserve Board extended to savings and loan holding companies the applicability of the “Small Bank Holding Company” exception to its consolidated capital requirements and increased the threshold for the exception from $500 million of assets to $1.0 billion, effective May 15, 2015. As a result, savings and loan holding companies with less than $1.0 billion in consolidated assets are generally not subject to the capital requirements unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve Board.

Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations requiring that all savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions.
Dividends and Stock Repurchases. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall supervisory financial condition. Separate regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with Federal Reserve Bank staff concerning dividends in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a savings and loan holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary savings association becomes undercapitalized. The regulatory guidance also states that a savings and loan holding company should inform Federal Reserve Bank supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the savings and loan holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, at the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of FFBW, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
 
Waivers of Dividends by FFBW, MHC. FFBW, Inc. may pay dividends on its common stock to public stockholders. If it does, it is also required to pay dividends to FFBW, MHC, unless FFBW, MHC elects to waive the receipt of dividends. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, FFBW, MHC must receive the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may waive the receipt of any dividends from FFBW, Inc. The Federal Reserve Board has issued an interim final rule providing that it will not object to dividend waivers under certain circumstances, including circumstances where the waiver is not detrimental to the safe and sound operation of the savings association and a majority of the mutual holding company’s members have approved the waiver of dividends by the mutual holding company within the previous twelve months. In addition, for a “non-grandfathered” mutual holding company such as FFBW, MHC, each officer or director of FFBW, Inc. and First Federal Bank of Wisconsin, and any tax-qualified stock benefit plan or non-tax-qualified stock benefit plan in which such individual participates that holds any shares of stock to which the waiver would apply, must waive the right to receive any such dividend declared. In addition, any dividends waived by FFBW, MHC must be considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio in the event of a conversion of the mutual holding company to stock form.
 
Acquisition. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition.

Federal Securities Laws
 
FFBW, Inc.’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. FFBW, Inc. will be subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
The JOBS Act, which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” FFBW, Inc. qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.
 
An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold non-binding advisory stockholder votes on annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or on executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation; however, FFBW, Inc. will also not be subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally less than $75 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. FFBW, Inc. has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company.
 
A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.07 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates).
