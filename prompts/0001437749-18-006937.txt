ITEM 1. Business
Corporate Overview
 
Nuo Therapeutics, Inc. is a Delaware corporation organized in 1998 under the name Informatix Holdings, Inc. As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “Nuo Therapeutics,” “Nuo” and the “Company” refer to Nuo Therapeutics, Inc., and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, unless the context indicates otherwise. In 1999, Autologous Wound Therapy, Inc., or AWT, an Arkansas Corporation, merged with and into Informatix Holdings, Inc. and the name of the surviving corporation was changed to Autologous Wound Therapy, Inc. In 2000, AWT changed its name to Cytomedix, Inc., or Cytomedix. In 2001, Cytomedix, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, after which Cytomedix was authorized to continue to conduct its business as a debtor and debtor-in-possession. Cytomedix emerged from bankruptcy in 2002 under a Plan of Reorganization. At that time, all of Cytomedix’s securities or other claims against or equity interest in Cytomedix, were canceled and of no further force or effect. Holders of certain securities, other claims or equity interests were entitled to receive new securities from Cytomedix in exchange for their securities, other claims or equity interests prior to the bankruptcy. In September 2007, Cytomedix received 510(k) clearance for the Aurix System, or Aurix (formerly known as the AutoloGelTM System), from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In April 2010, Cytomedix acquired the Angel® Whole Blood Separation System, referred to as Angel or the Angel® Business, from Sorin Group USA, Inc., or Sorin. In February 2012, Cytomedix, acquired Aldagen, Inc., or Aldagen, a privately held developmental cell-therapy company located in Durham, NC. In 2014, Cytomedix changed its name to Nuo Therapeutics, Inc. In 2016, Nuo Therapeutics filed for and emerged from bankruptcy under Chapter 11 as described below under “- Bankruptcy and Emergence from Bankruptcy.” Aldagen is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nuo Therapeutics. Our principal offices are located at 207A Perry Parkway, Suite 1, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20877; and our telephone number is (240) 499-2680.
 
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Regions
 
Through December 31, 2017, Nuo Therapeutics had only one operating segment. Nuo Therapeutics primarily operates in the United States (“U.S.”). Revenues from sales generated outside the U.S. are separately presented in this report under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
 
Our Business 
 
We are a regenerative therapies company developing and marketing products for chronic wound care primarily within the U.S. We commercialize innovative cell-based technologies that harness the regenerative capacity of the human body to trigger natural healing. The use of autologous (from self) biological therapies for tissue repair and regeneration is part of a transformative clinical strategy designed to improve long-term recovery in inherently complex chronic conditions with significant unmet medical needs.
 
Our current commercial offering consists of a point of care technology for the safe and efficient separation of autologous (i.e., the patient’s own) blood to produce a platelet based therapy for the chronic wound care market (“Aurix” or the “Aurix System”). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, cleared the Aurix System for marketing in 2007 as a device under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Aurix is the only platelet derived product cleared by the FDA for chronic wound care use and is indicated for most exuding wounds. The advanced wound care market, within which Aurix competes, is composed of advanced wound care dressings, wound care devices, and wound care biologics, and is estimated to be an approximate $13.4 billion global market, with the number of patients suffering from all forms of chronic wounds projected to increase worldwide at a rate of approximately eight percent per year through 2025.  
 
The Aurix System produces a platelet rich plasma, or PRP, gel at the point of care using the patient’s own platelets and plasma. Aurix comprises a natural, endogenous complement of protein and non-protein signal molecules that contribute to effective healing. During treatment, the patient’s platelets are activated and release hundreds of growth factor proteins and other signaling molecules that form a biologically active hematogel. Aurix delivers concentrations of the natural complement of cytokines, growth factors and chemokines that are known to regulate angiogenesis (i.e., the development of new blood vessels), cell growth and the formation of new tissue. Once applied to the prepared wound bed, the biologically active Aurix hematogel can restore the balance in the wound environment to transform a non-healing wound to a wound that heals naturally.
 
A 2012 Medicare National Coverage Determination, or NCD, from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, reversed a twenty year old non-coverage decision for autologous blood derived products used in wound care; this NCD allows for Medicare coverage under the Coverage with Evidence Development, or CED, program.
 
 1


The most significant near term growth opportunity for Aurix are the clinical studies being conducted under this CED program. Under the CED program, CMS provides reimbursement for items or services on the condition that they be furnished in approved clinical protocols or in the collection of additional clinical data. Current sales outside of the Federal Supply Schedule and Medicare reimbursement are practically limited to patients participating in certain Company-sponsored clinical studies approved by CMS under the CED program. The Company’s ongoing collaboration with Restorix Health, Inc., or Restorix, is intended to expand patient enrollment in three distinct Company-sponsored open-label clinical study protocols. Under these three protocols, Aurix can be used for venous, pressure and diabetic foot ulcers for wound types of all severities and for patients with various and often difficult comorbidities. Under the CED program, a facility treating a patient with Aurix is reimbursed by Medicare when health outcomes data are collected to inform future coverage decisions. The intent of the CED program is to evaluate the outcomes of Aurix therapy for the broader Medicare population when it is used in a “real world” continuum of care.  Thus far, the Company and Restorix have been unsuccessful in meaningfully expanding patient enrollment in the three clinical study protocols. 
 
If and only if the CED program is successfully completed, if supported by the health outcomes data generated, CMS may expand Medicare reimbursement for treatment of chronic non-healing wounds with Aurix as an autologous platelet-rich plasma product. By contrast, if the data generated show no substantial improvement in health outcomes for patients using Aurix therapy, CMS may determine not to provide unrestricted coverage for the Aurix System. CED programs have been employed for a variety of other therapies, including transcatheter aortic valve repair and cochlear implantation.  
 
Although FDA cleared the Aurix System for marketing in 2007 under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, CMS only established economically viable reimbursement for the product beginning in 2016. For 2018, the CMS national average reimbursement rate for the Aurix System is $1,568 per treatment, which we believe provides appropriate payment to facilities for product usage and a compelling market opportunity for us. The Company markets the Aurix System at a cost of $700 per treatment to wound care facilities operating in the CED program.
 
Growth opportunities for the Aurix System in the United States in the near to intermediate term include the treatment of chronic wounds with Aurix in (i) the Medicare population under the NCD, when health outcomes data is collected under the CED program of CMS and (ii) the Veterans Affairs, or VA, healthcare system and other federal accounts settings.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our near-term strategic focus is on the successful execution and completion of the three clinical protocols for Aurix under the CMS CED program. The expansion of reimbursement to patients outside these protocols can be achieved only after successful conclusion of the data collection and submission of the resulting data to CMS. There are no assurances that broad access and reimbursement can be achieved. Because Medicare beneficiaries represent the majority of chronic wound patients in the United States and since commercial insurance coverage determinations often follow CMS coverage and reimbursement decisions, we believe that successful conclusion of the CED program would substantially increase the commercial value of Aurix. Thus, we believe that the market for innovative technologies that harness the innate regenerative capacity of the human body to trigger natural healing represents a significant opportunity from both a clinical and a business perspective.
 
Assuming that we are able to obtain immediate and substantial additional financing, our goal is to successfully commercialize the Aurix System in the U.S. for the treatment of chronic wounds. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include steps to secure broad CMS reimbursement under the CED program:
 

● | We secured a CMS coverage and reimbursement decision for Aurix therapy under the CED program in 2012 via the NCD and economically viable reimbursement rates beginning in 2016. The CED protocols require the collection of wound healing data including Quality of Life metrics for a population of approximately 2,200 Medicare beneficiaries across three separate and distinct wound etiologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | With the goal of executing the CED program efficiently and in a timely manner, we initiated a collaboration with Restorix in May 2016 to expand the number of study centers and to increase the rate of patient enrollment beyond what we have established independently. Restorix is a leading wound care management company overseeing day-to-day operations in approximately 200 outpatient wound care centers. The three protocols for the CED program are prospective, open-label, randomized (1:1) studies treating Medicare beneficiaries only. The studies will compare usual and customary care, or UCC, with Aurix plus UCC. The primary outcome measurement is time to heal. The three protocols comprise:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Diabetic Foot Ulcers: The study endpoint is the earlier of complete healing or 12 weeks following enrollment and the estimated enrollment is 760 randomized patients. The first patient was enrolled in May 2015, and 122 patients have enrolled to date.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Venous Leg Ulcers: The study endpoint is the earlier of complete healing or 12 weeks following enrollment and the estimated enrollment is 640 patients. The first patient was enrolled in March 2015, and 96 patients have enrolled to date.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Pressure Ulcers: The study endpoint is the earlier of complete healing or 16 weeks following enrollment and the estimated enrollment is 800 patients. The first patient was enrolled in April 2015, and 46 patients have enrolled to date.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | To increase the opportunity for greater enrollment in our CED program, we have been in discussion with CMS’ Division of Practitioner Services regarding the fee paid (if any) by Medicare to the treating physician for services rendered during an Aurix treatment application under CED. Unlike the facility fee reimbursed by Medicare as mandated by the CED National Coverage Determination, or NCD, for the Aurix product itself, any physician fee was to be established by the regional Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, at their discretion. Given the Company's assessment of the MAC’s apparent lack of familiarity with CED generally as a CMS national initiative and Aurix as a product with limited usage and history in Medicare’s databases, establishment of a consistent physician fee reflective of the underlying work performed by a treating physician when utilizing Aurix therapy has been difficult. Our discussions with CMS have emphasized the potential benefit to the Aurix CED program in establishing a standard national payment rate applied consistently to all physicians treating patients in the CED protocols that provides an adequate payment to the physician for utilizing Aurix. See additional discussion at Risk Factors “The Lack of an Economically Appropriate Physician Fee for Aurix Treatments May Continue to Present an Obstacle to Adequate Levels of Patient Enrollment in the CED Protocols”. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To support our CED efforts, we have hired and deployed a small team of clinical affairs professionals. The clinical affairs group is focused on both support of health care providers and facilities - through the Restorix collaboration and those we have initiated outside the Restorix relationship - in their use of Aurix as well as facilitating the collection of the clinical data required to fulfill the Aurix Medicare CED requirements
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Based on guidance from the CMS Coverage and Analysis Group (CAG), a CED cycle is considered complete when CMS completes a reconsideration of the existing National Coverage Determination and removes the requirement for study participation as a condition of coverage. The request for reconsideration would typically follow the same nine-month timetable as other NCD requests.  Each protocol operates independently and the diabetic foot protocol is expected to reach complete enrollment first, although we can provide no assurances to this effect. We can provide no assurances that the pace of enrollment will increase as expected or that any of the three protocols will reach their required enrollment levels. Each protocol also includes the option for Nuo to perform an interim analysis based on 50% enrollment with a view towards earlier submission of study data for publication and subsequent submission to CAG for consideration.
 
Assuming that we are able to obtain immediate and substantial additional financing, while we are focused primarily on the commercialization of our FDA-cleared Aurix System in the U.S., a secondary priority for us is to develop and commercialize our products in markets outside the U.S. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2014, we signed an exclusive licensing and distribution agreement for the Aurix System with Rohto Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Rohto, providing them with an exclusive license and the right to develop and commercialize Aurix in Japan. The agreement stipulates royalty payments based on the net sales of Aurix in Japan and an additional future cash payment in the event a specific reimbursement milestone is met.  Rohto has assumed all responsibility for securing the marketing authorization from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare while we will provide relevant product information, as well as clinical and other data to support Rohto’s regulatory activities.
 
Additionally, on May 5, 2016, we entered into an exclusive licensing and distribution agreement for the Aurix System with Boyalife Hong Kong Ltd., or Boyalife. Under this agreement, Boyalife received a non-transferable, exclusive license, with limited right to sublicense, to use certain of the intellectual property relating to our Aurix System. Boyalife is entitled to import, use for development, promote, market, sell and distribute Aurix in greater China (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau) for all regenerative medicine applications, including but not limited to wound care and topical dermatology applications in human and veterinary medicine.
 
We require significant additional capital to fully support an expanded commercialization initiative designed to increase market adoption and penetration of Aurix after completion of the CED protocols. See “– Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 
The Science Underlying Aurix/Platelet Rich Plasma
 
Normal Wound Healing
 
The science underlying wound healing is well-established. An immediate early event critical for wound healing is the influx of platelets to the wound site. Platelets bind to elements within damaged tissue such as collagen fragments and endogenous thrombin molecules and are activated to release a diversity of growth factors and other biomolecules from their alpha and dense granules (Reed 2000, Nieswandt, 2003). These biomolecules provide signals essential for biological responses regulating hemostasis and effective tissue regeneration.
 
 3


Chronic Wounds
 
Dysregulation of numerous cellular and biological responses contribute to the chronic wound phenotype. Chronic wounds have reduced levels of growth factors and concomitant decreases in cellular proliferation (Mast 1996). There is increased cellular senescence (Telgenhoff 2005), and there generally is a lack of perfusion that can inhibit the delivery of nutrients and cells required for regeneration (Guo 2010). As the body attempts to stave off infection, elevated concentrations of free radicals accumulate in the chronic wound and further damage surrounding tissue (Moseley 2004, James 2003).
Aurix Therapy
 
Aurix has been cleared by FDA as safe and effective with an indication for chronic wounds such as leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, and diabetic ulcers and other exuding wounds such as mechanically or surgically-debrided wounds. The Aurix therapeutic is formed by mixing a sample of a patient’s platelets and plasma with pharmaceutical grade thrombin and ascorbic acid. The thrombin activates platelets while ascorbic acid drives the synthesis of high tensile strength collagen, clears damaging free radicals and controls gel consistency. The topical dermal application of Aurix gel bypasses the lack of local perfusion to provide immediate signals for new tissue formation and ultimately healing.
The Efficacy of Aurix Relates to Biological Activity Released by Platelets
 
Regenerative Capacity
 
More than 300 proteins are released by human platelets in response to thrombin activation (Coppinger, 2004). Important examples include vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B) (Eppley 2004, Everts 2006). These proteins are critical for organized wound healing, regulating responses such as vascularization, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and deposition of new extracellular matrix (Goldman 2004). Platelets also release chemokines such as Interleukin-8 (IL-8), stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and platelet factor-4 (PF-4) (Chatterjee 2011, Gear 2003) that control the mobilization and migration of stem cells and fibroblasts, (Werner 2003 and Gillitzer 2001) that contribute to tissue regeneration.
Anti-infective Activity
 
Populations of bioburden in chronic wounds vary over time and wounds invariably retain or become re-infected with some level of bacteria that is detrimental to healing (Howell-Jones 2005). In addition to regenerative capacity, platelets release anti-microbial peptides effective against a broad range of pathogens including Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) (Moojen 2007, Jia 2010, Tang 2002, Bielecki 2007).
Clinical Efficacy
 
Multiple efficacy and effectiveness studies have been published in peer reviewed journals documenting the impact of using Aurix to treat chronic wounds. Key data include:
 

● | In a double blinded randomized controlled trial, 81% of the most common-sized diabetic foot ulcers healed with Aurix compared with 42% of control wounds. Mean time to healing was 6 weeks. (Driver V, Hanft J, Fylling, C et al.: A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial of Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma Gel for the Treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers. Ostomy Wound Management, 2006; 52(6): 68-87.) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In 285 chronic wounds in 200 patients, 96.5% of the wounds had a positive response within an average of 2.2 weeks with an average of 2.8 Aurix treatments (de Leon J, Driver VR, Fylling CP, Carter MJ, Anderson C, Wilson J, et al.: The Clinical Relevance of Treating Chronic Wounds With an Enhanced Near-physiological Concentration of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Gel. Advances in Skin and Wound Care, 2011; 24(8), 357-368.) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In a retrospective, longitudinal study of 40 Wagner grade II through IV diabetic foot ulcers, most with critical limb ischemia, wounds increased in size in the approximate 100 days prior to the initiation of comprehensive wound care treatment. Upon treatment with debridement, revascularization, antibiotics and off-loading, the wounds continued to increase in size over a subsequent 75 day period. Once they were then treated with Aurix, the wounds immediately changed healing trajectory and 83% of the wounds healed with an average of 6.1 Aurix treatments per wound (Sakata, J., Sasaki, S., Handa, K., et al. A Retrospective, Longitudinal Study to Evaluate Healing Lower Extremity Wounds in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus and Ischemia Using Standard Protocols of Care and Platelet-Rich Plasma Gel in a Japanese Wound Care Program. Ostomy Wound Management, 2012; 58(4):36-49.)

Aurix Licensing and Collaboration Arrangements
 
In September 2009, we entered into an original license and distribution agreement with Millennia Holdings, Inc., or Millennia (collectively with its affiliates), for the Company’s Aurix System in Japan.
 
As of December 31, 2014, we granted to Rohto Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Rohto, a royalty bearing, nontransferable, exclusive license, with limited right to sublicense, to use certain of the Company’s intellectual property for the development, import, use, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution for all wound care and topical dermatology applications of the Aurix System and related intellectual property and know-how in human and veterinary medicine in Japan in exchange for an upfront payment from Rohto of $3.0 million. The agreement also contemplates additional royalty payments based on the net sales of Aurix in Japan and an additional cash payment of $1.0 million if and when the reimbursement price for the national health insurance system in Japan has been achieved after marketing authorization as described below.
 
In conjunction with the Rohto license, we amended, as of December 31, 2014, our licensing and distribution agreement with Millennia to terminate the agreement and to allow us to transfer the Japanese exclusivity rights from Millennia to Rohto. In connection with this amendment, we paid a one-time, non-refundable fee of $1.5 million to Millennia upon our receipt of the $3.0 million upfront payment from Rohto and are required to make a one-time, non-refundable payment of $0.5 million upon our receipt of the $1.0 million reimbursement milestone payment from Rohto, and may be required to make future royalty payments up to a maximum of $5 million to Millennia based upon net sales in Japan.  Millennia has been instrumental in establishing the advanced wound care market in Japan, and will continue to work with Rohto to develop the market for Aurix in that market. Further, Rohto has assumed responsibility for securing the marketing authorization from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, while we will provide relevant product information, as well as clinical and other data to support Rohto’s regulatory initiatives.
 
On March 22, 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Restorix, pursuant to which we agreed to provide Restorix with certain limited geographic exclusivity benefits over a defined period of time for the usage of the Aurix System in up to 30 of the approximately 125 hospital outpatient wound care clinics with which Restorix has a management contract, or the RXH Partner Hospitals, in exchange for Restorix making minimum commitments of patients enrolled in three prospective clinical research studies primarily consisting of patient data collection, or the Protocols, necessary to maintain exclusivity under the Collaboration Agreement. The Collaboration Agreement will initially continue for a two-year period, subject to one or more extensions with the mutual consent of the parties.
 
Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, the Company agreed to provide: (i) clinical support services by its clinical staff as reasonably agreed between the Company and Restorix as necessary and appropriate, (ii) reasonable and necessary support regarding certain reimbursement activities, (iii) coverage of Institutional Review Board, or IRB, fees and payment to Restorix for certain training costs subject to certain limitations, (iv) an administrative fee for each fully completed and transmitted patient data set, and (v) community-focused public relations materials for participating RXH Partner Hospitals to promote the use of Aurix and participation in the Protocols. Under the Collaboration Agreement, each RXH Partner Hospital will pay the Company the then-current product price ($700 in 2016, and no greater than $750 for the remainder of the initial term) as set forth in the Collaboration Agreement.  In the agreement, Restorix agreed to: (i) provide access and support as reasonably necessary and appropriate at up to 30 RXH Partner Hospitals to identify and enroll patients into the Protocols, including senior executive level support and leadership to the collaboration and its enrollment goals and (ii) reasonably assist the Company to correct through a query process, any patient data submitted having incomplete or inaccurate data fields.
 
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, during the term of the Collaboration Agreement: (i) Restorix will have site specific geographic exclusivity for usage of Aurix in connection with treatment of patients in the Protocols within a 30 mile radius of each RXH Partner Hospital, and (ii) other than with respect to existing CED sites, the Company will not provide corporate exclusivity with any other wound management company operating in excess of 19 wound care facilities for any similar arrangement.
 
The Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by either party for a material breach, subject to a 60 day cure period. The Agreement is further subject to certain covenants regarding confidentiality, assignment, indemnification and limitations on liability, as well as certain representations and warranties of the parties.

Effective as of May 5, 2016, the Company and Boyalife Hong Kong Ltd., or Boyalife, an entity affiliated with the Company’s significant stockholder, Boyalife Investment Fund I, Inc., entered into an Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement with an initial term of five years, unless the agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. We refer to this agreement as the Boyalife Distribution Agreement. Under this agreement, Boyalife received a non-transferable, exclusive license, with limited right to sublicense, to use certain of the Company’s intellectual property relating to its Aurix System for the purposes and in the territory specified below. Under the agreement, Boyalife is entitled to import, use for development, promote, market, sell and distribute the Aurix Products in greater China (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau) for all regenerative medicine applications, including but not limited to wound care and topical dermatology applications in human and veterinary medicine. For purposes of this agreement, “Aurix Products” are defined as the combination of devices to produce a wound dressing from the patient’s blood - as of May 5, 2016 consisting of centrifuge, wound dressing kit and reagent kit. Under the Boyalife Distribution Agreement, Boyalife is obligated to pay the Company (a) $500,000 within 90 days of approval of the Aurix Products by the China Food and Drug Administration, but no earlier than December 31, 2018, and (b) a distribution fee per wound dressing kit and reagent kit of $40, payable quarterly, subject to an agreement by the parties to discuss in good faith the appropriate distribution fee if the pricing of such kits exceeds the current general pricing in greater China. Under the agreement, Boyalife is entitled, with the Company’s approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to procure devices from a third party in order to assemble them with devices supplied by the Company to make the Aurix Products. Boyalife also has a right of first refusal with respect to the Aurix Products in specified countries in the Asia Pacific region excluding Japan and India, exercisable in exchange for a payment of no greater than $250,000 in the aggregate. If Boyalife files a new patent application for a new invention relating to wound dressings, the Aurix Products or the Company’s technology, Boyalife will grant the Company a free, non-exclusive license to use such patent application outside greater China during the term of the Boyalife Distribution Agreement.
 
Angel Product Line
 
The Company formerly owned the Angel cPRP System. This system, acquired from Sorin Group USA, Inc. in April 2010, is designed for single-patient use at the point of care, and provides a simple and flexible means for producing quality concentrated PRP and platelet poor plasma, or PPP, from a small sample of whole blood or bone marrow. The Angel cPRP System is a multi-functional cell separation device which produces cPRP for use in the operating room and clinic and is generally used in a range of orthopedic indications.
 
In August 2013, we entered into a Distributor and License Agreement with Arthrex. Under the terms of this agreement, Arthrex obtained the exclusive rights to sell, distribute, and service the Angel cPRP System and activAT throughout the world for all uses other than chronic wound care. We granted Arthrex a limited license to use our intellectual property as part of enabling Arthrex to sell these products. Pursuant to this license, Arthrex purchased these products from us at cost to distribute and service in exchange for payments based on a certain royalty rate depending on volume of the products sold. As described below, we have assigned the right to this royalty stream to Deerfield SS, LLC, the Assignee, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization.
 
On October 16, 2015, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement, or the Amended Arthrex Agreement, with Arthrex, which amended and restated the original agreement. Under the terms of the Amended Arthrex Agreement, the Company granted Arthrex an exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, sub-licensable, transferable license to the Angel patents to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, have sold, distribute and have distributed, import and have imported, the Angel® Concentrated Platelet System, or Angel, product line and certain new enhanced products within a defined field of use and a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, sub-licensable, transferable license to the Angel patents to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, have sold, distribute and have distributed, import and have imported, Angel and certain new enhanced products within certain specified markets. The Company also transferred to Arthrex all of its rights and title to product registration and intellectual property (other than patents) related to Angel. In connection with the Amended Arthrex Agreement, Deerfield (as defined below) irrevocably released their liens on the product registration rights and intellectual property assets (other than patents) transferred by the Company to Arthrex. The Amended Arthrex Agreement provided that, on a date to be determined by Arthrex, but not later than March 31, 2016, Arthrex would assume all rights related to the manufacture and supply of the Angel product line. The Amended Arthrex Agreement, as supplemented in April 2016, is referred to collectively as the Arthrex Agreement.
 
Under the Arthrex Agreement, the Company had the right to receive certain royalties through 2024. However, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, on May 5, 2016, the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with the Assignee, as the designee of Deerfield, to assign to the Assignee the Company’s rights, title and interest in and to the Arthrex Agreement, and to transfer and assign to the Assignee associated intellectual property and royalty and payment rights owned by the Company and licensed thereunder. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, on May 5, 2016, the Company and the Assignee also entered into a Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to continue to service the Arthrex Agreement for a transition period. The Transition Services Agreement generally contemplated that, during this transition period, we will continue to provide for the manufacture and supply to Arthrex of the Angel product line in accordance with the terms of the Arthrex Agreement, and to provide our full cooperation, as commercially reasonable, to assist Arthrex with the manufacture and supply of the Angel product line, notwithstanding the original March 31, 2016 assumption deadline for Arthrex described above. Initially, our obligation to provide such transition services was not to extend beyond October 15, 2016 unless agreed between the Company and the Assignee.
 
On October 20, 2016, the Company entered into the Three Party Letter Agreement with Arthrex and the Assignee, which extended the transition period under the Transition Services Agreement through January 15, 2017. Under the terms of the Three Party Letter Agreement, subject to Arthrex making a payment of $201,200 to the Company on October 28, 2016, (a) the Company has sold, conveyed, transferred and assigned to Arthrex its title and interest in the Company’s inventory of Angel products (including spare parts therefor) and production equipment, and (b) the Assignee is obligated to make three equal payments of $33,333.33 each to the Company as consideration for the extension of the transition period. Under the terms of the Three Party Letter Agreement, the Company has no further obligations under the Transition Services Agreement or the Amended Arthrex Agreement after January 15, 2017. The agreement contains a full and irrevocable release of Arthrex by the Company with respect to any actions, claims or other liabilities for payments of Royalty (as defined in the Amended Arthrex Agreement) owed to the Company based on sales of Angel products occurring on or before June 30, 2016, and a full and irrevocable release of the Company and the Assignee by Arthrex with respect to any actions, claims or other liabilities arising under the Amended Arthrex Agreement as of the date of the Three Party Letter Agreement. Neither Arthrex nor the Assignee assumed any liabilities or obligations of the Company in connection with the Three Party Letter Agreement.

Bankruptcy and Emergence from Bankruptcy
 
On January 26, 2016, the Company filed a voluntary petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, or the Bankruptcy Court, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code, or the Bankruptcy Code, which is administered under the caption "In re: Nuo Therapeutics, Inc.", Case No. 16-10192 (MFW). We refer to this petition and the related case as the Chapter 11 Case. During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Case, the Company continued to operate its business as a "debtor-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.
 
The Company emerged from bankruptcy protection effective May 5, 2016 in accordance with the Modified First Amended Plan of Reorganization of the Debtor under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, as confirmed by the April 25, 2016 Order Granting Final Approval of Disclosure Statement and Confirming Debtor's Plan of Reorganization. We refer to May 5, 2016 as the Effective Date, to the order as the Confirmation Order and to the plan of reorganization, as confirmed by the Confirmation Order, as the Plan of Reorganization.
 
Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, as of the Effective Date all equity interests of the Company, including shares of the Company's common stock (including its redeemable common stock), warrants and options, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date were cancelled, and the Company issued new common stock, warrants and Series A preferred stock. We refer to the Company's common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date as the Old Common Stock. Unless the context otherwise indicates, references in this report to common stock or New Common Stock are to the new common stock, par value $0.0001 per share issued by the Company on and after the Effective Date.
 
On the Effective Date, the Company filed a Certificate of Designations of Series A Preferred Stock, or Certificate of Designations, with the Delaware Secretary of State, designating 29,038 shares of the Company's undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, as Series A preferred stock, or Series A Preferred Stock. On the Effective Date, the Company issued 29,038 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to creditors affiliated with Deerfield Management Company, L.P., in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization. We refer to Deerfield Management Company, L.P. and its affiliates Deerfield Private Design Fund II, L.P., Deerfield Private Design International II, L.P., and Deerfield Special Situations Fund, L.P. collectively as Deerfield. The Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date, is not convertible or redeemable and carries a liquidation preference of $29,038,000, which is required to be paid to holders of such Series A Preferred Stock before any payments are made with respect to shares of New Common Stock (and other capital stock that is not issued on parity or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock) upon a liquidation or change in control transaction. For so long as Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate and elect one member of our Board of Directors. Lawrence S. Atinsky serves as the designee of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, which are all currently affiliates of Deerfield Management Company, L.P., of which Mr. Atinsky is a Partner. The Series A Preferred Stock have voting rights, voting with the New Common Stock as a single class, with each share of Series A Preferred Stock having the right to five votes, currently representing less than 1% of the voting rights of the capital stock of the Company, and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to approve certain transactions. Among other restrictions, the Certificate of Designations for our Series A Preferred Stock limits the Company's ability to (i) issue securities that are senior or pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) incur debt (other than for working capital purposes not in excess of $3.0 million), (iii) issue securities that are junior to the Series A Preferred Stock and that provide certain consent rights to the holders of such junior securities in connection with a liquidation or contain certain liquidation preferences, (iv) pay dividends on or purchase shares of its capital stock, and (v) change the authorized number of members of its Board of Directors to a number other than five, in each case without the consent of holders representing at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares Series A Preferred Stock.
 
In accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, as of the Effective Date, the Company issued 7,500,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 6,180,000 shares of common stock to certain accredited investors in a private placement exempt from registration. The warrants terminate on May 5, 2021 and are exercisable at any time at exercise prices ranging from $0.50 per share to $0.75 per share.
 
A significant majority of the accredited investors who purchased shares of common stock on the Effective Date furthermore executed backstop commitments to purchase up to 12,800,000 additional shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $3,000,000. We refer to these commitments as the Backstop Commitments or the Backstop Commitment.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company exercised its rights under the Backstop Commitment in full and issued an aggregate of 12,800,000 shares of its common stock (the “Backstop Shares”) for gross proceeds of $3.0 million.

As of the Effective Date, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, or the Registration Rights Agreement, with the investors. The Registration Rights Agreement provides certain resale registration rights to the investors with respect to the shares of New Common Stock issued in the Recapitalization Financing. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company filed a registration statement (File No. 333-214748) registering the resale of the New Common Stock issued in the Recapitalization Financing. The Company has agreed under the Registration Rights Agreement to use its best efforts to keep the registration statement continuously effective under the Securities Act until the earliest of (i) the date when all registrable securities under the registration statement may be sold without registration or restriction pursuant to Rule 144(b) under the Securities Act or any successor provision or (ii) the date when all registrable securities under the registration statement have been sold, subject to the Company's ability to suspend sales under the registration statement in certain circumstances. As the Company does not qualify for forward incorporation by reference, the Company has caused the suspension of sales under the registration statement pending the filing and effectiveness of a post-effective amendment containing updated financial information.
 
Customer Concentration
 
In 2017, our revenues consisted of product sales of approximately $0.5 million and royalties of approximately $0.2 million. In 2017, revenue from STEMCELL Technologies accounted for approximately 26% of our total revenue.
 
In 2016, our revenues consisted of product sales of approximately $1.3 million, license fee revenue of approximately $0.1 million and royalties of approximately $0.8 million. In the combined 2016 period, revenue from Arthrex accounted for approximately 61% of our total revenue. For the Successor Company, revenue from STEMCELL Technologies and St. Luke's Hospital System accounted for approximately 22% and 16%, respectively, of total revenue for the period from May 5, 2016 through December 31, 2016. For the Predecessor Company, revenue from Arthrex accounted for approximately 78% of total revenue for the period from January 1, 2016 through May 4, 2016. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue during those periods.
 
Patents, Licenses, and Property Rights 
 
Nuo Therapeutics relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, contractual provisions, and other similar measures, to establish and protect its intellectual property.
 
Historically, the Company has been party to certain royalty agreements relating to its intellectual property under which it pays certain fees, and has acquired additional royalty agreements as part of the acquisition of Aldagen. Currently, the Company is subject to royalty obligations under the following agreements in the following circumstances:
 

● | The inventor is entitled to receive a royalty equal to 5% of gross profits on revenues generated from reliance on the Worden Patents (U.S. patents 6,303,112 and 6,524,568), covering the formulation of Aurix. In conjunction with the release of a security interest in the applicable patents securing our payment obligations under a royalty agreement, we paid the inventor a lump sum $500,000 payment in February 2013 in satisfaction of all remaining minimum monthly royalty payments. In addition, the annual maximum royalty payment was raised to $625,000 from $600,000 in conjunction with the amendment. Finally, the Company has no annual royalty obligation unless and until the calculated annual royalty obligation exceeds $100,000 in a given year. This agreement terminates with the expiration of the patents in 2019. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Under our license agreement with Duke, Duke has granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under its patents and applications that relate to methods for isolating and manufacturing ALDH Bright Cell populations, or the Duke Patents. Under the terms of the Duke license agreement, we are obligated to pay up to a 1% royalty to Duke on all revenues relating to the Duke Patents, subject to an annual minimum of $5,000 per year beginning in the calendar year after the first commercial sale of a licensed product (which will increase to $25,000 upon the achievement of specified development and commercialization milestones). The Company bears all costs to maintain the patents. This agreement terminates with the expiration of the patents in 2018. In light of the lack of any clinical response of statistical significance and limited remaining patent life, the Company sees no further realistic path for development of the Bright Cell technology, and it does not expect to maintain the international patent rights around the related intellectual property. 

 
Nuo Therapeutics’ patent strategy, designed to maximize value, seeks to: (i) assist the Company in establishing significant market positions for its products, (ii) attract strategic partners for collaborative research, development, marketing, distribution, or other agreements, which could include milestone payments to the Company, and (iii) generate revenue streams via out-licensing agreements.

● | Specific chemistries for isolating and manufacturing ALDH Bright Cell populations, related to US Patent Nos. 6,627,759, 6,991,897, and 7,754,480.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The above patent families encompass the Company’s Aurix product, homologous growth factors, wound-healing biomarkers and ALDH Bright Cell populations. These patents have expiration dates ranging from 2018 to 2030. As described in “Angel Product Line” above, the Company has assigned to the Assignee the Company’s rights, title and interest in and to the Arthrex Agreement, and transferred and assigned to the Assignee associated intellectual property and royalty and payment rights owned by the Company and licensed thereunder. In addition, as described in "ALDHbr, or Bright Cell, Technology" above, the Company does not intend to maintain the international patent rights surrounding the Bright Cell technology. As such, international patent rights relating to the Bright Cell technology do not appear above.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, and other countries extensively regulate pharmaceutical products, biologics, and medical devices. The Company’s products and product candidates are subject to approval or clearance by the governing bodies prior to and during the marketing and distribution of a product. Regulatory requirements apply to, but are not limited to, research and development, safety and efficacy, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, advertising and marketing, and the import and export of products. Before a product candidate is approved by the governing bodies for commercial marketing, rigorous preclinical and human clinical testing may be necessary to conduct to determine the safety and efficacy or effectiveness of the product. If the Company fails to comply with the applicable laws and regulations at any time during the product development process, approval or clearance process, or during commercialization, it may become subject to administrative and/or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, refusal to approve or clear pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of the Company’s operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. Any enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Medical Device Regulation
 
The Company currently manufactures and distributes the Aurix System. As such, this and future products manufactured and/or distributed by the Company may be subject to regulations by the applicable governing bodies, including but not limited to, the FDA, Health Canada, the European Medicines Agency, the Japanese Ministry of Health & Welfare, and other regulatory agencies. The Company currently has limited business development initiatives outside of the U.S. Each of the foreign governing bodies noted above serve a similar function as the FDA. As such, the Company and its products and product candidates are subject to the regulations enforced by the outside governing bodies. These regulations include, but are not limited to, product clearance, documentation requirements, good manufacturing practices and medical device reporting. Labeling and promotional activities are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, in certain circumstances. Current enforcement policies prohibit the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. Each governing body reviews the labeling and advertising of medical devices to ensure that unapproved uses are not promoted. Before a new medical device can be introduced to the market, the manufacturer must obtain clearance or approval from the applicable regulatory agency, depending upon the device classification. In the U.S., medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, II, or III. The regulations enforced by the FDA and/or the appropriate governing bodies to the medical device(s) provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective. In the U.S., Class I devices are non-critical products that the FDA believes can be adequately regulated by “general controls” which include provisions relating to labeling, manufacturer registration, defect notification, records and reports, and current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, based on the FDA’s Quality Systems Regulations. Most Class I devices are exempt from pre-market notification and some are also exempt from cGMP requirements. Class II devices are products for which the general controls of Class I devices, by themselves, are not sufficient to assure safety and effectiveness and, therefore, require additional controls. Additional controls for Class II devices may include performance standards, post-market surveillance patient registries, and the use of FDA guidelines. Standards may include both design and performance requirements. Class III devices have the most restrictive controls and require pre-market approval by the FDA. Generally, Class III devices are limited to life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. All of the governing bodies with responsibility over the Company’s products have the ability to inspect medical device manufacturers, order recalls of medical devices in some circumstances, seize non-complying medical devices, and to pursue prosecution of either civil or criminal violations.
 
Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, requires individuals or companies manufacturing medical devices intended for human use to file a notice with the FDA at least ninety days before intending to introduce the device into the market. This notice, commonly referred to as a 510(k) premarket notification, must identify the type of classified device into which the product falls, the class of that type, and a specific product already being marketed or cleared by the FDA and to which the product is “substantially equivalent.” In some instances, the 510(k) must include data from human clinical studies to establish “substantial equivalence.” The FDA must agree with the claim of “substantial equivalence” before the device can be marketed. The statutory time frame for clearance of a 510(k) is ninety days, though it often takes longer. Nuo Therapeutics currently markets only products that are subject to 510(k) clearance.

The Company currently markets the Aurix System, consisting of the Aurix Wound Dressing Kit, Aurix Reagent Kit, and Aurix System Centrifuge II. Each System’s component is a legally-marketed product that has been cleared by FDA and/or the appropriate governing body. The Aurix System Centrifuge II, when used with the Aurix Wound Dressing Kit and Aurix Reagent Kit, are suitable for use on exuding wounds such as leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and diabetic ulcers, and for the management of mechanically or surgically-debrided wounds.
 
As a specification developer, manufacturer and distributor of medical devices, Nuo Therapeutics complies with, among other standards and regulations, e.g., the FDCA and implementing regulations at 21 CFR et seq. and ISO 13485. As a manufacturer and distributor of medical devices, the Company, and in some instances its subcontractors, is required to register its facilities and products manufactured annually with the appropriate governing bodies and certain state agencies. Additionally, the Company is subject to periodic inspections by the governing bodies to assess compliance with cGMP regulations. Facilities may also be subject to inspections by other federal, foreign, state or local agencies. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 
Bio-pharmaceutical Product Regulation
 
To the extent the Company again develops bio-pharmaceuticals, such as its former ALDH Bright Cells product candidates, in the future, they would also be regulated by the FDA. Under the U.S. regulatory scheme, the development process for new such products can be divided into two distinct phases:

● | Preclinical Phase. The preclinical phase involves the discovery, characterization, product formulation and animal testing necessary to prepare an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for submission to the FDA. The IND must be accepted by the FDA before the product candidate can be tested in humans. The review period for an IND submission is thirty days, after which, if no comments are made by the FDA, the product candidate can be studied in Phase I clinical trials. Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clinical Phase. The clinical phase of development follows a successful IND submission and involves the activities necessary to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and dosage of the product candidate in humans, as well as, the ability to manufacture the drug in accordance with cGMP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used in assessing the safety and the efficacy of the product candidate. Each clinical protocol is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND prior to beginning the trial. Each trial is reviewed, approved, and conducted under the auspices of an investigational review board, or IRB, and each trial, with limited exceptions, must include the patient’s informed consent. Typically, clinical evaluation involves the following time-consuming and costly three-phase sequential process:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 1. In Phase 1 clinical trials, typically a small number of healthy individuals (although in some instances individuals with the disease or condition for which an indication is being sought for the product candidate are enrolled) are tested with the product candidate to determine safety and tolerability, and includes biological analyses to determine the availability and metabolism of the active ingredient following administration.
Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials involve administering the product candidate to individuals who suffer from the target disease or condition to determine the optimal dose and potential efficacy. These clinical trials are well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects.
Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting efficacy of a product candidate has been obtained and safety, tolerability, and an optimal dosing regimen have been established. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to gather additional information about efficacy and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship and to complete the information needed to provide adequate instructions for the use of the product candidate. Phase 3 trials usually include from several hundred to a few thousand subjects.
 
Throughout the clinical phase, samples of the product made in different batches are tested for stability to establish shelf-life constraints. In addition, large-scale production protocols and written standard operating procedures for each aspect of commercial manufacture and testing must be developed. These trials require scale up for manufacture of increasingly larger batches of bulk chemical. These batches require validation analyses to confirm the consistent composition of the product.
 
 10


Phase 1, 2, and 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend (place on “clinical hold”), or terminate the trials based upon the data accumulated to that point and the agency’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. The FDA may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA can also request that additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval. Additionally, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of products under development. Furthermore, IRBs, which are independent entities constituted to protect human subjects at the institutions in which clinical trials are being conducted, have the authority to suspend clinical trials at their respective institutions at any time for a variety of reasons, including safety issues. 
 
After the successful completion of Phase 3 clinical trials, the sponsor of the new bio-pharmaceutical submits a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the FDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. A BLA is a comprehensive, multi-volume application that includes, among other things, the results of all preclinical studies and clinical trials, information about the product candidate’s composition and manufacturing, and the sponsor’s plans for manufacturing, packaging, and labeling the drug. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an application also is required to include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and efficacy of product candidates for all relevant pediatric populations before the BLA is submitted. The statute provides for waivers or deferrals in certain situations. In most cases, the BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. In return, the FDA assigns a goal of 10 months from acceptance of the application to return of a first “complete response,” in which the FDA may approve the product or request additional information.
 
The submission of the application is no guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. The FDA reviews all BLA’s submitted before it accepts them for filing. It may refuse to accept the application and request additional information rather than accept the application for filing, in which case, the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information. After the application is deemed filed and accepted by the FDA, agency staff reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and efficacious for its intended use. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with an applicant’s interpretation of the data submitted in its BLA. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of physicians, for review, evaluation, and an approval recommendation. The FDA is not bound by the opinion of the advisory committee. Products that successfully complete BLA review and receive clearance (i.e., approval) may be marketed in the U.S., subject to all conditions imposed by the FDA.
 
Prior to granting approval, the FDA conducts an inspection of the facilities, including outsourced facilities, that will be involved in the manufacture, production, packaging, testing, and control of the product candidate for cGMP compliance. The FDA will not approve the application unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If FDA determines that the marketing application, manufacturing process, or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and will often request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the marketing application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the application by issuing a “complete response” letter communicating it cannot approve the application in its current form. The length of the FDA’s review may range from a few months to several years.
 
If the FDA approves the BLA, the product becomes available for physicians to prescribe in the U.S. After approval, the BLA holder is still subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record keeping requirements, submitting periodic reports to the FDA, reporting of any adverse experiences with the product, and complying with drug sampling and distribution requirements. In addition, the BLA holder is required to maintain and provide updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA. The BLA holder is also required to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling, including prohibitions against promoting any non-FDA approved or “off-label” indications of products. Failure to comply with those requirements could result in significant enforcement action by the FDA, including warning letters, orders to pull the promotional materials, and substantial fines. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval.
 
Biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities and products manufactured annually with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to assess compliance with cGMP regulations. Facilities may also be subject to inspections by other federal, foreign, state or local agencies. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 
In addition, following the FDA approval of a product, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved marketing application, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary or the FDA-initiated action that could delay further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contra-indications. Also, the FDA may require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or effectiveness, including additional clinical studies, known as Phase 4 trials, to evaluate long-term effects.
 
Other regulatory agencies, including Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency, require preclinical and clinical studies, manufacturing validation, facilities inspection, and post-approval record keeping and reporting similar to FDA requirements. In some instances, data generated for consideration by the FDA may be submitted to these agencies for their consideration for approvals in other countries.

Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
The Company may also be indirectly subject to federal and state anti-kickback and physician self-referral laws. Federal physician self-referral legislation (commonly known as the Stark Law) prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral, and any person collecting any amounts in connection with an unlawful referral is obligated to refund such amounts. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or “CMS,” has issued numerous regulations containing exceptions to the prohibitions of the Stark Law. If a physician and a DHS entity have financial relationship subject to the Stark Law, then an exception must be met or else the DHS entity cannot bill for the service. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. The penalties for violating the Stark Law also include civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per referral and possible exclusion from federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the Stark Law have also been the basis for False Claims Act actions, discussed below. Various states have corollary laws to the Stark Law (so-called “baby Stark” laws), including laws that require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a health care provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider. Both the scope and exception for such laws vary from state to state.
 
The Company may also be subject to federal and state anti-kickback laws. Section 1128B (b) of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Law, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Law is broad, and it prohibits many arrangements and practices that are otherwise lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. The Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, has issued regulations, commonly known as “safe harbors” that set forth certain provisions which, if fully met, will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Law. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Law, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Law will be pursued. The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Law include imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $250,000 per violation for individuals and up to $500,000 per violation for companies and possible exclusion from federal health care programs. As with the Stark Law, violations of the Anti-Kickback Law can result in a False Claims Act action. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Law, and some of these state prohibitions apply to patients for health care services reimbursed by any source, not only federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In this connection, please refer to the Risk Factor titled "The 20% Medicare Co-Payment Presents a Potential Obstacle to Adequate Levels of Patient Enrollment in the CED Protocols." 
 
In addition, there are other U.S. health care fraud laws to which the Company may be subject, one which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payers (“fraud on a health benefit plan”) and one which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. These laws apply to any health benefit plan, not just Medicare and Medicaid. 
 
The Company may also be subject to other U.S. laws which prohibit submitting, or causing to be submitted, claims for payment or causing such claims to be submitted that are false. Violation of these false claims statutes may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health programs. These statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits the knowing filing of a false claim (or causing the submission of a false claim) or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the U.S. federal government. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the failure to report and refund an overpayment to the Medicare or Medicaid programs within 60 days of the identification of the overpayment may also be an obligation subjecting the defendant to a False Claims Act action. Finally, a recent U.S. Supreme Court case, Universal Health Services v. United States ex rel. Escobar, approved the “implied false certification” theory under which a defendant submits a claim for payment that makes a specific representation about the goods or services provider, but fails to disclose the defendant’s noncompliance with a statutory, regulatory or contractual requirement that would be material to the Government’s payment decision. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim. These amounts are likely to increase dramatically in accordance with the provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, under which the U.S. Department of Justice adjusted for inflation civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced by components of the Department. This change will increase the per claim penalty range to $10,781-$21,563. Suits filed under the False Claims Act can be brought by an individual on behalf of the government (a “qui tam action”). Such individuals (known as “qui tam relators”) may share in the amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition certain states have enacted laws modeled after the False Claims Act. “Qui tam” actions have increased significantly in recent years causing greater numbers of health care companies to have to defend false claim actions, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state health care programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.
 
 12


Several states also have referral, fee splitting and other similar laws that may restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration in connection with the purchase or rental of medical equipment and supplies. State laws vary in scope and have been infrequently interpreted by courts and regulatory agencies, but may apply to all health care products and services, regardless of whether Medicaid or Medicare funds are involved.
 
Employees
 
The Company had 15 employees, all of which were full time employees, including the Company’s management, as of December 31, 2017. The remaining personnel primarily consist of accounting, clinical affairs, operations, sales, and administrative professionals. None of the Company’s employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we spent approximately $1.3 million and $1.6 million on research and development activities, respectively. 
 
Competition
 
While Aurix has no direct competition in the chronic wound care market from any other FDA cleared platelet derived products, we face competition from pharmaceutical companies, biopharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, and other competitors in the areas of advanced wound care dressings, wound care devices, and wound care biologics. Leading companies in the advanced wound care market include Smith and Nephew, Acelity (KCI, Systegenix, and LifeCell), MoInlycke, and ConvaTec.  Leading competitors in the wound care market that offer other biologic products such as tissue based products include companies such as MiMedx, Osiris, Organogenesis, Aliqua, Derma Sciences, as well as a significant number of smaller companies.  While we believe that Aurix can compete favorably on the basis of broad application across multiple wound etiologies, we expect that many physicians and allied professionals will continue to employ other treatment approaches and technologies, separately and in combination, in an attempt to treat chronic and hard-to heal wounds.  The chronic wound market has many therapies that compete with Aurix that have established habitual use patterns and provider contracts to encourage standardized use.  Furthermore, other companies have developed or are developing products that could be in direct future competition with our current product line.   We may not be able to compete effectively against such companies in the future. Many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources, larger marketing staffs and more experience in commercializing products than we do. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Relating to the Company’s Financial Position, Business and Industry - Our Products Have Existing Competition in the Marketplace.”
 
Raw Materials
 
A reagent used for our Aurix product, bovine thrombin (Thrombin JMI), is available exclusively through Pfizer. Pfizer may unilaterally raise the price for the reagent. If a temporary or permanent interruption in the supply of the reagent were to occur, or the manufacturing costs charged by Pfizer exceed what we can reasonably afford, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.
