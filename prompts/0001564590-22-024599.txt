Item 1. Business. 
Introduction 
 Sonim Technologies, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Delaware on August 5, 1999 and is headquartered in Austin, Texas. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and “Sonim” refer to Sonim Technologies, Inc. and its wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries. 
Overview
 We are a leading U.S. provider of ultra-rugged mobile devices, including phones and accessories designed specifically for task workers physically engaged in their work environments, often in mission-critical roles. We currently sell our ruggedized mobile phones and accessories to the three largest wireless carriers in the United States— AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon—as well as the three largest wireless carriers in Canada—Bell, Rogers and Telus Mobility. We also sell our ruggedized phones and accessories through distribution channels in North America, South America and Europe. Our devices and accessories connect workers with voice, data and workflow applications in two end markets: industrial enterprise and public sector.
 Task workers in these end markets have historically been limited to pen and paper, older radio technology and/or single-purpose electronic devices, such as barcode scanners, location-tracking devices and sensors, to accomplish specific tasks. These single-purpose devices have historically operated on proprietary networks, such as Land Mobile Radio 94 or LMR networks that enable Push-to-Talk or PTT services for voice communications. We provide communication devices that consolidate and integrate multiple functions including PTT, into a single ruggedized solution running on commercial wireless networks at a total cost of ownership that we believe is significantly lower than other solutions and that provides improved productivity and safety of task workers.
 Our solutions include ultra-rugged mobile phones that are capable of attaching to both public and private wireless networks, industrial-grade accessories that meet the requirements of specific applications, and software applications and cloud-based tools that provide management and deployment services to our customers. We tightly integrate PTT capabilities into both the hardware and software of our mobile phones, including a dedicated hard key that can initiate a PTT call even if the phone is in a sleep-state. End customers of our solutions include construction, energy and utility, hospitality, logistics, manufacturing, public sector and transportation entities that primarily purchase our devices and accessories through their wireless carriers. The key attributes of our solutions are specifically tailored for the needs of our end users, including impact resistance, waterproof, chemical resistant, and dustproof construction, extended battery life and extra loud audio, supported by a three-year comprehensive warranty. All of our devices run on the Android operating system, providing a familiar and intuitive user interface, and our smartphones have access to a library of millions of applications available through the Google Play Store. We have also implemented dozens of application programming interfaces, or APIs, specific to our mobile phones and have partnered with third-party application developers to create a purpose-built experience for our end users using these applications on our mobile phones. This includes working with the leading providers of PTT and mission-critical-PTT, or MCPTT applications to deliver a seamless instant communications experience.
 We currently have stocked phone and accessory products with the three largest U.S. wireless carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, meaning that these carriers test and certify our mobile phones on their networks and maintain inventory in their warehouses that they then sell through their enterprise and retail sales teams to end customers, often on a subsidized or financed basis. Our full product portfolio has also been stocked with the three largest Canadian wireless carriers since 2015. In 2021, we sold approximately 24,000 mobile phones in Canada and 197,000 in the United States.
 We enter into master sales arrangements with carriers (including channel partners contributing over 89% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021) under which our partners purchase our solutions for distribution on a purchase order basis. Under these arrangements, we and the channel partners determine sales channel distribution in connection with pricing (including any discounts and price protection) and market positioning of each particular mobile phone product. We also offer our channel partners channel marketing and other promotional incentives, such as sales volume incentives, in exchange for retail price reductions. We may also offer Non-Recurring Engineering, or NRE services in the form of third-party design services relating to the design of materials and software licenses used in the manufacturing of our products. In both years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately 76% of our revenues were derived from our top four customers. We expect our revenues to continue to be heavily concentrated among our top customers, and the loss of, or significant reduction in orders from, any of these customers could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely impact our operating result.
 For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our revenues were $54.6 million and $64.0 million, respectively.  For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our net loss was $38.6 million and $29.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, revenues from our top four customers were $42 million and $49 million, respectively.

COVID-19 Pandemic 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and work force participation and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. As a result of the pandemic, including the introduction of new variants of COVID-19, our workforce shifted to operating in a primarily remote working environment, which has created productivity, connectivity, and oversight challenges. We have been experiencing and expect to continue to experience supply chain delays and higher shipping costs. The effects of the ongoing pandemic are unpredictable, and as a result we may experience increased costs and/or disruption as long as the pandemic persists. 
Our Industry
 Communication, data collection, productivity and safety among task workers has always been a central requirement in business-critical and mission-critical environments. Organizations with remote and disparate workers—from police and firefighters to construction, oil rig, logistics and manufacturing workers—need an extremely durable solution that provides reliable and secure voice, data and workflow applications. Historically, task workers had limited options, and in many cases resorted to using pen and paper. In the 1930s, public safety organizations introduced LMR networks that enabled PTT services, allowing workers to instantly and reliably initiate communications. In the 1970s, proprietary bar code scanners and other proprietary single-purpose tools were introduced to assist task workers in accomplishing specific tasks. In addition, in the mid-1990s, Nextel’s iDEN service provided organizations the benefits of PTT without the upfront equipment and infrastructure investments required with LMR. The advent and proliferation of LTE and advancements in smartphone technologies led to the start of the decommissioning of the Nextel iDEN network in the United States by Sprint in 2013. These developments paved the way for commercial wireless carriers to deliver mobility solutions that enhance the speed, reliability and durability of those offered by traditional LMR networks and other proprietary devices and applications.
 The global market for rugged handhelds and rugged smartphones continues to grow and we believe that the use of consumer phones in line-of-business applications provides an attractive market opportunity. Ruggedized mobile phones are well suited for industrial enterprise and other critical infrastructure applications due to their durability and functionality in a range of environments. Equipping workers with smarter mobile phones also helps enable more efficient communication with and between field employees and enhance the information that decision-makers use to deploy resources within their organizations. The PTT over cellular network market, such as rugged phones on LTE with integrated PTT functions, has been steadily growing, in part as a replacement for aging LMR systems. The migration of a large base of legacy Windows-based handheld devices to Android continues to be a growth driver for rugged handhelds.
 Industrial Enterprise Market Opportunity
 Within the industrial enterprise market, we primarily focus on providing our solutions for business-critical tasks. In the United States and Canada there are task workers across verticals in our industrial enterprise end market, including transportation and logistics, construction, manufacturing, facilities management and energy and utility, who could benefit from our products. The extreme durability, and enhanced voice and text communication capabilities of our devices, enable these workers to be stationed in remote and hazardous environments, while remaining connected to their central command center at all times.
 The functionality and durability requirements for workers in the industrial enterprise market significantly differ from that provided by a consumer-focused mobile device. Our solutions provide enterprises with the ability to centrally manage, and control device functions and data stored on the phone remotely. Enterprises seeking to reduce their operating expenses by optimizing workflows can enhance their workers’ productivity by leveraging specialized, purpose-built rugged platforms with functions such as PTT, location tracking and extra-loud audio. These features are especially crucial for business-critical applications across the industrial enterprise.
 Public Sector Market Opportunities
 Historically, U.S. public safety agencies and other critical infrastructure entities like utilities and municipalities have utilized rugged two-way radios running on proprietary LMR networks to ensure reliable and immediate communication. As these closed networks were locally funded, built and controlled, they were designed not to be interoperable across cities and states and other agencies. Over time, these users have incrementally augmented their LMR radios with mobile devices running on commercial wireless networks. These mobile devices enabled public-safety officers to gather real-time information, collected across multiple systems, and to respond and react to changing circumstances.
 On September 11, 2001, many firefighters perished in part due to the lack of interoperability between the LMR systems of the multiple responding agencies in New York City and surrounding areas. Additionally, commercial cellular communications were halted due to the significant increase in call volumes. Based on the 9/11 Commission Report’s recommendations, Congress passed

legislation in 2012 to establish the First Responder Network Authority under the Department of Commerce, which was tasked with deploying a nationwide public safety broadband network.
 In March 2017, the Department of Commerce and the First Responder Network Authority awarded AT&T a contract to build, maintain and operate a nationwide high-speed broadband network for public safety, or FirstNet, for 25 years. The contract provided AT&T with 20 MHz of spectrum and $7 billion in funding to support this network and established subscriber targets, milestone buildouts and disincentive fees to help ensure that AT&T fulfills its commitments to public safety. The contract provides AT&T a 25-year lease of FirstNet Band 14 spectrum subject to AT&T enlisting a minimum number of emergency responders across the United States. As of October 2021, FirstNet (Built with AT&T) had signed approximately 18,500 public safety agencies, representing approximately 2.8 million FirstNet connections.
 Due to AT&T’s focus on growing its number of public safety users, other major U.S. wireless carriers including T-Mobile and Verizon have been focused on establishing and defending their market positions, creating a highly competitive market for public safety users among the major U.S. wireless carriers.
 We introduced our first devices that supported FirstNet, XP8 and XP5s, in the first quarter of 2018, and XP3 the second quarter of 2019. Through our partnerships with wireless carriers that provide FirstNet and similar networks, as well as wireless carriers seeking to obtain market share through other dedicated cellular networks, we believe we are in a strong position to provide our ruggedized solutions through these channel partners to the public safety market as these competing public safety networks mature. We intend to continue to leverage our access to end customers and end users on public safety networks to increase brand awareness and become the favored provider for ruggedized solutions across the public safety market generally. We believe that the general momentum to convert to cellular based systems from LMR, either dedicated or prioritized for public safety, is a global trend as Western European countries and Australia are considering similar wireless networks.

 As a result of these key attributes, we believe that our ruggedized, purpose-built mobile phones can increase the productivity of task workers and significantly reduce total cost of ownership for entities deploying our solutions.
 Our Strategy
  
• | Reorganize Company to achieve growth and profitability. Since November 2019, our management team has endeavored to reorganize the company into a leaner, lower cost organization focused on a path to growth and profitability. The Company has reduced its global headcount from approximately 500 employees at year end 2019 to a headcount of 102 of which 77 are full time employees and 25 contractors as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, we have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing functions, software development and quality control functions to third parties, transferring the employees who previously performed this work to such third parties. During 2020 and 2021, we decided to proceed with future product co-development and manufacturing with Original Design Manufacturing, or ODM partners. To ensure the efficient manufacturing of our legacy products through this transition, we outsourced our final assembly to a supply chain partner and transferred employees to that partner to enhance their efficiency in taking over our production work. We have also relocated our headquarters from San Mateo, California to Austin, Texas. We believe that restructuring the company positions us to stabilize its operations and invest for future growth.

Our Target Markets
 We believe our solutions can improve communication reliability, operational efficiency and safety for end customers and task workers in both commercial and public sectors. Our ruggedized mobility solutions target two end markets: industrial enterprise and public sector. 
Industrial Enterprise
 Transportation and Logistics. Enterprises and fleet workers across supply chain, delivery services and field management rely on mobile devices to operate safely and efficiently in environments that are often susceptible to inclement weather. For enterprises looking to improve supply chain functionality, our mobile resource management applications such as location tracking, mileage tracking, and job dispatch can help businesses monitor operations more efficiently. We believe that a weather-resistant and long-battery ruggedized device, combined with productivity applications and services with the native camera on our XP8 smartphone—provides reliable communication options for transportation and logistics workers. In addition, our solutions reduce the number of devices and tools that these task workers would need to carry in the field by consolidating the functionality of multiple single-purpose devices into one purpose-built mobile device.
 Construction. We offer workers in the construction industry crush-, puncture-, scratch- and impact-resistant devices, which we believe to be crucial in environments where there is a high risk of such occurrences. Jobsites also value the PTT capabilities that are tightly integrated into Sonim devices. Additionally, we believe our phones and related accessories help promote worker safety and productivity, with support for lone-worker safety applications and with features such as extended battery life and extra loud-speakers. For business decision-makers, we offer devices with consolidated functionality, which enables a total cost of ownership that we believe is significantly lower versus comparable offerings that enable real-time reporting. This can help eliminate costly delays by capturing verbal, visual and location data from job sites more efficiently.
 Manufacturing. As market demand and competition in the manufacturing sector require more nimble production lines, equipment for reliable communication and safety standard compliance are necessary to improve efficiency and keep workers safe. Our devices’ PTT functionality and extra-loud speakerphones are designed to keep lines of communication open and functional in fast-changing and loud environments, while our glove-friendly touch screen displays allow for workers to have access to real-time data, thus reducing production down time. Additionally, our devices are designed to survive blunt force and can be sanitized and sterilized for safe use in food or medical processing facilities. We believe that these features can enhance the productivity of workers in the manufacturing industry.
 Facilities Management. Service-based operations in large indoor and outdoor facilities require management of mobile teams. Our mobile phones consolidate radio, guard tour verification, panic button systems and scanners, which otherwise would require separate and single-purpose equipment. Our devices can improve business operations through functionalities such as automated work order dispatch and job completion verification tools delivered via proprietary third-party applications integrated with our devices.
 Energy and Utility. The safety standards for mobile phones used in the energy and utility industry are more stringent due to the reactive characteristics of the natural resources being procured and serviced, as well as the potentially high-voltage or explosive environments. We believe we are uniquely positioned to serve these workers because a number of our devices are designed for use in potentially explosive or hazardous environments (rated Non-Incendive or Intrinsically Safe by either the CSA Group, ATEX or IECEx notified bodies), and their resistance to various chemicals and extreme temperatures. Reliable communication devices are often mission- critical for workers to stay safe while performing energy- and utility-related operations.
 Public Sector
 Public Safety. In the United States, AT&T’s FirstNet network and Verizon’s public safety prioritization provide optimized networks for this sector. Through our partnerships with the major wireless carriers, we believe we are in a strong position to provide mission-critical solutions to the public safety market as public safety networks mature. Through enhanced communication capabilities, we believe our devices can decrease the response time of first responders and help public safety workers stay safe and connected in hazardous, isolated or emergency conditions. We believe that the durability of our phones combined with their purpose-built functionality, provide a lower total cost of ownership compared to similar products, which is highly attractive to city and state decision-makers.

Sales and Marketing
 As of December 31, 2021, our sales and marketing team consisted of 18 professionals located in the United States, Canada and Europe. We sell our products directly to wireless carriers, through distributors and resellers and directly to end customers. Our marketing efforts consist of product marketing, channel partner/carrier marketing and corporate marketing. Product marketing focuses on ensuring that carrier requirements related to product specifications are in-line with our brand requirements. Channel partner marketing focuses on go-to-market strategy as well as developing supplemental sales tools, carrier and non-carrier marketing campaigns, industry trade show materials and brand awareness. Corporate marketing consists of public relations, social and digital marketing and lead generation operations.
Manufacturing
 Prior to January 2021, we directly managed the procurement of all final assembly materials used in our products, which include LCDs, housings, camera modules and antennas. In addition, we completed the final assembly of our devices in our Shenzhen, China facility.  During 2020, we decided to proceed with future product co-development and manufacturing with ODM partners.  To ensure the efficient manufacturing of our legacy products through this transition, we outsourced our final assembly to a supply chain partner and transferred employees to that partner to enhance their efficiency in taking over our production work.
 In our final assembly facility and our manufacturing partner’s facility, devices are assembled and undergo quality assurance procedures across three production lines. The assembly of each of our products requires over 800 components, primarily related to mounting components onto circuit boards, and requires multiple custom components for ruggedization of the device, which includes housing, display and glass lens, printed circuit board assembly, camera function, battery, speakers and unique accessory ports, among others. Some of the components used to assemble our products are custom-made and obtained through single-source suppliers.

The Company is closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 global outbreak and its resulting impact on our manufacturing operations and supply chain, with its top priority being the health and safety of its employees, customers, partners, and communities. During 2020, our manufacturing lines were closed for four weeks due to COVID-19 protocols established by the Chinese government.  Since that time, we have had no material interruptions of production.
 Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive environment serving end customers in the industrial enterprise and public sector markets. These markets are highly fragmented, evolving and increasingly competitive. Competition in our industry is intense and has been characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, significant barriers to entry in the form of carrier certification requirements, frequent new product introductions, annual operating system changes and rapid changes in end user requirements.
 Non-rugged mobile device manufacturers have not historically created devices specifically to compete in the industrial enterprise and public sector markets.  These manufacturers typically focus on a different consumer audience and the requirements to manufacture ruggedized phones differ significantly from their core products.  Nevertheless, we face competition from manufacturers of non-rugged mobile phones such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, or Samsung. to the extent end users decide to purchase traditional devices and add a rugged case for use in environments that we believe are better suited for purpose built ruggedized mobile phones. We also face competition from manufacturers of rugged mobile phones such as Samsung, Bullitt Mobile Ltd. and Kyocera Corporation as well as from large system integrators and manufacturers of private and public wireless network equipment and devices. Competitors in this space include Harris Corporation, JVC KENWOOD Corporation, Motorola Solutions, Inc. and Tait International Limited. For the Data Capture and RFID portion of our product offerings, competitors include companies that provide a broad portfolio of barcode scanning products that are suitable for the majority of global market applications, such as Datalogic USA, Inc., Honeywell International Inc., Panasonic Corporation, Socket Mobile and Zebra Technologies Corporation.
 We believe the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products are the products’ performance, features (including security features), quality, design innovation, reliability, price, customer service, reputation in the industry, brand loyalty and a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem. We believe that our strongest competitive advantages are our products’ durability and reputation in the industry, as well as the push to talk capabilities not available in all competitive devices.  Additionally, we believe our XP8 rugged smartphone is one of the most rugged smartphones made anywhere in the world and it is consequently able to be fully sterilized and cleaned. In order to compete, we will be required to continue to respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of technological changes and our competitors’ innovations.
 With regard to competition from LMR providers, traditional LMR providers have chosen to not fully enter the LTE market primarily to avoid harming their significant existing LMR business. For example, certain major LMR providers have historically achieved over $3.0 billion in annual revenues from device sales. Further, these LMR providers typically do not have stocked products with major U.S. and Canadian wireless carriers. Achieving stocked product status with the wireless carriers requires that a manufacturer incur substantial cost and maintain technical know-how regarding carrier certification requirements. Stocking products at the wireless carriers may also result in competition against existing dealers for LMR providers, with certain such providers transacting with over 700 dealers in North America.
 Intellectual Property
 Our competitiveness and future success are dependent on our ability to protect our own proprietary technology and to access other important intellectual property. We protect our freedom to operate in the markets and mitigate intellectual property costs by proactively securing licenses with key patent holders, filing our own patents, trademarks, and copyrights and participating in defensive patent pools. As of December 31, 2021, we held 17 utility and design patents in the United States and 11 outside the United States and have filed 1 utility and design patent applications in the United States. We also have contractual rights to standard essential patents for 2G, 3G, and 4G wireless technologies, some of which require significant royalty payments. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we held 16 trademarks in the United States and 17 trademarks outside the United States and have filed 9 trademark applications in the United States and 11 outside the United States. We opportunistically negotiate licenses with other patent holders where appropriate for our technology.
 Our products are built to conform to wireless standards which are covered by numerous essential patents held by third parties. Our wireless carriers require us to provide patent indemnification for the products we sell to them, and in turn we secure intellectual property indemnification from our suppliers.

We do not believe that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of any third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our channel partners and end customers with respect to current or future products. In the past, we have had third parties assert exclusive patent or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into a royalty or licensing agreement, any of which could delay the development and commercialization of our products.
 Our smartphone devices use the standard Android operating system and our feature phones use an operating system based on the Android Open Source Project. We additionally integrate third-party licensed software on commercially reasonable terms. Several Android-based apps and extension enablers of Android are developed internally by our employees.
 Certain License Agreements
 In September 2008, we entered into a multi-year patent license agreement, as amended in January 2019, or the Nokia Agreement, with Nokia Corporation, or Nokia, pursuant to which Nokia granted us a license to certain Nokia-owned cellular standard essential patents for our devices that include such cellular standard technology. 
 In January 2017, we entered into an amended and restated global patent license agreement, as amended in December 2018, or the Ericsson Agreement, with Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (Publ), or Ericsson, pursuant to which Ericsson granted us a license under certain Ericsson patents to manufacture and sell mobile phones that comply with certain telecommunications standards. Under the agreement, we made a one-time payment to Ericsson to partially settle royalty arrears and are obligated to pay Ericsson (i) single-digit U.S. dollar amounts per unit, which amounts are based on the particular product sold and the standards with which such products are compliant, and (ii) quarterly payments to cover the remaining royalty arrears. The Ericsson Agreement continues until January 1, 2024, unless terminated earlier by the parties. Ericsson has the right to terminate in the event (i) we materially breach the agreement and do not cure such breach within 30 days, or (ii) in the event of a change of control of our company, where the successor does not agree to the terms of the agreement. Further, Ericsson may terminate certain rights under the agreement with respect to third-party manufacturers if a third-party manufacturer files an infringement suit relating to any patents owned by Ericsson.
 Legislation and Regulation
 Wireless communication devices use radio spectrum, which is regulated by government agencies throughout the world. In the United States, use of spectrum is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, for non-federal government entities and federal government entities, respectively. The FCC and NTIA allocate spectrum for various uses, including commercial wireless services and public safety services, and regulate the use of that spectrum and the devices, such as our products, that operate on that spectrum. The FCC and NTIA also adopt requirements that affect wireless equipment, such as limits on radio emissions and rules requiring that handsets have specified capabilities, such as providing location information to 911 operators. The FCC also regulates the testing and certification for the import and/or sale of certain wireless devices.
 Other countries also have regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for using radio spectrum, pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the International Telecommunications Union. Our ability to manufacture and sell products in other countries could be affected by such rules. In addition, any significant variations between the rules in the United States and rules in other countries, including differences in available spectrum bands for wireless communication, could increase the costs of designing and manufacturing our products.
 Research and Development
 We allocate significant resources and funds to developing robust and innovative solutions for the end users of our products and ensuring that these solutions meet their exacting requirements for functionality and reliability. Our research and development initiatives are led by our internal teams and are supported by third-party original design manufacturers as needed. Our product management team and our sales and marketing team spend their time interacting with a combination of end users and IT administrators in our target markets, wireless carriers and application and accessory ecosystem partners to better understand the market requirements for our solution. Once defined, our engineering organization develops and tests the solution against these requirements and works to achieve technical certification and approval from the wireless carriers which allows the solutions to be sold to our end users.
