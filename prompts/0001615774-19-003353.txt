Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company formed pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware on June 11, 2018 for the purpose of entering into a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to in this report as the initial business combination. While our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial business combination are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region, we have initially focused our search on companies that have experienced and emerged from a financial restructuring, as described below.
 
In September 2018, our sponsor purchased 4,312,500 founders’ shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. Our sponsor subsequently transferred certain founders’ shares to our independent directors at the same price originally paid for such shares. In December 2018, our sponsor forfeited 575,000 founders’ shares. Following the expiration of the underwriters’ over-allotment option on January 24, 2019, our sponsor forfeited 487,500 shares, so that our initial stockholders continue to own 20% of our issued and outstanding shares after our initial public offering.
 
The registration statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on December 10, 2018. On December 13, 2018, we consummated our initial public offering of 13,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $130,000,000. 
 
Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 4,150,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant in a private placement to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $4,150,000 (the “private placement”).
 
Immediately following the closing of our initial public offering, a total of $130,000,000 ($10.00 per unit) of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “trust account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and has been invested only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions of paragraph (d) under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below, except that interest earned on the trust account can be released to pay all of our franchise and income taxes and for dissolution or liquidation expenses up to $150,000, as applicable.
 
Transaction costs amounted to $3,158,259, consisting of $2,600,000 of underwriting fees, and $558,259 of other costs. As of December 31, 2018, $922,219 of cash was held outside of the trust account, available for working capital purposes.
 
On January 7, 2019, we announced that the holders of our units may elect to separately trade the common stock and warrants included in the units commencing on January 9, 2019 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “SAMA” and “SAMAW,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “SAMAU.”
 
Business Strategy
 
Our sponsor is an affiliate of Schultze Asset Management, an alternative investment management firm founded in 1998 that focuses on distressed, special situation and event-driven securities. Schultze Asset Management’s investment objective is to achieve exceptional risk-adjusted capital appreciation through investments in various securities of companies in financial and/or legal distress or which have recently emerged from financial reorganizations or lawsuits. Since inception, the firm has invested over $3.2 billion in investments across numerous market cycles. At the core of the firm’s strategy is deep-rooted, credit and equity-based fundamental analysis, leveraging the team’s distressed, legal, bankruptcy and financial expertise. Schultze Asset Management believes that distressed securities can often be purchased at discounts to intrinsic value given the complexities surrounding their restructuring. The firm complements its liquid investment strategy with illiquid investments where it has taken an active approach to managing such investments often through participation on credit committees, liquidating trusts and board positions. The firm has successfully deployed its active investment strategy in 11 companies involving over $450.0 million of invested capital.

Schultze Asset Management and members of our management team have significant experience in identifying, investing in and operating businesses that have successfully emerged from a financial re-organization. We believe our affiliation with Schultze Asset Management and the significant financial and operational restructuring expertise of our team provide us with important competitive advantages for sourcing, pursuing and evaluating an initial business combination within our target universe.
 
We have initially focused on pursuing acquisitions of target companies that have completed and emerged from a financial restructuring, which may have included a Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection filing. Owners of post-restructuring companies typically benefit from a significant reduction in liabilities including lower financial indebtedness, employee benefit obligations, litigation liabilities, contractual commitments and a generally lower operating cost structure. Such target companies often have underexploited opportunities for continued growth as a result of prior under-investment. Further, management teams often exit restructurings with increased financial and operating discipline and with meaningful equity ownership. Given the inefficiencies that exist in the post-reorganization market, we believe a business combination within our target universe can be completed at a discount to its intrinsic value and publicly-traded peers.
 
We believe a business combination through a blank check company provides meaningful benefits to owners of post-reorganization companies, with whom we seek to transact with, and our investors. Owners of post-reorganization companies are often former creditors, including banks, who are not natural owners of equity securities. We believe a business combination with us may provide a significant monetization event for owners desiring liquidity as well as continued equity participation for those desiring continued ownership. Further, target companies can benefit from access to a public vehicle to support organic and inorganic growth initiatives by combining with us. Our investors can benefit from ownership in a business with significantly reduced liabilities, an enhanced operating structure and a highly motivated management team.
 
Following our initial business combination, we intend to assist the target company in creating shareholder value which may include through board and/or senior management representation. As a result of our team’s experience, we believe we can add value post-transaction to ensure proper corporate governance and alignment of management incentives, develop an operational and financial strategy to pursue continued organic and inorganic growth initiatives and to assist with capital raising and capital structure optimization.
 
The past performance of Schultze Asset Management, the members of our management team or their affiliates is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of the performance of Schultze Asset Management, our management or any of their affiliates as indicative of our future performance.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy of focusing on those targets which have completed a financial restructuring and can be valued at a discount to their intrinsic value and publicly-traded peers, we have identified the following additional general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet any of these criteria and guidelines.

● | Enterprise Value: We intend to focus our efforts on seeking and completing an initial business combination with an enterprise that has a value of between $400.0 million to $1.0 billion;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Financial Well-Being: We expect to primarily target an initial business combination with a fundamentally sound company which was previously financially troubled, which can often occur through previously excessive leverage, challenging industry conditions, material litigation, regulatory shifts, macroeconomic events, performance disruptions, lack of management execution or any combination thereof;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leading Industry Market Position: We intend to pursue companies whose products or services have leading positions within their respective markets with sustainable competitive advantages and natural barriers to market entry;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Solid Free Cash Flow Generation: We seek to acquire an established company with attractive operating margins, strong free cash flow generation and solid recurring revenue streams;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Management Team: We seek to acquire a target business with an experienced management team and a proven track record of execution;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Favorable Industry Outlook: We seek to acquire a target business where the end user markets of such target business’ products or services have a favorable growth outlook, which may include the business services, consumer (non-retail), energy, industrial, leisure and technology, media and telecommunications industries;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Performance Catalysts: We intend to solicit target companies that have clearly identifiable opportunities to execute on growth initiatives following the initial business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Market Fragmentation: We intend to seek business combinations that have significant opportunities for selective strategic acquisitions and partnerships that can complement an organic growth strategy; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefit from Being a Public Company: We intend to acquire a business that can benefit from being publicly-traded and can effectively utilize broader access to capital.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that we may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet some or any of the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 
Effecting a Business Combination
 
We will either (i) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (ii) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this report. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. Unlike other blank check companies which require stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We have until June 13, 2020 to consummate an initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable and up to $150,000 for any dissolution or liquidation related expenses, as applicable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law and as further described elsewhere in this report, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. We expect the pro rata redemption price to be approximately $10.00 per share of common stock, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However, we cannot assure you that we will in fact be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders.
 
Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of our board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board of directors is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.

We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We will also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Schultze Asset Management, investment funds or separate accounts advised by Schultze Asset Management or our sponsor or its officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Schultze Asset Management, investment funds or separate accounts advised by Schultze Asset Management or our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
We may, at our option, pursue a business combination opportunity jointly with one or more entities affiliated with Schultze Asset Management and/or one or more investors in funds or separate accounts managed by Schultze Asset Management, which we refer to as an “Affiliated Joint Acquisition.” Any such parties would co-invest only if (i) permitted by applicable regulatory and other legal limitations; (ii) we and Schultze Asset Management considered a transaction to be mutually beneficial to us as well as the affiliated entity; and (iii) other business reasons exist to do so, such as the strategic merits of including such co-investors, the need for additional capital beyond the amount held in our trust account to fund the initial business combination and/or the desire to obtain committed capital for closing the initial business combination. An Affiliated Joint Acquisition may be effected through a co-investment with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the initial business combination by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. The amount and other terms and conditions of any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are not obligated to make any specified future issuance and may determine not to do so. This is not an offer for any specified future issuance.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.

The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to pay a fee upon consummation of our initial business combination pursuant to the business combination marketing agreement;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Employees
 
We have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our units, common stock and warrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. These filings are available to the public via the Internet at the SEC’s website located at http://www.sec.gov. You may also read and copy any document that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s public reference room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. For more information, please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. You may request a copy of our filings with the SEC (excluding exhibits) at no cost by writing or telephoning us at the following address or telephone number:
Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp. 
 800 Westchester Avenue, Suite 632 
 Rye Brook, NY 10573 
 Tel: (914) 701-5260

We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
 
We may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
        We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our outstanding shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
