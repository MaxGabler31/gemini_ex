Item 1.      Business
Overview
RMI’s predecessor entity was incorporated in August 2012 as a Nevada corporation. We are an exploration stage company dedicated to operating industrial assets in the United States (U.S.) including minerals, materials and services. Our strategy is to become a key provider of industrial materials and services in the Rocky Mountain region. We utilize differentiated operational capabilities, which we believe will allow us to outperform conventional operators through diverse markets.
We have a strategy to own, operate, develop, acquire and vertically integrate complementary industrial businesses. The experienced management team of RMI has a multi-cycle track record of operating industrial resource businesses.
We operate the Mid-Continent Quarry in Garfield County, Colorado, producing chemical-grade calcium carbonate that currently services local and regional customers in a variety of end markets, including but not limited to mining, manufacturing, construction, and agriculture. The Mid-Continent Quarry, which is located outside the city of Glenwood Springs, consists of 44 unpatented mining claims owned by the Bureau of Land Management and controlled by RMI. The operation currently serves Arch Resources, local construction firms, and various city and county government construction projects. The quarry is currently undergoing an expansion and modernization effort. For the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, we produced and sold 26,356 and 16,232 tons of high-calcium limestone, respectively, from the Mid-Continent Quarry. Please reference “Cautionary Note Regarding Exploration Stage Status and Use of Certain Mining Terms” for disclosure concerning the current stage of our mineral explorations.
We are also actively developing Rocky Mountain Rail Park (the “Rail Park”), a dedicated rail-served industrial business park serving the greater Denver market. In February 2018, we acquired approximately 470 acres of land in Bennett, Colorado which serves as the foundation for the Rail Park. In July 2018, we exercised our option to acquire an additional approximately 150 acres for a total of approximately 620 acres. The Company’s development of the Rail Park is intended to expand the customer base for our products by utilizing rail freight capabilities to reach customers in the greater Denver area and by expanding our business to include rail transportation solutions and services. We intend to be the permanent owner and operator of the Rail Park and once operational, the facility will seek to establish a new industrial hub for rail transportation and related services serving Adams County, Colorado and the greater Denver metropolitan area. Purchaser interest has been strong after the unanimous approval by the Adams County Board of County Commissioners of the Final Development Plan and Final Plat in September 2020. Additionally, the Rail Park sold an 83 acre lot in January 2021, which has further positively impacted the interest in the property’s remaining southern lots. 
Rail freight capabilities will allow the Mid-Continent Quarry’s products to access the Denver market, where demand for calcium carbonate is currently strong and supply is relatively limited. The market opportunity is primarily centered on front range infrastructure demands, but also includes fertilizer, animal feed, and multiple other industrial applications. According to the USGS Natural Aggregates Statistics and information, Colorado demand for the first three quarters in 2021 for construction aggregate was approximately 39.0 million metric tons, comprised of 26.2 million metric tons of sand and gravel and 12.9 million metric tons of crushed stone. The area experiences supply shortages in peak seasons, creating a natural market for our products. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this market environment.
In addition to developing and expanding our existing assets, we expect to supplement our growth with strategic acquisitions of related business and the integration these businesses to achieve economies of scale and synergies. We target companies in various sectors directed towards industrial and/or infrastructure applications, including but not limited to construction materials, industrial minerals, industrial resources, logistics solutions, and transportation.

Industry and Competition
Limestone
Limestone, or calcium carbonate, is used in a variety of applications including coal mining, coal fired power plants, construction aggregates, glass bottle and steel manufacturing, and agriculture. Regional competitors include Pete Lien & Sons, Inc., and United States Lime & Minerals, Inc.
Construction Aggregates
Aggregates are key material components used in the production of cement, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt paving mixes for the residential, nonresidential and public infrastructure markets and are also widely used for various applications and products, such as road and building foundations, railroad ballast, erosion control, filtration, roofing granules and in solutions for snow and ice control. Generally extracted from the earth using surface or underground mining methods, aggregates are produced from natural deposits of various materials such as limestone, sand and gravel, granite and trap rock.
Markets are typically local due to high transport costs and are generally fragmented, with numerous participants operating in localized markets. After the uncertainty in 2020 due to the pandemic, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. market for aggregates production grew an estimated 4% year over year for crushed stone, sand and gravel in the third quarter of 2021. This outpaces historic norms. Aggregates consumption is more heavily weighted towards public infrastructure and maintenance repair. However, the mix of end uses can vary widely by geographic location, based on the nature of construction activity in each market. Typically, three to six competitors comprise the majority market share in each local market because of constraints around the availability of natural resources and transportation. Regional competitors for construction aggregates in Colorado include Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., Albert Frei & Sons, Inc., Aggregate Industries, Brannan Sand & Gravel Co., LLC, L.G. Everist, Inc., and BURNCO.
Environmental and Government Regulation
Our operations are and will be subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances in the United States and abroad relating to the protection of the environment and human health and to safety, including those pertaining to chemical manufacture and distribution, waste generation, storage and disposal, discharges to waterways, and air emissions and various other health and safety matters. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance 

2



with their regulations, and violators may be subject to civil, criminal and administrative penalties, injunctions or both. We will devote significant financial resources to ensure compliance. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all the applicable laws and regulations.
We anticipate that the regulation of our business operations under federal, state and local environmental laws in the United States and abroad will increase and become more stringent over time. We cannot estimate the impact of increased and more stringent regulation on our operations, future capital expenditure requirements or the cost of compliance.
United States Regulation. Statutory programs relating to protection of the environment and human health and to safety in the United States include, among others, the following.
CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, also known as “CERCLA” and “Superfund”, and comparable state laws generally impose joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of specified substances, including under CERCLA those designated as “hazardous substances.” These “potentially responsible parties” include the present and certain former owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and those that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the site. These liabilities can arise in association with the properties where operations were conducted, as well as disposal facilities where wastes were sent. Many states have adopted comparable or more stringent state statutes. In the course of our operations, we have generated materials that fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. We may also be the owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released and may have generated hazardous substances that have been transported to or otherwise released upon offsite facilities. We may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities at which such substances have been released by previous owners or operators and offsite facilities to which our wastes were transported and for associated damages to natural resources.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws regulate the treatment, storage, disposal, remediation and transportation of wastes, specifically under RCRA those designated as “hazardous wastes.” The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for these wastes and impose numerous regulations upon the treatment, storage, disposal, remediation and transportation of them. Our operations generate wastes that are subject to RCRA and comparable state statutes. Furthermore, wastes generated by our operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may be designated in the future as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes and, therefore, may be subject to more rigorous and costly treatment, storage and disposal requirements. Governmental agencies (and in the case of civil suits, private parties in certain circumstances) can bring actions for failure to comply with RCRA requirements, seeking administrative, civil, or criminal penalties and injunctive relief, to compel us to abate a solid or hazardous waste situation that presents an imminent or substantial endangerment to health or the environment.
Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including dredged and fill materials into waters of the United States. Under the Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws, the government (and in the case of civil suits, private parties in certain circumstances) can bring actions for failure to comply with Clean Water Act requirements and enforce compliance through civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of hazardous substances and of other pollutants. In the event of an unauthorized discharge of pollutants, we may be liable for penalties and subject to injunctive relief.
Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended and comparable state and local laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Governmental agencies (and in the case of civil suits, private parties in certain circumstances) can bring actions for failure to strictly comply with air pollution regulations or permits and generally enforce compliance through administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions, resulting in fines, injunctive relief (which could include requiring us to forego construction, modification or operation of sources of air pollutants) and 

3



imprisonment. While we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues, we do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Greenhouse Gas Regulation. More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gases (GHGs) may be adopted in the future and could cause us to incur material expenses in complying with them. The EPA has begun to regulate GHGs as pollutants under the CAA. The EPA adopted rules to permit GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permitting programs including the “Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule,” requiring that the largest sources first obtain permits for GHG emissions. The United States Supreme Court, however, ruled in 2014 that the EPA did not have the authority to require permits for GHG emissions and also did not have the authority to adopt that rule. The EPA may not treat GHGs as an air pollutant for purposes of determining whether a source is a major source that is required to obtain a Prevention of Significant Deterioration or Title V permit. The Court did hold that if a source required a permit under the program because of other pollutants, the EPA had the authority to require that the source demonstrate that it would use the best available control technology to minimize GHG emissions that exceeded a minimal amount.
Because of the lack of any comprehensive legislation program addressing GHGs, the EPA is using its existing regulatory authority to promulgate regulations requiring reduction in GHG emissions from various categories of sources, starting with fossil fuel-fired power plants. Specifically, in June 2019, the EPA issued the final Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which, among other things, establishes emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE rule replaces the Clean Power Plan that the EPA had issued in 2015. There is a great deal of uncertainty as to how and when additional federal regulation of GHGs might take place. Some members of Congress have expressed the intention to promote legislation to curb the EPA’s authority to regulate GHGs. In addition to federal regulation, a number of states, individually and regionally, and localities also are considering implementing or have implemented GHG regulatory programs. These regional and state initiatives may result in so–called cap–and–trade programs, under which overall GHG emissions are limited and GHG emission “allowances” are then allocated and sold to and between persons subject to the program. These and possibly other regulatory requirements could result in our incurring material expenses to comply, for example by being required to purchase or to surrender allowances for GHGs resulting from other operations or otherwise being required to control or reduce emissions.
Health and Safety. Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally regulations and requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”). The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA’s community right-to-know regulations and similar state programs may require us to organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. Failure to comply with requirements from these laws and regulations can result in sanctions such as fines and penalties and claims for personal injury and property damage. These requirements may also result in increased operating and capital costs in the future. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements to extent applicable.
Licenses, Permits and Product Registrations. Certain licenses, permits and product registrations are required for our products and operations in the United States. The licenses, permits and product registrations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by governmental authorities. In the United States in particular, producers and distributors of chemicals such as penta and creosote are subject to registration and notification requirements under federal law (including under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”) and the Toxic Substances Control Act, and comparable state law) in order to sell those products in the United States. Compliance with these laws has had, and in the future will continue to have, a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Under FIFRA, the law’s registration system requires an ongoing submission to the EPA of substantial scientific research and testing data regarding the chemistry and toxicology of pesticide products by manufacturers.
