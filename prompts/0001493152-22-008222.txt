Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing transformative technologies to improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare expenditures in the surgical and chronic wound and skin care markets. Our portfolio of products, services and technologies is anticipated to allow us to deliver comprehensive wound and skin care solutions for patients in all care settings, including acute (hospitals and long-term acute care hospitals (“LTACHs”)) and post-acute (wound care clinics, physician offices, skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”), home health, hospice, and retail). Each of our products, services, and technologies contribute to our overall goal of achieving better clinical outcomes at a lower overall cost for patients regardless of where they receive care. We strive to be one of the most innovative and comprehensive providers of effective wound and skin care solutions and are continually seeking to expand our offerings for patients requiring wound and skin care treatments across the entire continuum of care in the United States.
 
We currently market several products across surgical and chronic wound care applications and have multiple products in our pipeline. We currently license our products from Applied Nutritionals, LLC (“AN”) (through a sublicense with CGI Cellerate RX, LLC (“CGI Cellerate RX”), an affiliate of The Catalyst Group, Inc. (“Catalyst”)) and Rochal Industries, LLC (“Rochal”), and have the right to exclusively distribute certain products manufactured by Cook Biotech Inc. (“Cook Biotech”). We are also developing additional products in our own product pipeline.
 
In June 2020, we formed a subsidiary, United Wound and Skin Solutions LLC (“UWSS”, or “WounDerm”), to hold certain investments and operations in wound and skin care virtual consult services. We anticipate that these various service offerings will allow clinicians/physicians utilizing our technologies to collect and analyze large amounts of data on patient conditions and outcomes that will improve treatment protocols and ultimately lead to more evidence-based formulary to improve patient outcomes. Through a combination of our WounDerm services and our Sanara products, we believe we will be able to offer patient care solutions at every step in the continuum of wound and skin care, from diagnosis through healing.
 
Effective July 1, 2021, we acquired certain assets from Rochal, including, among others, intellectual property, four FDA 510(k) clearances, rights to license certain products and technologies currently under development, equipment and supplies. As a result of the asset purchase, our pipeline now contains product candidates for mitigation of opportunistic pathogens and biofilm, wound re-epithelialization and closure, necrotic tissue debridement and cell compatible substrates.
 
Market Scale
 
A study by a physician at the Department of Surgery for the Indiana University Health Comprehensive Wound Center found that approximately 8.2 million patients suffer from surgical and chronic wounds each year in the United States. Furthermore, according to an article published by the American College of Surgeons and Surgical Infection Society, in the United States, the annual treatment cost projections for all wounds is approximately $28 billion with the estimated annual cost of surgical site infections ranging from $3.5 billion to $10 billion. The U.S. teledermatology market alone is estimated to grow from $5 billion in 2019 to $45 billion by 2027 according to a research report by Fortune Business Insights. In addition to our surgical wound and chronic wound products, we are planning to fully launch virtual consult services through WounDerm for both virtual wound and virtual skin (dermatology) consultations.
Summary of our Product & Service Offerings and Development Programs
 
We are committed to developing and commercializing innovative products that address the challenges physicians face in diagnosing and treating wound and skin care ailments.
 
Our surgical wound care products, CellerateRX Surgical Activated Collagen (Powder and Gel) (collectively, “CellerateRX Surgical”), are used in a wide range of surgical specialties to help promote patient healing and reduce the risk of complications. The product is used in specialties including cardiothoracic, colorectal, general surgery, hand, head and neck, high-risk obstetrics and gynecology, Mohs surgery, neurosurgery, oncology, orthopedic (hip and knee, sports, spine, joint, foot and ankle, ortho trauma and ortho oncology), plastic/reconstructive, podiatric, urology, and vascular. Currently, substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of surgical wound care products. We anticipate that chronic wound care products and WounDerm technology-based services will become meaningful drivers of revenue in the future.

Our chronic wound care products, HYCOL Hydrolyzed Collagen (Powder and Gel) (collectively, “HYCOL”), BIAKŌS Skin and Wound Cleanser (“BIAKŌS AWC”) and BIAKŌS Skin and Wound Gel, are used across the post-acute continuum of care, including home health, hospice, physician offices, podiatrists, retail, SNFs, and wound care centers. Our chronic wound care products can be used on stage I-IV pressure ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers (“DFUs”), venous stasis, arterial, post-surgical wounds, first- and second-degree burns and donor sites. BIAKŌS AWC is also available in an irrigation bottle (BIAKŌS Antimicrobial Skin and Wound Irrigation Solution) that can be used in conjunction with negative pressure wound therapy installation and dwell (“NPWTi-d”) and other wound irrigation needs.

In addition, we expect to fully commercialize three products with Cook Biotech in 2022. The first two, FORTIFY TRG Tissue Repair Graft and FORTIFY FLOWABLE Extracellular Matrix, are currently 510(k) cleared for use in the surgical wound care segment, and VIM Amnion Matrix is categorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) as an HCT/P, subject to regulation under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) (for which no premarket approval or clearance is required).
 
In addition, we have a robust pipeline of products under development for the chronic wound care, surgical wound care, and virtual consult markets. We believe our pipeline efforts will deepen our comprehensive portfolio of offerings as well as allow us to address additional clinical applications. Wound care products in our pipeline include an antimicrobial skin protectant, a debrider product that leverages the body’s own enzymes and moisture, next generation CellerateRX and HYCOL, and a sterile BIAKŌS product for use in surgical settings.
 
The WounDerm technology-based services include an electronic medical record (“EMR”) software platform for both wound and skin conditions, skin and wound virtual consult services (through Direct Dermatology Inc. (“DirectDerm”) and MGroup Integrated Physician Services, P.A. (“MGroup”)), and diagnostic products and services for chronic wounds (through Precision Healing Inc. (“Precision Healing”)). Once WounDerm’s service offerings are fully integrated, we expect to be able to provide wound treatment solutions for patients across the entire acute and post-acute continuum of care.
 
Strategy
 

● | Drive additional market penetration as well as geographic expansion for our products. We intend to leverage our comprehensive product and technology-based services portfolio and relationships with key constituents to deepen our presence in the surgical and chronic wound and skin care markets. We believe the breadth and flexibility of the products we offer allow us to address a wide variety of wound types and sizes and offer significant new opportunities for sales growth. In addition, we believe that as we continue to offer new products and technology-based services, our salesforce’s ability to reach additional customers in new and existing geographic regions while penetrating further in existing customer accounts will be enhanced. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expand into new markets for our products and services. In 2020 and 2021, we made significant investments in virtual consult technologies and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically increased demand for these services with expanded reimbursements and patients being more comfortable seeing their care provider virtually. We believe that the virtual consult technologies and services that we will offer, when combined with our innovative and highly efficacious products, will offer a differentiated comprehensive wound and skin care solution for patients and care givers. 
● | Launch new innovative products. We are internally developing, and actively working with third-party research and development partners to develop additional proprietary products for the surgical and chronic wound and skin care markets. We expect these products and services to deepen our portfolio of technologies to treat chronic wounds as well as improve surgical site outcomes. We are focused on offering additional products and services that are more efficacious than competing products and services and provide a stronger value proposition (lower total cost to heal and less time to heal, leading to reduced costs to the healthcare system). 
● | Capture patients throughout the entire continuum of care. We intend to continue expanding our platform to aid in treating wound and skin care patients as they progress through the healing process in all care settings. As discussed above, in June 2020, we formed a subsidiary, UWSS, to hold certain investments in technologies and operations in wound and skin care virtual consult services. We believe our service offerings will allow us to collect and analyze large amounts of data on patient conditions and outcomes that will improve treatment protocols and ultimately lead to more evidence-based healing formularies to improve outcomes in the future. We anticipate that this data will also enable us to participate in the creation of new standards of care that promote patient compliance and enable direct dialogue between patients, clinicians and payors, resulting in greater satisfaction for patients, their caregivers, clinicians and payors. 
● | Seek and establish partnerships and product, technology, and/or services acquisitions. We plan to continue to seek and establish partnerships in the United States and internationally to provide innovative products, services, and technologies. We believe that partnerships will be a key driver of our growth in the future. We also intend to selectively pursue acquisitions of businesses and technologies that complement our existing strategy and footprint.

Competitive Strengths
 

● | Comprehensive solution for improved wound care outcomes. We are dedicated to offering a comprehensive portfolio of products and services to improve wound care treatment outcomes. We are currently developing the capability to provide telehealth services for the diagnosis and treatment of wound and skin care patients. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we conducted a pilot program with a large home health agency. The pilot program realized positive results and will expand to include the service offering to six more agencies in the first quarter of 2022. Our product offerings are able to disinfect wounds and accelerate the body’s healing process for acute and chronic wounds and allow clinicians to provide a consistent plan of care for a patient from diagnosis through treatment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Wound care products for all care settings. Our wound care product portfolio allows clinicians to personalize solutions to meet the needs of individual wound care patients in all care settings including acute (hospitals and LTACHs) and post-acute (wound care clinics, physician offices, SNFs, home health, hospice, and retail). 
● | Innovative pipeline and proven clinical performance. We have a robust pipeline of surgical and chronic wound and skin care products that we expect to market in the near term. We believe the efficacy of our offerings, will be proven via statistically significant collected and analyzed clinical and health economic outcomes data, resulting in expanded adoption of our products at a lower overall cost to payors. 
● | Attractive markets for acute and chronic wound care. We believe the acute and chronic wound care markets will continue to see accelerated growth given favorable global tailwinds that include an aging population, increasing costs of health care, recognition of difficult-to-treat infection threats such as biofilms, and the increasing prevalence of diabetes and obesity. We believe there will be growing adoption of our products due to their clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness for all key constituents compared to traditional wound care products. 
● | Proven executive leadership team with a long-term track record of value creation. We are led by a dedicated and seasoned management team with significant industry experience who have successfully executed our strategic implementation to date by launching new products and technologies through investment in new areas of growth. We believe our management has the vision and experience to implement our future growth strategy. 

 
Market Opportunities for our Products and Technology-Based Services
 
In October 2019, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (“CMS”) reimbursement methodology for home health agencies and SNFs (Patient Driven Group Model and Patient Driven Payment Model, respectively) created unique opportunities to provide efficacious wound healing inside of those sites of care in unprecedented fashion. With those payment models now focused on a patient’s characteristics (including number of wounds and skin conditions) rather than the volume of services provided, greater remuneration is provided to home health agencies and SNFs for the treatment of wound care patients. As a result, the incentive to transfer patients with both acute and chronic wounds to more burdensome and costly care settings, such as inpatient or outpatient wound-care centers, has been discouraged or, in some cases, eliminated. This shift in vertical economics provides us with a unique opportunity, in adjunctive fashion with home health agencies and SNFs, to deliver highly technical and comprehensive wound care where this most vulnerable patient population resides thus achieving CMS’s desired results: better patient outcomes at a lower total cost of care.

Chronic and Other Hard-to-Heal Wounds
 
According to a study published by the Value in Health journal, roughly 15% of the Medicare beneficiary population has chronic nonhealing wounds. Chronic wounds do not advance through the phases of healing in a normal progression and do not show significant progress toward healing in 30 days. Factors contributing to the chronicity of the wound may include pressure / friction, trauma; insufficient blood flow and oxygenation in locations such as the lower extremities; increased bacterial load; excessive proteases; degraded growth factors; matrix metalloproteinases (“MMPs”); senescent / aberrant cells; or inappropriate treatment. Examples of chronic wounds include DFUs, venous leg ulcers (“VLUs”), arterial ulcers, pressure ulcers and hard-to-heal surgical/traumatic wounds. In each of the various wound types, the presence of biofilms is a frequent cause for chronification of wounds and the removal of biofilms is a crucial step to commence healing. Biofilms need to be eradicated to prevent further deterioration of the wound that may result in additional negative patient outcomes. If not effectively treated, these wounds can lead to potentially severe complications, including further infection, osteomyelitis, fasciitis, amputation and increased mortality. Chronic wounds are primarily seen in the elderly population. For example, a 2019 study published in Advances in Wound Care reported that in the United States, 3% of the population over the age of 65 had open wounds. According to the same study, in 2020, the U.S. government estimated that the elderly population totaled 55 million people, suggesting that chronic wounds will continue to be an increasingly persistent problem in this population. Four common chronic and other hard-to-heal wounds are:
 

● | Diabetic Foot Ulcers. Diabetes can lead to a reduction in blood flow, which can cause patients to lose sensation in their feet and may prevent them from noticing injuries, sometimes leading to the development of DFUs, which are open sores or ulcers on the feet that may take several weeks to heal, if ever. According to the 2020 National Diabetes Statistics Report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in the United States alone, over 34 million people, or approximately 10% of the population, suffer from diabetes, a chronic, life-threatening disease. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Venous Leg Ulcers. VLUs develop as a result of vascular insufficiency, or the inability for the vasculature of the leg to return blood back toward the heart properly and, according to a 2013 report published by the International Journal of Tissue Repair and Regeneration, VLUs affect approximately 600,000 people per year in the United States alone. These ulcers usually form on the sides of the lower leg, above the ankle and below the calf, and are slow to heal and often recur if preventative steps are not taken. The risk of venous ulcers can be increased as a result of a blood clot forming in the deep veins of the legs, obesity, smoking, lack of physical activity or work that requires many hours of standing. 
● | Pressure Ulcers. Pressure ulcers, also known as decubitus ulcers or bed sores, are injuries to skin and underlying tissue resulting from prolonged pressure, or pressure in combination with shear or friction. Constant pressure on an area of skin reduces blood supply to the area and over time can cause the skin to break down and form an open ulcer. These often occur in patients who are hospitalized or confined to a chair or bed and most often form on the skin over bony areas, where there is little cushion between the bone and the skin, such as heels, ankles, hips and the tailbone. Annually, 2.5 million pressure ulcers are treated in the United States in acute care facilities alone, according to a 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
● | Surgical/traumatic wounds. Surgical wounds form as a result of various types of surgical procedures such as investigative or corrective, minor or major, open (traditional) or minimal access surgery, elective or emergency, and incisions (simple cuts) or excision (removal of tissue), among others. Traumatic wounds form as a result of cuts, lacerations or puncture wounds, which have caused damage to the skin and underlying tissue. Severe traumatic wounds may require surgical intervention to close the wound and stabilize the patient. Surgical/traumatic hard-to-heal wounds develop for various reasons, such as local surgical complications, suboptimal closure techniques, presence of foreign materials, exposed bones or tendons and infection. In the United States, millions of people receive post-surgical wound care annually, and the typical operative patient has comorbidities that create challenges with post-operative wound healing. 

Sanara Products
 
We market, develop and distribute wound and skin care products and services to physicians, hospitals, clinics, and post-acute care settings. Our products are primarily sold in the U.S. surgical tissue repair and advanced wound care markets. We are actively seeking to expand within our six focus areas of wound and skin care for the surgical, acute, and post-acute markets: (1) debridement, (2) biofilm removal, (3) hydrolyzed collagen, (4) advanced biologics, (5) negative pressure wound therapy products and (6) the oxygen delivery system segment of the wound and skin care market.

CellerateRX Surgical is a medical hydrolysate of Type I bovine collagen indicated for the management of surgical, traumatic, and partial- and full-thickness wounds as well as first- and second-degree burns. It is manufactured in what we believe to be a trade secret process and the powder is further processed for use in a sterile, surgical environment. The gel is typically applied post-operatively. CellerateRX Surgical products are primarily purchased by hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers for use by surgeons on surgical wounds. The predominance of CellerateRX Surgical is used in foot and ankle, neuro/spinal, orthopedic/hip and knee replacement, ortho trauma, and ortho oncology surgeries. Additional specialties benefiting from the use of CellerateRX Surgical include cardiothoracic, colorectal, general, general trauma, gynecologic oncology, hand, head and neck, Mohs, obstetrics and gynecology (including caesarean deliveries), plastic/reconstructive, urologic, and vascular.
 
CellerateRX Surgical is used in operative cases where patients might have trouble healing normally due to underlying health complications. There is always a risk of complication with surgical incisions. This is especially true in patients with certain comorbidities, including obesity, diabetes and hypertension. These complications can include surgical site infections, dehiscence (where an incision opens after primary closure) and necrosis. Surgeons use CellerateRX Surgical to complement the body’s normal healing process. By helping the body heal normally without complications, improved patient outcomes are achieved, thereby reducing downstream costs related to complications (such as re-operation, longer hospitalization, re-admittance, extended rehabilitative care and other additional treatments). Wound infections have become increasingly problematic due to the high rates of surgical patient comorbidities and the financial strain on insurance carriers as well as hospitals who suffer exorbitant costs for readmission of these patients within 30 days of surgery.
 
In a prospective study published by SciMedCentral in 2017, of 102 consecutive neurosurgery cases in which a mixture of 5 grams of CellerateRX Surgical powder and 1 gram Vancomycin powder was applied at closure, there were no cases of wound dehiscence, infection, complication or allergic reaction to the product. This compares to neurosurgery infection rates ranging from as high as 24% for cranioplasty surgery to 6.3% for spine surgery patients. Two similar retrospective studies are underway using CellerateRX powder in ortho/spine surgeries and general/colorectal surgeries.
 
In a retrospective study published by SciMed Central in November 2021, a retrospective review was conducted of 154 patients who underwent spinal surgery using CellerateRX® Surgical powder. A total of three (representing 1.9%) high-risk patients developed postoperative wound complications (SSI or dehiscence). All complications resolved with local wound care and oral antibiotics; no hospital readmissions were required. This low incidence of surgical complications further supports the use of type 1 hydrolyzed collagen as an effective wound therapy agent in spinal surgery.
 
HYCOL Hydrolyzed Collagen products are a medical hydrolysate of Type I bovine collagen intended for the management of full and partial thickness wounds including pressure ulcers, venous and arterial leg ulcers and DFUs. HYCOL is primarily used in SNFs, wound care centers and physician offices and is currently approved for reimbursement under Medicare Part B. HYCOL provides the benefit of hydrolyzed collagen fragments directly in the wound bed. Therefore, unlike with the body’s own native collagen or native collagen products, the body does not have to break HYCOL down before use, which is extremely beneficial when treating elderly and otherwise compromised patients with comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
 
We believe our CellerateRX and HYCOL products are unique in composition, superior to other products in clinical performance, demonstrate the ability to reduce costs associated with the standards of care for their intended uses and have been safely used on over seventy-five thousand patients.
 
BIAKŌS AWC is an FDA 510(k) cleared, patented product that laboratory tests show effectively disrupts extracellular polymeric substances to eradicate mature biofilm microbes. BIAKŌS AWC is indicated for the mechanical removal of debris, dirt, foreign materials, and microorganisms from wounds including stage I-IV pressure ulcers, DFUs, post-surgical wounds, first and second-degree burns as well as grafted and donor sites. BIAKŌS AWC is effective in killing free-floating microbes, immature, and mature bacterial biofilms and fungal biofilms within the product. In addition, safety studies demonstrated that BIAKŌS AWC is biocompatible and supports the wound healing process. Initial sales of BIAKŌS AWC occurred in July 2019.

BIAKŌS AWC is also available in an irrigation bottle (BIAKŌS Antimicrobial Skin and Wound Irrigation Solution) that can be used in conjunction with NPWTi-d and other wound irrigation needs.
 
BIAKŌS Antimicrobial Wound Gel is an antimicrobial hydrogel wound dressing that can be used alone or in combination with BIAKŌS AWC. In February 2020, we received notification of FDA 510(k) clearance for BIAKŌS Antimicrobial Wound Gel and launched the product in November 2020 to complement BIAKŌS AWC.
 
BIAKŌS AWC and BIAKŌS Antimicrobial Wound Gel are effective against planktonic microbes as well as immature and mature biofilms within the product. When used together, the cleanser can be used initially to clean a wound and disrupt biofilms (removing 99% in 10 minutes). The gel can then be applied and remains in the wound for up to 72 hours helping to continue disrupting biofilm microbes. In a study conducted in 2020, BIAKŌS Antimicrobial Wound Gel, in combination with BIAKŌS AWC, was compared to a number of wound cleansers to treat chronic wounds such as pressure, diabetic, and venous ulcers in the inflammatory phase of wound healing. The BIAKŌS system reduced the biofilm burden by 7.5 logs (>99.99% reduction) by the 24-hour time point and eradicated it by the 48-hour time point while the remaining commercial controls reduced the Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”) biofilms by less than 1 log.
 
FORTIFY TRG Tissue Repair Graft is a freeze-dried, multi-layer small intestinal submucosa (SIS) extracellular matrix (ECM) sheet. The graft is used for implantation to reinforce soft tissue, has a thin profile, is available in multiple sizes, and can be cut to size to accommodate the patient’s anatomy. FORTIFY TRG Tissue Repair Graft is provided sterile and can be hydrated with autologous blood fluid. It is an FDA 510(k) cleared product and terminally sterilized. First sales of this product occurred in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 
FORTIFY FLOWABLE Extracellular Matrix is an advanced wound care device that presents the SIS ECM technology in a way that can fill irregular wound shapes and depths. FORTIFY FLOWABLE Extracellular Matrix is indicated for the management of wounds including: partial and full-thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, chronic vascular ulcers, tunneled/undermined wounds, surgical wounds (donor sites/grafts, post-Mohs surgery, post-laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence), trauma wounds (abrasions, lacerations, second-degree burns, and skin tears) and draining wounds. FORTIFY FLOWABLE Extracellular Matrix is provided sterile and is intended for one-time use. It is a 510(k) cleared product. We began selling this product in early 2022.
 
VIM Amnion Matrix is a single layer sheet of amnion tissue that is minimally processed to decellularize the material while maintaining the structure and components of the extracellular matrix environment. All tissues are collected from consenting donors, tested for infectious diseases, and determined eligible for transplantation by a licensed Medical Director. It is provided in multiple sizes and terminally sterilized. The VIM Amnion Matrix is intended for homologous use as a wound covering or barrier in surgical, orthopedic, ophthalmic, and wound applications. It is air-dried for off-the-shelf room temperature storage with no product preparation. The graft is supplied sterile and is intended for one-time use in a single patient. We expect to begin selling the VIM product in 2022.
 
Beginning in early 2022, we began co-promoting the following products with Scendia Biologics, LLC: (i) TEXAGEN Amniotic Membrane Allograft, a multi-layer amniotic membrane allograft used as an anatomical barrier with robust handling that can be sutured if needed, (ii) BiFORM Bioactive Moldable Matrix, an osteoconductive, bioactive, porous implant that allows for bony ingrowth across the graft site, (iii) AMPLIFY Verified Inductive Bone Matrix, a 100% human allograft bone with conformable handling properties, and (iv) ALLOCYTE Advanced Cellular Bone Matrix, a human allograft cellular bone matrix (CBM) containing bone-derived progenitor cells and conformable bone fibers.


Sanara Technology-Based Services
 
We are currently developing the capability to offer various services addressing chronic wound and skin care through our subsidiary WounDerm, which has exclusive affiliations with three companies, which include DirectDerm, MGroup, and Precision Healing.
 
We anticipate that our various service offerings will allow us to collect large amounts of data on patient conditions and outcomes that will improve treatment protocols and ultimately lead to more evidence-based treatments to improve outcomes in the future. We believe our planned service offerings through WounDerm are complemented by our existing product portfolio to complete the comprehensive wound strategy.

WounDerm plans to offer the following services:
 

● | EMR software platform for both wound and skin conditions 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In 2020, we made a minority investment in Woundyne Medical, LLC (“Woundyne”) to fund further development of Woundyne’s imagery and data sharing platform designed to meet our specified virtual environment. In January 2021, we acquired the remaining interest of Woundyne. In June 2021, we invested in Canada-based Pixalere Healthcare, Inc. (“Pixalere”). In connection with this investment, Pixalere granted Pixalere Healthcare USA, LLC (“Pixalere USA”), our subsidiary, a royalty-free exclusive license to use the Pixalere software and platform in the United States. Pixalere provides a cloud-based wound care software tool that empowers nurses, specialists and administrators to deliver better care for patients. Pixalere developed a software system that combines the documentation functionality of wound care and dermatology EMRs with a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”)-secure online mobile application platform for provider and caregiver collaboration and the ability to perform virtual consultations via telemedicine. The software includes a complete wound and skin care specialty specific collaboration platform that allows for interoperability with client facing EMRs, reduce the burden of duplicate documentation, and improve the accuracy of assessments and treatment plans. We expect to have the EMR platform commercially available in mid-2022. Additionally, the collaboration platform is expected to integrate with the Precision Healing diagnostic imaging technology to gather images and clinical information. We anticipate that the proprietary software will provide for the correction of inaccurate initial measurements performed by caregivers, as well as adjustments for light and photo quality. We plan to have the Precision Healing technology integration complete and commercially available within our EMR platform in 2023.



● | Virtual consultation services for both wound and skin care conditions 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
DirectDerm is a telemedicine company based in Palo Alto, California and has an exclusive network of dermatologists licensed across 32 states who have trained and/or teach at top U.S. medical institutions, and whose service is covered by many of the major health plans in the United States. WounDerm is working to integrate the DirectDerm platform into its collaboration platform to provide virtual consultations through DirectDerm’s network of board-certified dermatologists to patients in all of WounDerm’s healthcare markets.
 
MGroup is a physician-owned and physician-led multispecialty wound care group focused on utilizing telehealth and associated technologies to build high-quality, cost-effective care delivery systems. MGroup currently holds active medical licenses in all 50 states. Our affiliation with MGroup will provide us with the ability to offer wound care telehealth services.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2021, we conducted a pilot program with a large home health agency. The pilot program realized positive results and will expand to include the service offering to six more agencies in the first quarter of 2022.



● | Diagnostic products and services for chronic wounds 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Precision Healing product platform is a diagnostic imaging and smart pad for assessing a patient’s wound and skin conditions. This comprehensive skin and wound assessment technology is designed to quantify biochemical markers to determine the trajectory of a wound’s condition to enable better diagnosis and treatment protocol. Precision Healing was formed by executives and imaging specialists at Lumicell Corporation as well as experienced wound care scientists and physicians. Precision Healing expects to have its imaging device and smart pad commercially available in 2023 and is currently being integrated into the WounDerm EMR.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed thirty regional sales managers (“RSMs”). Our RSMs are recruited based on their previous industry experience and professional performance and are required to have a minimum of three years of experience successfully selling into similar markets. We constantly evaluate new markets and sales opportunities to add to our sales teams as warranted.
 
RSMs are initially trained through an internal learning management system, SanaraU, which gives them further product and surgical specialty training including wound etiology, operating room etiquette and credentialing requirements. After completing their internal training, new hire RSMs participate in field training with experienced RSM field trainers to get insights into best practice as well as real world training. The initial training period lasts approximately five weeks. RSMs are supported by regular updated training modules on product information and best practices.
 
A key component of our sales and marketing efforts involves working with physicians and clinicians to champion our products in their facilities. We work closely with surgeons and health system stakeholders to demonstrate the efficacy and beneficial impact of our surgical products and successfully navigate the hospital value analysis committee, (more commonly known as the “VAC”), approval process, allowing our products to be sold in those facilities. Similarly, we work with clinicians to demonstrate the efficacy of our wound care products in their respective care settings. If our sales and marketing efforts are successful, the clinicians then advocate for the use of our products when medically necessary.

Manufacturing, Supply, and Production
 
We do not own or operate and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We rely on, and plan to continue relying on, contract manufacturing for our products. Our contract manufacturing strategy is intended to drive cost leverage and scale and avoid the high capital outlays and fixed costs associated with constructing and operating manufacturing facilities. Our manufacturing partners have internal compliance processes to maintain the high quality and reliability of our products. We believe our contract manufacturers are well-positioned to support future expansion of our product sales. We do source some packaging and marketing materials separate from our licensing partners.
Reimbursement, Clinical Validation, and Clinical Utility
 
We do not promote our products based on their reimbursement status, however we are mindful of the benefits of a favorable reimbursement coverage status to increase patient access and support our research and development efforts to supply the highest efficacy solutions.
 
Three of our chronic wound care products (BIAKŌS Antimicrobial Skin and Wound Gel, HYCOL Hydrolyzed Collagen Powder, and HYCOL Hydrolyzed Collagen Gel) have HCPCS A codes and are eligible for reimbursement through Medicare Part B. There is currently no reimbursement for BIAKŌS AWC, BIAKŌS Antimicrobial Skin and Wound Irrigation Solution, or CellerateRX Surgical.
 
We anticipate that our WounDerm services, once launched, will provide a wealth of patient data to help us measure our products’ effectiveness on improving patient outcomes while simultaneously reducing healthcare costs. We believe our reimbursement strategy, including establishing the clinical validation, clinical utility and health economics of our products, will allow us to drive improved reimbursement coverage for our products and technologies.
 
Competition
 
The wound care market is served by several large, multi-product line companies as well as a number of small companies. Our products compete with primary dressings, advanced wound care products, collagen matrices and other biopharmaceutical products. Manufacturers and distributors of competitive products include Smith & Nephew plc, Medline Industries, Inc., ConvaTec Group plc, Mölnlycke Health Care AB, 3M Company, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (which acquired ACell Inc. on January 20, 2021) and numerous others. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater financial and personnel resources. We believe, however, that our products outperform our competitors’ currently available equivalent products for the specific application in which they are intended by providing improved efficacy, better outcomes, and reduced cost of patient care.
 
WounDerm plans to offer a comprehensive wound care and dermatology strategy to expand cost-effective, high quality wound and skin care to all patients throughout the care setting continuum. Although novel in its comprehensive offerings and solutions, there are existing competitors for each of the verticals in which WounDerm plans to offer services and solutions.
 
Existing wound care imaging technology competitors include MolecuLight, Wound-Vision, HyperMed Imaging, Inc., SpectralMD, Inc., Kent and Tissue Analytics. However, we do not believe that any of these existing platforms offer a bioassay evaluation in combination with their imaging solution. In addition, there are existing wound care-specific EMR documentation and telemedicine communication platforms such as NetHealth, Swift Medical Inc., Corstrata, LLC and Intellicure, Inc.
 
The public health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the widespread adoption of telemedicine for all health care clinical specialties, including wound care and dermatology. As such, any clinical wound care or dermatology physician and/or provider group that has incorporated telemedicine into their practice could be considered competitive. However, the majority of these groups are local or regional and do not incorporate the comprehensive national care delivery platform that WounDerm expects to offer. Examples of large wound care specialty practices include Vohra Physician Group, Healogics Specialty Physicians and WoundTech.

Cook Biotech Marketing and Distribution Agreement
 
On December 17, 2020, we entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with Cook Biotech whereby we were appointed as the exclusive distributor in the United States of three Cook advanced biologic products. The first two products, FORTIFY TRG Tissue Repair Graft and FORTIFY FLOWABLE Extracellular Matrix, are for use in the surgical wound care segment, and VIM Amnion Matrix is for use in the chronic wound care and surgical wound care segments. We expect to fully commercialize these products in 2022.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, we will purchase the products from Cook Biotech at initial transfer prices stipulated in the agreement. Cook Biotech may update the transfer prices annually based on changes in the US Producer’s Price Index. Minimum annual order quantities will be agreed upon by both parties after the first year of the contract term. The agreement will terminate on the third anniversary of the date on which the first commercial sale to us from Cook Biotech is made, with automatic two-year renewal terms unless notice of non-renewal is given by one party at least one year prior to the end of the initial term or renewal term that is then in effect.
 
Resorbable Bone Hemostat
 
We acquired a patent in 2009 for a resorbable bone hemostat and delivery system for orthopedic bone void fillers. This patent is not part of our long-term strategic focus. We subsequently licensed the patent to a third party to market a bone void filler product for which we receive a 3% royalty on product sales over the life of the patent, which expires in 2023, with annual minimum royalties of $201,000. We pay two unrelated third parties a combined royalty equal to eight percent (8%) of our net revenues and royalties generated from products that utilize the acquired patented bone hemostat and delivery system. To date, royalties received by us related to this licensing agreement have not exceeded the annual minimum of $201,000 ($50,250 per quarter). Therefore, our annual royalty obligation under the terms of the license agreement has been $16,080 ($4,020 per quarter).
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to comprehensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we or our research and development partners or affiliates do business. The laws and regulations governing our business and interpretations of those laws and regulations and are subject to frequent change. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our research and development partners and affiliates, to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The laws and regulations relating to medical products and healthcare services that apply to our business and that of our partners and affiliates continue to evolve, and we must, therefore, devote significant resources to monitoring developments in legislation, enforcement, and regulation in such areas. As the applicable laws and regulations change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. We cannot provide assurance that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations.
 
FDA Regulation
 
Our medical products and operations are regulated by the FDA and other federal and state agencies. The products we currently market are regulated as medical devices in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, import, export, and market surveillance of our medical devices.
 
In addition, we have entered into agreements to market and distribute products regulated by FDA under Section 361 of the PHSA (42 U.S.C. § 264) and 21 C.F.R. Part 1271. These products include: (i) VIM Amnion Matrix, a tissue based product for use in the chronic wound care and surgical wound care segments, (ii) TEXAGEN Amniotic Membrane Allograft, a multi-layer amniotic membrane allograft used as an anatomical barrier with robust handling that can be sutured if needed, (iii) AMPLIFY Verified Inductive Bone Matrix, a 100% human allograft bone with conformable handling properties, and (iv) ALLOCYTE Advanced Cellular Bone Matrix, a human allograft cellular bone matrix (CBM) containing bone-derived progenitor cells and conformable bone fibers.

Device Premarket Regulatory Requirements
 
Before being introduced into the U.S. market, each medical device must obtain marketing clearance or approval from FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process, the de novo classification process (summarized below under De Novo Classification Process), or the premarket approval application (“PMA”) process, unless they are determined to be Class I devices or to otherwise qualify for an exemption from one of these available forms of premarket review and authorization by the FDA. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Classification of a device is important because the class to which a device is assigned determines, among other things, the necessity and type of FDA review required prior to marketing the device. Class I devices are those for which reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to general controls that include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), as well as regulations requiring facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. The Class I designation also applies to devices for which there is insufficient information to determine that general controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device or to establish special controls to provide such assurance, but that are not life-supporting or life-sustaining or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, and that do not present a potential unreasonable risk of illness of injury.
 
Class II devices are those for which general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and there is sufficient information to establish “special controls.” These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance requirements, patient registries and FDA guidance documents describing device-specific special controls. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, most Class II devices require a 510(k) premarket notification prior to commercialization in the United States; however, the FDA has the authority to exempt Class II devices from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement under certain circumstances. As a result, manufacturers of most Class II devices must submit 510(k) premarket notifications to the FDA under Section 510(k) of the FDCA (21 U.S.C. § 360(k)) in order to obtain the necessary clearance to market or commercially distribute such devices. To obtain 510(k) clearance, manufacturers must submit to the FDA adequate information demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to PMA, meaning, (i) a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (“preamendments device”) and for which a PMA is not required, (ii) a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or (iii) a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If there is no adequate predicate to which the manufacturer can compare its proposed device, the proposed device is automatically classified as a Class III device. In such cases, the device manufacturer must then fulfill the more rigorous PMA requirements or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification process.
 
The de novo classification process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its device to Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (“FDASIA”), the FDA is required to classify a device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo classification request. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the classification request must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the classification request if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
 
Devices that are intended to be life sustaining or life supporting, devices that are implantable, devices that present a potential unreasonable risk of harm or are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of health, and devices that are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device are placed in Class III and generally require FDA approval through the PMA process, unless the device is a preamendments device not yet subject to a regulation requiring premarket approval. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. For a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate through extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and clinical trials, that the device is safe and effective. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. Before approving a PMA, the FDA generally also performs an on-site inspection of manufacturing facilities for the product to ensure compliance with the QSR.

Thus far, all of the medical devices that we currently market and distribute have been cleared through 510(k) premarket notifications filed by our third-party research and development partners, who are the manufacturers of such devices. We also are continuing to work through the development process for a number of products in our pipeline. Our debrider product, as well a novel dressing that delivers oxygen to the wound bed and a sterile BIAKŌS product, are currently under development, and we are in discussions concerning the best path for seeking clearance and approval for these products. We are also exploring new indications of use and improved formulas for a next generation CellerateRX and a next generation HYCOL.
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support PMAs and are sometimes required to support 510(k) submissions. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”), regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, the agency requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA denies the application or notifies the company that the investigation is on hold and may not begin until the sponsor provides supplemental information about the investigation that satisfies FDA’s concerns. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE that require modification of the study, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an institutional review board (“IRB”), for each clinical site. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient according to criteria established by FDA as part of the IDE regulations, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate authorization from the FDA, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements.
 
Device Post-market Regulatory Requirements
 
After a device is cleared or approved for commercialization, and prior to marketing, numerous regulatory requirements apply to the various entities responsible for preparing a device for distribution, including the manufacturer (including specification developer), contract manufacturers, relabelers/repackagers, sterilizers and initial importer, as applicable. These include:

● | establishment registration and device listing; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | development of a quality management system, including establishing and implementing procedures to design and manufacture devices in compliance with the QSR (unless a device category is exempt from this requirement by the FDA, such as in the case of many Class I devices); 
● | labeling regulations that prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved uses (known as off-label uses), as well as requirements to provide accurate and non-misleading information and adequate information on both risks and benefits of the device; 
● | FDA’s unique device identification requirements that call for a unique device identifier (“UDI”) on device labels, packages, and in some cases, on the device itself, and submission of data to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (“GUDID”); 
● | medical device reporting regulations that require manufacturers to report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; 
● | corrections and removal reporting regulations that require manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and 
● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply to Class II or III devices if the FDA has issued a post-market surveillance order and the failure of the device would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences, the device is expected to have significant use in the pediatric population, the device is intended to be implanted in the human body for more than one year, or the device is intended to be used to support or sustain life and to be used outside a user facility.

Our research and development partners and their contract manufacturers may be subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. If we are required to register with the FDA, by becoming the manufacturer or specification developer of any medical device for instance, then we also may be subject to such inspections by FDA. If the FDA believes we or any of our research and development partners or their contract manufacturers are not in compliance with the QSR, or other post-market requirements, it has broad authority to take significant enforcement actions to compel compliance. Specifically, if the FDA determines that we or our research and development partners or their contract manufacturers failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the agency can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
 

● | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | customer notifications or repair, replacement or refunds; 
● | mandatory recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; 
● | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
● | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or approval of pre-market approval applications relating to new products or modified products; 
● | reclassifying a 510(k)-cleared device or withdrawing PMA approval; 
● | refusal to grant export approvals for our products; or 
● | pursuing criminal prosecution. 

 
Any such enforcement action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, these regulatory controls, as well as any changes in FDA policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction, and continued availability of new products.
 
HCT/P Regulatory Requirements
 
Human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”) are regulated by FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) or Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”) depending on the type of product, how it is manufactured and its intended uses. HCT/Ps that meet all of the criteria described in 21 C.F.R. § 1271.10(a) are regulated by CBER under Section 361 of the PHSA (42 U.S.C. § 264) and 21 C.F.R. Part 1271 only (“361 products”). Although 361 products do not require premarket review by FDA prior to commercialization, manufacturers of 361 products must register with FDA, submit a list of HCT/Ps manufactured, and comply with current good tissue practices (“cGTP”), among other things.
 
We have entered into an agreement to market and distribute VIM Amnion Matrix, which is manufactured from amniotic membrane and will be marketed as a 361 product. Cook Biotech, as the manufacturer, must comply with all requirements of Section 361 of the PHSA and 21 C.F.R. Part 1271 that are applicable to the products and may be subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA to ensure compliance with cGTP.
 
Federal Trade Commission Regulatory Oversight
 
Our advertising for our products and services is subject to federal truth-in-advertising laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, as well as comparable state consumer protection laws. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. The FTC has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by the substantive requirements of the FTC Act and other consumer protection laws can result in administrative or judicial penalties, including civil penalties, injunctions affecting the manner in which we would be able to market services or products in the future, or criminal prosecution.

Fraud and Abuse and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 
Our business activities (and the business activities of our research and development partners and affiliates), including, but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution and medical education, are subject to regulation by numerous federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States, including the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, CMS, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations, which are described below.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, furnishing, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, in whole or in part. The term “remuneration” has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. There are certain statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, of 2010, as amended (the “ACA”), modified the intent requirement under the Anti-Kickback Statute to a stricter standard, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA also provided that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is grounds for the government or a whistleblower to assert that a claim for payment of items or services resulting from such violation constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (the “FCA”). The ACA further created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members.
 
The federal civil FCA, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil FCA has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, or submission of inaccurate information required by government contracts, improper use of Medicare provider or supplier numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug’s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the products supplied or services rendered. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have further been sued under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil FCA; however, a change in Department of Justice policy now prohibits enforcement actions for knowing violations of law based on non-compliance with agency subregulatory guidance. Civil FCA actions may be brought by the government or may be brought by private individuals on behalf of the government, called “qui tam” actions. If the government decides to intervene in a qui tam action and prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in the proceeds from any fines or settlement funds. If the government declines to intervene, the individual may pursue the case alone. Since 2004, these FCA lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements, as much as $3.0 billion, regarding certain sales practices and promoting off label drug uses. Civil FCA liability may be imposed for Medicare or Medicaid overpayments, for example, overpayments caused by understated rebate amounts, that are not refunded within 60 days of discovering the overpayment, even if the overpayment was not caused by a false or fraudulent act.
 
The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the criminal FCA. The criminal FCA prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the civil FCA, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. The civil monetary penalties statute is another potential statute under which drug and device companies may be subject to enforcement. Among other things, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

HIPAA also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters. The ACA, as amended, modified the intent requirement under the certain portions of these federal criminal statutes such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.
 
The ACA further created federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered therapeutics, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members.
 
Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and some have transparency laws that require reporting price increases and related information. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers’ use of prescriber-identifiable data. Certain states also require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments or the provision of other items of value that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; impose restrictions on marketing practices; or require drug manufacturers to track and report information related to payments, gifts, and other items of value to physicians and other healthcare providers. These laws may affect our future sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties or other enforcement actions, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, debarment from receiving government contracts or refusal of new orders under existing contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 
Telemedicine Standards, and Related Laws and Guidelines
 
We have entered into a management agreement with MGroup, which is a physician-owned multispecialty wound care group with active medical licenses in all 50 states. Through this partnership, we expect to make available coordinated telemedicine services on our platform. In connection with this arrangement, we expect to administer non-clinical services to support the delivery of telemedicine services, including billing, scheduling and a wide range of other administrative and support services, and will be paid a pre-determined, fair market value amount for those services. We have also entered into a professional services agreement with and made a minority investment in DirectDerm, a dermatology telemedicine company based in California, which has an exclusive network of dermatologists licensed across 32 states.
 
The delivery of telemedicine services directly or through contractual relationships is subject to various federal, state, and local laws, regulations and approvals, relating to, among other things, the health provider licensure, adequacy and continuity of medical care, medical practice standards (including specific requirements when providing healthcare utilizing telemedicine technologies and consulting services among providers), medical records maintenance, personnel supervision, and prerequisites for the prescription of medication. The application of some of these laws to telemedicine is unclear and subject to differing interpretation. Further, laws and regulations specific to delivering medical services utilizing telemedicine technologies continues to evolve with some states incorporating modality and consent requirements for certain telemedicine encounters.
 
Telemedicine services also implicate state corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting laws which vary from state to state and are not always consistent among states. In addition, these requirements are subject to broad powers of interpretation, enforcement discretion by state regulators, and, in some cases, dated (yet still valid) case law. Some of these requirements may apply to us or our partners, even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on the engagement of a provider licensed in the state or the provision of telemedicine to a resident of the state. However, regulatory authorities or other parties, including providers in our affiliated provider network, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee-splitting. In this event, failure to comply could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our providers, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, or the need to make changes to the arrangements with our affiliated provider network; each of which could interfere with our business or prompt other materially adverse consequences.

U.S. Federal and State Health Information Privacy and Security Laws
 
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personally identifiable information (“PII”), including health information. In particular, HIPAA as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and its respective implementing regulations establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of PHI, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Our affiliated network providers and our hospital, health system and other provider clients are all regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. Since the effective date of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule on September 23, 2013, HIPAA’s requirements are also directly applicable to the independent contractors, agents and other “business associates” of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information (“PHI”) in connection with providing services to covered entities. We are a business associate under HIPAA when we are working on behalf of our affiliated providers.
 
Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. The civil penalties range from $119 to $59,522 per violation, with a cap of $1.8 million per year for violations of the same standard during the same calendar year. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. We must also comply with HIPAA’s breach notification rule. Under the breach notification rule, covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which may compromise the privacy, security or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. The regulations also require business associates of covered entities to notify the covered entity of breaches by the business associate.
 
State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. In light of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts.
 
HIPAA also required HHS to adopt national standards establishing electronic transaction standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically.
 
Many states in which we or our research and development partners may operate also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California are more restrictive than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws to which we are subject, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but also some, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject.
 
In addition to HIPAA, state health information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security and laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting.
 
In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of PII and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. In addition, under HIPAA and pursuant to the related contracts that we enter into with our business associates, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to our contractual partners following discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities and others.
