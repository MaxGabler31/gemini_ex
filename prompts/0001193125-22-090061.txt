ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General 
 Harbor Diversified, Inc. (“Harbor”) is a non-operating holding company that is the parent of a consolidated group of subsidiaries, including AWAC Aviation, Inc. (“AWAC”), which is the sole member of Air Wisconsin Airlines LLC (“Air Wisconsin”), a regional air carrier. Harbor is also the direct parent of three other subsidiaries: (1) Lotus Aviation Leasing, LLC (“Lotus”), which leases flight equipment to Air Wisconsin, (2) Air Wisconsin Funding LLC (“AWF”), which provides flight equipment financing to Air Wisconsin, and (3) Harbor Therapeutics, Inc. (“Therapeutics”), which is a non-operating entity with no material assets. Because Harbor consolidates Air Wisconsin for financial statement purposes, for purposes of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (this “Annual Report”), disclosures relating to activities of Air Wisconsin also apply to Harbor, unless otherwise noted. When appropriate, Air Wisconsin is named specifically for its individual contractual obligations, operations and related disclosures. Where reference is intended to include Harbor and its consolidated subsidiaries, they may be jointly referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our.” Where reference is intended to refer only to Harbor, it is referred to as the “Company.” 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, Air Wisconsin operated a fleet of 64 CRJ-200 regional jets under a capacity purchase agreement (the “United capacity purchase agreement”) with its sole major airline partner, United Airlines, Inc. (“United”), with a presence at both Chicago O’Hare and Washington-Dulles, two of United’s key domestic hubs. All of Air Wisconsin’s flights are operated as United Express pursuant to the terms of the United capacity purchase agreement. More than 99% of our operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was derived from operations associated with the United capacity purchase agreement. 
 Subject to certain limited exceptions, the United capacity purchase agreement provides Air Wisconsin fixed daily revenue for each aircraft covered under the agreement, a fixed payment for each departure and block hour flown, and reimbursement of certain direct operating expenses in exchange for providing regional flying service for United. The agreement also provides for the payment or accrual of certain amounts by United to Air Wisconsin based on certain scheduling benchmarks. The United capacity purchase agreement has the effect of protecting Air Wisconsin, to an extent, from many of the elements that typically cause volatility in airline financial performance, including fuel prices, variations in ticket prices, and fluctuations in the number of passengers. In providing regional flying under the United capacity purchase agreement, Air Wisconsin uses United’s logos, service marks, and aircraft paint schemes. United controls route selection, pricing, seat inventories, marketing and scheduling. In addition, United provides Air Wisconsin with ground support services and gate access. In October 2020, Air Wisconsin entered into an amendment to the United capacity purchase agreement that, among other things, settled certain disputes that had existed between United and Air Wisconsin over amounts owed to Air Wisconsin under the United capacity purchase agreement. In April 2021, Air Wisconsin entered into a second amendment to the United capacity purchase agreement, which addressed the scheduling of block hours after a certain date. 
 Regional jets provide short and medium-haul scheduled flights that connect outlying communities with larger cities and act as “feeders” for domestic and international hubs. The lower trip costs of regional jets, along with the competitive nature of capacity purchase agreement bidding processes, provide significant value to major airlines. Regional airlines play a daily, essential role in the U.S. air travel system. According to the 2021 Regional Airline Association Annual Report, in 2020 (i) 43% of all scheduled passenger flights in the United States were operated by regional airlines, (ii) of all the U.S. airports with scheduled passenger service, 66% were served exclusively by regional airlines and (iii) Air Wisconsin was the 10th largest regional airline in the United States, as measured by passenger enplanements, and its flights accounted for approximately 2.0% of all passengers carried on U.S. regional airlines.

  Certain Trends Affecting Our Business and Industry 
 The COVID-19 Pandemic 
 As of the date of this filing, there continue to be widespread concerns regarding the ongoing impacts and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the regions in which Air Wisconsin operates. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our industry, business, financial condition, and results of operations in the future is highly uncertain and will be affected by a number of factors. These include the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the development of new variants of the COVID-19 virus that may be more contagious or virulent than prior versions, the issuance, scope and effect of any vaccine mandates and of other mandated or recommended containment and mitigation measures, the effect of government stabilization and recovery efforts, and the success of vaccine distribution programs. 
 Public concerns about the COVID-19 virus, as well as the various governmental guidelines and restrictions adopted to limit the spread of the virus, have had a material adverse impact on passenger demand for air travel since March 2020. While passenger demand for air travel has increased in recent months as a result of the easing of certain of these guidelines and restrictions, as well as expanded availability and adoption of vaccines, United has stated that it expects demand will remain below pre-pandemic levels throughout 2022. 
 Notwithstanding the significant negative impact to our business and the airline industry, Air Wisconsin’s receipt of governmental assistance under the SBA Loan and the Payroll Support Program, described in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within this Annual Report, has mitigated to some extent the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Several regional and larger carriers have ceased operations as a direct or indirect result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the date of this filing, ExpressJet Airlines, Inc., Miami Air International, Trans States Airlines, and Compass Airlines, each of which are domestic, regional, or charter airlines, have either filed for Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or ceased or severely limited operations. The impact of these and other changes to the competitive environment on our business and industry is highly uncertain. 
 Personnel Shortages 
 Historically, the airline industry has experienced periodic shortages of qualified personnel, particularly pilots and mechanics. As a result of the reduced flying caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, these shortages were temporarily abated. However, as flight demand increased through the year ended December 31, 2021 and into 2022, these shortages have become acute, particularly for regional airlines such as Air Wisconsin, due to a number of factors, including retirements and employees seeking opportunities at mainline carriers and in other industries. Air Wisconsin’s monthly departures and scheduled block hours generally increased from June 2020 until October 2021. However, departures and scheduled block hours rarely reached pre-pandemic levels and have declined slightly since October 2021, mostly as a result of pilot shortages. 
 Our Business Strategy 
 Provide Reliable and Efficient Regional Airlines Services. Our primary business strategy currently consists of serving United and its customers through Air Wisconsin’s provision of regional airline services. We strive to serve as an efficient and reliable provider of flight services to United and to provide a high level of service to United and its customers in accordance with the United capacity purchase agreement. We believe that as a result of factors such as increased demand for air transportation and pilot shortages there will continue to be strong demand from major airlines for regional air services, and we seek to position Air Wisconsin to take advantage of this anticipated demand. 
 Maintain a Profitable Business Operation. We seek to maintain a profitable business while operating pursuant to the United capacity purchase agreement. To do so requires that we focus on a disciplined cost control approach through responsible outsourcing of certain operating functions and diligent control of corporate and administrative costs, implementing company-wide efforts to improve our cost position. We also seek to earn incentive payments pursuant to the United capacity purchase agreement and to avoid penalty payments, based upon our operational performance and the results of customer satisfaction surveys.

  Provide an Attractive Career Opportunity. We strive to provide our employees competitive pay and benefit packages and to offer a positive and supportive work environment to make Air Wisconsin an attractive place to work and build a career. 
 Extend the United Capacity Purchase Agreement. The United capacity purchase agreement expires in February 2023. Air Wisconsin and United are in active negotiations regarding the extension of the agreement or the execution of a new agreement, although we can provide no assurance that any agreement will be reached. Accordingly, Air Wisconsin is exploring a commercial agreement with another major airline partner, as well as other business strategies to take advantage of anticipated demand for regional air services. 
Aircraft Fleet 
 As of December 31, 2021, Air Wisconsin owned 64 CRJ-200 regional jets, all of which were manufactured by Bombardier, Inc. (“Bombardier”). The CRJ-200 regional jet offers many of the capabilities and amenities of larger commercial jet aircraft, including flight attendant service, a stand-up cabin, limited overhead and under seat storage, a lavatory and a galley that allows for in-flight snack and beverage service. The CRJ-200 regional jet has a speed comparable to larger aircraft operated by major airlines and has a range of approximately 1,585 miles. 
 United Capacity Purchase Agreement 
 United and Air Wisconsin entered into the United capacity purchase agreement in February 2017, which was amended in October 2020 and April 2021. Pursuant to the United capacity purchase agreement, United has agreed to purchase the capacity of the Air Wisconsin CRJ-200 regional jets covered under the agreement. Air Wisconsin commenced flying under the United capacity purchase agreement in September 2017. As of December 31, 2021, all of Air Wisconsin’s regional jets were available to support Air Wisconsin’s obligations under the United capacity purchase agreement. 
 United sets the flight schedules for covered aircraft, but is required to comply with certain reasonable operating constraints. United also establishes all fares, controls route selection, pricing, seat inventories, and marketing, collects all revenue, and provides airport landing slots, terminal facilities and ground handling services for any flights operated by Air Wisconsin pursuant to the agreement. Air Wisconsin provides the flight and cabin crew and is responsible for dispatch and operational control of each covered aircraft as well as any required maintenance. When providing the flight services under the United capacity purchase agreement, Air Wisconsin uses United’s logos, service marks and aircraft paint scheme. 
 In exchange for providing the flight services under the United capacity purchase agreement, Air Wisconsin receives a fixed payment for 63 covered aircraft and a fixed payment for each departure and block hour flown. Air Wisconsin can also earn incentive payments, and is subject to penalty payments, based upon its operational performance and the results of customer satisfaction surveys. In addition, the first amendment to the United capacity purchase agreement, entered into in October 2020, provides for the payment or accrual of certain amounts by United to Air Wisconsin based on certain scheduling benchmarks. 
 United also reimburses Air Wisconsin for certain costs on an actual basis, including aviation insurance, aircraft property tax per aircraft and air navigation fees. Costs relating to fuel and certain landing fees owed by Air Wisconsin are directly paid to suppliers by United.
 The United capacity purchase agreement previously constrained Air Wisconsin from flying for another air carrier or from permitting a change of control (as defined in the agreement) to occur; however, while a change of control still constitutes a potential termination event, these restrictions were removed in the first amendment to the United capacity purchase agreement. 
 
5 

  The United capacity purchase agreement prohibits Air Wisconsin from paying dividends or making other distributions of its earnings, in each case in excess of an amount that would result in Air Wisconsin’s available cash balance being less than a specified amount, other than dividends or distributions made for certain specified purposes. 
 The United capacity purchase agreement expires in February 2023, subject to a wind-down period. United’s unilateral option to extend the agreement has expired. 
 The United capacity purchase agreement is subject to early termination under various circumstances, which include, among others, the occurrence of the following events: 
 

• | certain operational performance factors falling below a specified percentage for a specified period of time, subject to notice under certain circumstances, or if Air Wisconsin is subject to certain aircraft groundings or to loss of authority to operate, in which case the agreement is subject to early termination by United;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a party fails to perform the material covenants, agreements, terms or conditions of the United capacity purchase agreement or related agreements, subject to certain notice and cure rights, in which case the agreement is subject to early termination by the other party; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Air Wisconsin engages in, or is subject to, various change of control events enumerated in the agreement, in which case the agreement is subject to early termination by United.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Company and AWAC (the sole member of Air Wisconsin) had provided a limited guarantee of Air Wisconsin’s monetary obligations under the United capacity purchase agreement, but that guarantee was terminated pursuant to the first amendment to the United capacity purchase agreement. 
 Long-term contractual agreements, such as the United capacity purchase agreement, are subject to interpretation, and disputes may arise if the parties apply different interpretations to the agreements. Currently, a dispute between United and Air Wisconsin exists with respect to certain amounts owed to Air Wisconsin under the United capacity purchase agreement. We cannot predict the outcome of this dispute, or any related negotiations, on the terms of the United capacity purchase agreement or our relationship with United. 
 Available Seat Miles 
 The following table summarizes Air Wisconsin’s available seat miles (“ASMs”) flown and contract revenue recognized under the United capacity purchase agreement for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively: 

 | Year EndedDecember 31,2021 | | Year EndedDecember 31,2020 | 
 | (dollars in thousands) | 
Available Seat Miles | | 1,310,157 | | | 864,494
Contract Revenue | $ | 247,519 | | $ | 185,866

Maintenance and Repairs 
 Airlines are subject to extensive regulation. Air Wisconsin has a Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”)-mandated and approved maintenance program. Aircraft maintenance and repair consists of routine and non-routine maintenance, and work performed is divided into three general categories: line maintenance, heavy maintenance and component service. Air Wisconsin also outsources certain aircraft, engine and other component maintenance functions. To procure these services, Air Wisconsin uses competitive bidding among qualified vendors. 
 Line maintenance consists of routine daily and weekly scheduled maintenance checks on Air Wisconsin’s aircraft. Line maintenance is performed at certain locations throughout Air Wisconsin’s operation and represents the majority of the maintenance Air Wisconsin performs. Heavy maintenance consists of a series of major airframe maintenance checks that can take from one to six weeks to accomplish, on average, across Air Wisconsin’s fleet. 
 
6 

  Component service includes engine overhauls and engine performance restoration events, which are quite extensive and can take several months. We maintain an inventory of spare engines at both Air Wisconsin and Lotus to provide for continued operations during scheduled and unscheduled engine maintenance events. Air Wisconsin provides maintenance services for its CRJ-200 regional jets and for its owned and leased engines and equipment. 
 Competition 
 The airline industry is highly competitive. We consider Air Wisconsin’s primary competition to be those U.S. regional airlines that currently have or compete for capacity purchase agreements with major airlines. Air Wisconsin’s competition includes nearly every other domestic regional airline, including CommutAir; Endeavor, Inc. (owned by Delta); Envoy Air, Inc., PSA Airlines, Inc. and Piedmont Airlines, Inc. (Envoy, PSA and Piedmont are owned by American); GoJet Airlines, LLC; Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (owned by Alaska Air Group, Inc.); Mesa Airlines, Inc.; Republic Airways Holdings Inc.; and SkyWest Inc. 
 We believe that major airlines typically select regional airline partners based on the following criteria: aircraft type, ability to fly proposed schedules; availability of labor resources, including pilots; proposed economic terms; aircraft and engine resources; financial resources; operational reliability; reputation; customer service levels; and other factors. 
 Certain Air Wisconsin competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than Air Wisconsin. In addition, certain of these competitors may have capacity purchase agreement terms that are more favorable than the United capacity purchase agreement. Moreover, economic downturns, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with competitive pressures, have contributed to a number of reorganizations, bankruptcies, liquidations and business combinations among major and regional carriers which has resulted in changes to the competitive landscape. The effect of economic downturns on our results of operations is currently somewhat mitigated by the terms of the United capacity purchase agreement, but there is an ongoing dispute with United regarding certain terms of the agreement, and the extension of Air Wisconsin’s partnership with United beyond the current term is not certain. 
 Aircraft Fuel 
 The United capacity purchase agreement provides that United sources, procures and directly pays third-party vendors for substantially all fuel used in the performance of the agreement. 
Insurance 
 Air Wisconsin maintains insurance policies we believe are of types customary for the airline industry and as required by the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), lessors and other financing parties, and United under the terms of the United capacity purchase agreement. The policies principally provide liability coverage for public and passenger injury; damage to property; loss of or damage to flight equipment; fire; auto; directors’ and officers’ liability; fiduciary liability; workers’ compensation and employer’s liability; and war risk (terrorism). Although we currently believe Air Wisconsin’s insurance coverage is adequate, we cannot be certain that the amount of such coverage will not change or that Air Wisconsin will not bear substantial losses from incidents or accidents. 
Employees 
 Our continued success is partly dependent on Air Wisconsin’s ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel. As of December 31, 2021, Air Wisconsin employed 1,212 full-time employees and 36 part-time employees, of whom 995 were represented by unions, and the remainder were not.

Air Wisconsin has never been the subject of a labor strike or labor action that materially impacted its operations. 
 FAA regulations require pilots to have an Airline Transport Pilot license with specific ratings for the aircraft to be flown and to be medically certified as physically fit to fly. FAA and medical certifications are subject to periodic renewal requirements including recurrent training and recent flying experience. Mechanics, quality-control inspectors, and flight dispatchers must be certificated and qualified for specific aircraft. Flight attendants must have initial and periodic competency training and qualification. Training programs are subject to approval and monitoring by the FAA. Management personnel directly involved in the supervision of flight operations, training, maintenance, and aircraft inspection must also meet experience standards prescribed by FAA regulations. All employees performing a safety-sensitive function are subject to pre-employment, random, and post-accident drug testing. 
 Air Wisconsin maintains relationships with various flight and maintenance institutions across the country that are focused on developing the next generation of aviation professionals. It typically recruits pilots and mechanics who have completed required coursework from accredited flight or maintenance programs and have obtained applicable certifications. Air Wisconsin also provides internship opportunities to individuals in the process of completing their coursework and training for aviation maintenance. These roles provide hands-on experience for the students and prepares them for other opportunities within Air Wisconsin. 
 Our approach is to hire the best qualified individuals, regardless of race, religion, gender, national origin, disability, sexual orientation or similar classifications. We believe every employee brings unique education, skills and life experiences to Air Wisconsin that supplement our ability to achieve our commitment to excellence to our customers and passengers. As part of our commitment to diversity, we have created ongoing opportunities to highlight employees from different cultures on internal and external websites, and we have participated in events and provided sponsorships for diversity organizations focused on aviation. 
 Safety and Security 
 We are committed to the safety and security of Air Wisconsin’s passengers and employees and to complying with safety and security requirements. Air Wisconsin has taken many steps, both voluntarily and as mandated by governmental authorities, to increase the safety and security of its operations. Some of these efforts include aircraft security and surveillance and securing of cockpit doors. Additionally, both on its own and in coordination with United, Air Wisconsin has required employees to wear masks and has increased its aircraft cleaning procedures both between flights and overnight. Enhanced cleaning measures are intended to ensure that frequently touched surfaces, such as armrests, tray tables and seatbelts, are routinely and comprehensively cleaned utilizing disinfectants to prevent transmission of COVID-19 and other contagions. An increased supply of sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizer onboard Air Wisconsin’s aircraft is available to aid its crewmembers in efforts to keep the aircraft clean and disinfected. 
 Air Wisconsin’s ongoing focus on safety and security relies on training Air Wisconsin’s employees to proper standards and providing them with the tools and equipment they need to perform their job functions in a safe and efficient manner. Safety and security in the workplace targets several areas of Air Wisconsin’s operation, including dispatch, flight operations, ground operations, and maintenance. 
 
8 

  Air Wisconsin aims to achieve the highest degree of safety and security within its industry through the implementation of a corporate-wide Safety Management System supporting its organizational culture that holds safety and security as essential core values. Air Wisconsin continually works to create and foster a culture of safety, security and compliance that proactively identifies and manages risks to the operation and workplace before they can become injuries, incidents or accidents. All Air Wisconsin employees are required to maintain the highest levels of safety and security throughout its operation and organization and to proactively identify and immediately report hazards, safety concerns and incidents as well as any behavior that violates Air Wisconsin’s policies, regulatory requirements, laws and industry standards. 
 The Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) is responsible for certain civil aviation security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports. Air Wisconsin is currently in compliance with the directives issued by the TSA and maintains active, open lines of communication with the TSA to ensure proper standards for security of its personnel, equipment and facilities are exercised throughout its operation. 
 Government Regulation 
 Aviation Regulation 
 The DOT and FAA have regulatory authority over air transportation in the United States and all international air service is subject to certain U.S. federal requirements and approvals, as well as the regulatory requirements of the appropriate authorities of the foreign countries involved. The DOT has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity, exemptions and other economic authority required for airlines to provide domestic and foreign air transportation. International routes and international code-sharing arrangements are regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved. A U.S. airline’s ability to operate flights to and from international destinations is subject to the air transport agreements between the United States and the foreign country and the carrier’s ability to obtain the necessary authority from the DOT and the applicable foreign government. 
 The FAA is responsible for regulating and overseeing matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including the control of navigable air space, the qualification of flight personnel, flight training practices, compliance with FAA airline operating certificate requirements, aircraft certification and maintenance requirements. The FAA requires each commercial airline to obtain and hold an FAA air carrier certificate. Air Wisconsin currently holds an air carrier certificate with Federal Aviation Regulation Part-121 operation specifications. 
 Foreign Ownership 
 Under DOT regulations and federal law, Air Wisconsin must be owned and controlled directly and indirectly by citizens of the United States. The restrictions imposed by federal law and regulations currently require that at least 75% of Air Wisconsin’s voting equity securities must be owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by persons or entities who are citizens of the United States, as defined in the Federal Aviation Act and interpreted by the DOT, that the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Air Wisconsin’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and at least two-thirds of the members of Air Wisconsin’s board of managers and the Company’s board of directors and other managing officers be citizens of the United States, and that Air Wisconsin and the Company be under the actual control of citizens of the United States. In addition, at least 51% of Air Wisconsin’s total outstanding equity securities must be owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by citizens of the United States and no more than 49% of its equity securities may be held, directly or indirectly, by persons or entities who are not U.S. citizens and are from countries that have entered into “open skies” air transport agreements with the U.S. which allow unrestricted access on air service routes between the United States and the applicable foreign country and to points beyond the foreign country on flights serving the foreign country. No more than 25% of Air Wisconsin’s equity securities may be held, directly or indirectly, by persons or entities who are not U.S. citizens and are from countries that have not entered into an “open skies” air transport agreement with the U.S. We are currently in compliance with these ownership provisions. In addition, the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the Company’s amended and restated bylaws currently prohibit the transfer of any shares of the Company’s capital stock that would result in (i) any person or entity becoming a “Five-Percent Stockholder” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-2T(g)) of our then-outstanding capital stock, or (ii) an increase in the percentage ownership of any person or entity who is already a “Five-Percent Stockholder” of our then-outstanding capital stock. These restrictions on the transfer of the Company’s capital stock inhibit the acquisition of control of Air Wisconsin by any foreign citizen.

  Consumer Protection Regulation 
 The DOT also has jurisdiction over certain consumer protection matters related to air transportation. This covers unfair or deceptive practices, unfair methods of competition, advertising, denied boarding compensation, ticket refunds, baggage liability, contracts of carriage, customer service commitments, customer complaints and transportation of passengers with disabilities. The DOT has adopted consumer protection rules regulating lengthy tarmac delays, chronically delayed flights, codeshare disclosure and undisclosed display bias. The DOT also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements, code-sharing agreements (where an airline places its designator code on a flight operated by another airline) and wet-leasing agreements (where one airline provides aircraft and crew to another airline) between carriers and regulates other economic matters such as slot transactions. In the future, the DOT may adopt additional regulations that increase the costs of Air Wisconsin’s operations or otherwise adversely impact our financial performance. 
Environmental Regulation 
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection matters. These laws and regulations govern such matters as environmental reporting, storage and disposal of materials and chemicals and aircraft noise. We are not currently subject to any environmental cleanup orders or actions imposed by regulatory authorities. We are not aware of any active material environmental investigations related to our assets or properties. 
 The Environmental Protection Agency regulates operations, including air carrier operations, which affect the quality of air in the United States. Concern about climate change and greenhouse gases may result in additional regulation or taxation of aircraft emissions in the United States and abroad. 
 Federal law recognizes the right of airport operators with special noise problems to implement local noise abatement procedures so long as those procedures do not interfere unreasonably with interstate and foreign commerce and the national air transportation system. These restrictions can include limiting nighttime operations, directing specific aircraft operational procedures during takeoff and initial climb, and limiting the overall number of flights at an airport. 
 Air Wisconsin remains committed to lowering its environmental footprint while continuing to offer safe and reliable service to its customers and the communities it serves. Through the use of software and training, Air Wisconsin manages its fuel usage in an effort to conserve fuel and reduce emissions. When possible, Air Wisconsin mitigates fuel usage by taxiing with the use of a single engine, improving the efficiency of aircraft routing, and using ground power when an aircraft is parked at the gate. Air Wisconsin has also implemented recycling initiatives and has worked aggressively to reduce its reliance on paper manuals and logs.

Public Reporting Obligation 
 Notwithstanding that the Company is currently required to file certain reports and information with the SEC pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company does not have a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company is not required to comply with, and does not intend to follow, certain disclosure requirements typically applicable to public reporting companies, including the requirement to file proxy statements, information statements, tender offer disclosures, and beneficial ownership filings. If the Company becomes eligible to suspend its public reporting obligations in future periods, it may elect to take the actions necessary to suspend those obligations, which could result in the Company no longer being required to file SEC reports.
