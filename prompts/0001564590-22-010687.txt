ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS 
 Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (the “Corporation”) was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1929. The Corporation, individually or together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is also referred to herein as the “Registrant.” The Corporation manufactures and sells highly engineered, high-performance specialty metal products and customized equipment utilized by industry throughout the world. It

operates in two business segments – the Forged and Cast Engineered Products (“FCEP”) segment and the Air and Liquid Processing (“ALP”) segment. This segment presentation is consistent with how the Corporation’s chief operating decision maker evaluates financial performance and makes resource allocation and strategic decisions about the business.
 On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency caused by a new strain of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and advised of the risks to the international community as the virus spread globally. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. In response, many state and local governments required the closure of various businesses. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, however, issued guidance outlining criteria to identify domestic businesses as operating in critical infrastructure industries, essential to the economic prosperity, security and continuity of the United States, which provides exceptions to certain closures mandated by state and local governments and permits businesses to continue operations during such an order. The Corporation’s domestic businesses were, and continue to be, deemed to participate in critical infrastructure industries; however, despite the designation and particularly in 2020, the Corporation has had to periodically and temporarily idle certain operations of its FCEP segment and, consequently, furlough certain of its employees in response to market conditions. While most of these direct impacts were experienced in 2020, as variants have developed, the Corporation has experienced episodic disruptions to its operations or the operations of its customers and suppliers. The pandemic also has spurred disruptions to the global supply chain, which is believed to be a key factor in the global inflationary pressures of 2021. Accordingly, the Corporation has experienced, and may continue to experience, customer-requested delays of deliveries or cancellation of orders, lower order intake resulting from customers postponing projects, inability to obtain raw materials and supplies critical to the manufacturing process, delays in receiving and shipping product due to the lack of transportation, and higher cost of production and transportation.
 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
 Forged and Cast Engineered Products Segment 
 The FCEP segment produces forged hardened steel rolls, cast rolls and forged engineered products (“FEP”). Forged hardened steel rolls are used primarily in cold rolling mills by producers of steel, aluminum and other metals. Cast rolls, which are produced in a variety of iron and steel qualities, are used mainly in hot and cold strip mills, medium/heavy section mills and plate mills. FEP principally are sold to customers in the steel distribution market, oil and gas industry and the aluminum and plastic extrusion industries. The segment has operations in the United States, England, Sweden, and Slovenia and an equity interest in three joint venture companies in China. Collectively, the segment primarily competes with European, Asian and North and South American companies in both domestic and foreign markets and distributes a significant portion of its products through sales offices located throughout the world. 
 Union Electric Steel Corporation produces forged hardened steel rolls and FEP. It is headquartered in Carnegie, Pennsylvania, with three manufacturing facilities in Pennsylvania and one in Indiana. The following entities are direct or indirect operating subsidiaries of Union Electric Steel Corporation:
 Union Electric Steel UK Limited produces cast rolls in a variety of iron and steel qualities for hot and cold strip mills, medium/heavy section mills and plate mills. It is located in Gateshead, England.
 Åkers Sweden AB produces cast rolls in a variety of iron and steel qualities for hot strip finishing mills, roughing mills, plate mills, and medium/heavy section mills. It is located in Åkers Styckebruk, Sweden. 
 Åkers Valji Ravne d.o.o. produces forged rolls for cluster mills and Z-Hi mills, work rolls for narrow and wide strip and aluminum mills, back-up rolls for narrow strip mills, and leveling rolls and shafts. It is located in Ravne, Slovenia.

Air and Liquid Processing Segment 
 The ALP segment includes Aerofin, Buffalo Air Handling and Buffalo Pumps, all divisions of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation (“Air & Liquid”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation. The segment has operations in Virginia and New York with headquarters in Carnegie, Pennsylvania. The segment distributes a significant portion of its products through a common independent group of sales offices located throughout the United States and has several major competitors.
 Aerofin Division of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation produces custom-engineered finned tube heat exchange coils and related heat transfer products for a variety of industries including OEM/commercial, nuclear power generation and industrial manufacturing. It is located in Lynchburg, Virginia. 
 Buffalo Air Handling Division of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation produces large custom-designed air handling systems for institutional (e.g., hospital, university), pharmaceutical and general industrial building markets. It is located in Amherst, Virginia. 
 Buffalo Pumps Division of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation manufactures centrifugal pumps for the fossil fueled power generation, marine defense and industrial refrigeration industries. It is located in North Tonawanda, New York. 
 Products
 In both segments, the products are dependent on engineering, principally custom designed, and are sold to sophisticated commercial and industrial users located throughout the world. Products are delivered directly to the customer via third-party carriers or customer-arranged transportation. For the FCEP segment, no customers exceeded 10% of its net sales in 2021, and one customer accounted for approximately 11% of its net sales in 2020. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on the segment. For the ALP segment, no customers exceeded 10% of its net sales in 2021 or 2020. For additional information on the products produced and financial information about each segment, see Note 16, Revenue, and Note 23, Business Segments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Raw Materials 
 Raw materials used in both segments are generally available from many sources, and neither segment is dependent upon any single supplier for any raw material. Substantial volumes of raw materials used by each segment are subject to significant variations in price. The Corporation’s subsidiaries generally do not purchase or commit for the purchase of a major portion of raw materials significantly in advance of the time they require such materials but do make forward commitments for natural gas, electricity and certain commodities (copper and aluminum). See Note 14, Derivative Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Patents and Trademarks 
 While the Corporation and its subsidiaries hold certain patents, trademarks and licenses, in the opinion of the Corporation, they are not material to either segment. 
 Backlog
 The backlog of orders at December 31, 2021, was approximately $292.5 million compared to a backlog of $246.1 million at year-end 2020. Both segments contributed to the improvement in backlog. Backlog for the FCEP segment increased by approximately $31.4 million year over year due to a combination of (i) higher orders for FEP as a result of increased demand from the steel distribution and oil and gas markets, (ii) improved pricing for FEP and mill rolls and (iii) higher variable-index surcharges included in backlog. Backlog for the ALP segment increased by approximately $15.0 million and benefited from improved order intake for each of its product lines. Approximately 6% of the backlog is expected to be released after 2022.
Competition 
 The Corporation faces considerable competition from a large number of companies in both segments. The Corporation believes, however, that its subsidiaries are significant participants in each of the niche markets that they serve. Competition in both segments is based on quality, service, price, and delivery. 
Environmental Protection Compliance Costs 
 Expenditures for environmental control matters were not material to either segment in 2021 and are not expected to be material in 2022.
