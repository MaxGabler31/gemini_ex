General
Itron is among the leading technology and services companies dedicated to the resourceful use of electricity, natural gas, and water. We provide comprehensive solutions that measure, manage, and analyze energy and water use. Our broad product portfolio helps utilities responsibly and efficiently manage resources.
With increasing populations and resource consumption, there continues to be growing demand for electricity, natural gas, and water. This demand comes at a time when utilities are challenged by cost constraints, regulatory requirements, environmental concerns and water scarcity. Our solution is to provide utilities with the knowledge they need to optimize their resources, improve their efficiency and to better understand and serve their customers - knowledge that gives their customers control over their energy and water needs and allows for better management and conservation of valuable resources.
We were incorporated in 1977 with a focus on meter reading technology. In 2004, we entered the electricity meter manufacturing business with the acquisition of Schlumberger Electricity Metering. In 2007, we expanded our presence in global meter manufacturing and systems with the acquisition of Actaris Metering Systems SA. In 2017, we completed our acquisition of Comverge by purchasing the stock of its parent, Peak Holding Corp. (Comverge), which enabled us to offer integrated cloud-based demand response, energy efficiency and customer engagement solutions. In 2018, we will strengthen our ability to deliver a broader set of solutions, increase the pace of growth and innovation in the smart city and industrial Internet of Important ThingsTM markets with the acquisition of Silver Spring Networks, Inc. (SSNI).
The following is a discussion of our major products, our markets, and our operating segments. Refer to Item 8: “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for specific segment results.
Our Business 
We offer solutions that enable electric and natural gas utilities to build smart grids to manage assets, secure revenue, lower operational costs, improve customer service, and enable demand response. Our solutions include standard meters and next-generation smart metering products, metering systems, software and services, which ultimately empower and benefit consumers.
We supply comprehensive solutions to address the unique challenges facing the water industry, including increasing demand and resource scarcity. We offer a complete product portfolio, including standard meters and smart metering products, systems, and services, for applications in the residential and commercial industrial markets for water and heat.

We offer a portfolio of services to our customers from standalone services to end-to-end solutions. These include licensing meter data management and analytics software, managed services, software-as-a-service (SaaS), technical support services, licensing hardware technology, and consulting services.
We classify metering systems into two categories: standard metering systems and smart metering solutions. These categories are described in more detail below:
Standard Metering Systems
Standard metering systems employ a standard meter, which measures electricity, natural gas, water, or thermal energy by mechanical, electromechanical, or electronic means, with no built-in remote-reading communication capability. Standard meters require manual reading, which is typically performed by a utility representative or meter reading service provider. Worldwide, we produce standard residential, commercial and industrial (C&I), and transmission and distribution (T&D) electricity, natural gas, water, and heat meters.
Smart Metering Solutions
Smart metering solutions employ meters or modules with one-way or two-way communication capability embedded in or attached to a meter to collect and store meter data, which is transmitted to handheld computers, mobile units, telephone, radio frequency (RF), cellular, power line carrier (PLC), fixed networks, or through adaptive communication technology (ACT). ACT enables dynamic selection of the optimal communications path, utilizing RF or PLC, based on network operating conditions, data attributes and application requirements. This allows utilities to collect and analyze meter data to optimize operations, store interval data, remotely connect and disconnect service to the meter, send data, receive commands, and interface with other devices, such as in-home displays, smart thermostats and appliances, home area networks, and advanced control systems.
Our Operating Segments
We operate under the Itron brand worldwide and manage and report under three operating segments: Electricity, Gas, and Water. Our Water operating segment includes both our global water, and heat and allocation solutions. This structure allows each segment to develop its own go-to-market strategy, prioritize its marketing and product development requirements, and focus on its strategic investments. Our sales and marketing functions are managed under each segment. Our product development and manufacturing operations are managed on a worldwide basis to promote a global perspective in our operations and processes while serving the needs of our segments.
Comverge's technologies have been integrated into our Electricity segment's increasing software and services offerings. We completed the acquisition of SSNI on January 5, 2018 and SSNI became our wholly-owned subsidiary, changing its name to Itron Networked Solutions, Inc. This entity will operate and be managed as a separate operating segment, allowing it to maintain focus, ensure business continuity and successfully deliver on customer commitments established by SSNI. Product, solution and service branding used under the Itron brand will be reviewed as part of integrating Itron Networked Solutions Inc. 
Bookings and Backlog of Orders
Bookings for a reported period represent customer contracts and purchase orders received during the period for hardware, software, and services that have met certain conditions, such as regulatory and/or contractual approval. Total backlog represents committed but undelivered contracts and purchase orders at period-end. Twelve-month backlog represents the portion of total backlog that we estimate will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Backlog is not a complete measure of our future revenues as we also receive significant book-and-ship orders as well as Frame Contracts. Bookings and backlog may fluctuate significantly due to the timing of large project awards. In addition, annual or multi-year contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the long-term nature of the contracts. Beginning total backlog, plus bookings, minus revenues, will not equal ending total backlog due to miscellaneous contract adjustments, foreign currency fluctuations, and other factors.

Year Ended | Total Bookings | | Total Backlog (1) | | 12-Month Backlog (2)
 | (in millions) 
December 31, 2017 | $ | 1,993 | | | $ | 1,750 | | $ | 931
December 31, 2016 | 2,066 | | | 1,652 | | | 761
December 31, 2015 | 1,981 | | | 1,575 | | | 836


(1) | Backlog includes $116.3 million related to Comverge as of December 31, 2017.


(2) | 12-month backlog includes $35.1 million related to Comverge as of December 31, 2017.

Information on bookings by our operating segments is as follows:

Year Ended | Total Bookings | | Electricity | | Gas | | Water
 | (in millions) 
December 31, 2017 | $ | 1,993 | | | $ | 997 | | $ | 502 | $ | 494
December 31, 2016 | 2,066 | | | 1,013 | | | 567 | | 486
December 31, 2015 | 1,981 | | | 958 | | | 577 | | 446

Sales and Distribution
We use a combination of direct and indirect sales channels in our operating segments. A direct sales force is utilized for large electric, natural gas, and water utilities, with which we have long-established relationships. For smaller utilities, we typically use an indirect sales force that consists of distributors, sales representatives, partners, and meter manufacturer representatives.
No single customer represented more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Our 10 largest customers in each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, accounted for approximately 33%, 31%, and 22% of total revenues, respectively.
Manufacturing
Our products require a wide variety of components and materials, which are subject to price and supply fluctuations. We enter into standard purchase orders in the ordinary course of business, which can include purchase orders for specific quantities based on market prices, as well as open-ended agreements that provide for estimated quantities over an extended shipment period, typically up to one year at an established unit cost. Although we have multiple sources of supply for many of our material requirements, certain components and raw materials are supplied by limited or sole-source vendors, and our ability to perform certain contracts depends on the availability of these materials. Refer to Item 1A: “Risk Factors,” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further discussion related to supply risks.
Our manufacturing facilities are located throughout the world, an overview of which is presented in Item 2: “Properties,” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we manufacture and assemble the majority of our products, we outsource the manufacturing of certain products to various manufacturing partners. This approach allows us to reduce our costs as it reduces our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust more quickly to changing end-customer demand. These partners assemble our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and procure components and assemble our products based on demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions, as adjusted for overall market conditions.
Partners
In connection with delivering products and systems to our customers, we may partner with third party vendors to provide hardware, software, or services, e.g., meter installation and communication network equipment and infrastructure. Our ability to perform on our contractual obligations with our customers is dependent on these partners meeting their obligations to us. 
Product Development
Our product development is focused on both improving existing technology and developing innovative new technology for electricity, natural gas, water and heat meters, sensing and control devices, data collection software, communication technologies, data warehousing, and software applications. We invested approximately $170 million, $168 million, and $162 million in product development in 2017, 2016 and 2015, which represented 8% of total revenues for 2017, 8% of total revenues for 2016 and 9% of total revenues in 2015.
Workforce
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 7,800 people in our workforce, including 6,500 permanent employees. We have not experienced significant employee work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
