Item 1. Business 
The Company 
 Office Depot provides a broad selection of products and services to consumers and businesses of all sizes. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1986 and opened our first retail store in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. At December 30, 2017, we operated through three reportable segments (or Divisions): Retail Division, Business Solutions Division and the CompuCom Division. The CompuCom Division was formed as a result of the acquisition of CompuCom Systems, Inc. (CompuCom) during the fourth quarter of 2017. Following the third quarter 2016 commitment to sell substantially all of the international operations outside of North America, the business formerly reported as the International Division was reclassified to discontinued operations. We regularly evaluate the appropriateness of our reportable segments based on how we manage the business, including making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the segments, particularly in light of organizational changes, merger and acquisition activity and changing laws and regulations. Therefore, our current reportable segments may change in the future. 
 Sales for the Divisions are processed through multiple channels, consisting of retail stores, a business to business sales force, internet sites, an inside sales organization, direct marketing catalogs and call centers, all supported by a network of supply chain facilities and delivery operations. Office Depot currently operates under several brands, including Office Depot ®, OfficeMax ®, and CompuCom ® brands and utilizes other proprietary company and product brand names, including Grand & Toy ® in Canada.

 Additional information regarding our Divisions and operations in geographic areas is presented in Part II  Item 7. MD&A and in Note 17, Segment Information, of the Consolidated Financial Statements located in Part IV  Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report. 
 Acquisitions 
 To further our transformation into a more business services-driven platform and to strengthen our core business operations, we acquired five businesses during 2017, including CompuCom, a market leading provider of award winning information technology (IT) services, products, and solutions to North American enterprise organizations. The other businesses acquired in August 2017 and October 2017 were four small independent regional office supply businesses in the United States. The total purchase price for these four small acquisitions was approximately $100 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, and were funded with cash on hand. The acquisitions of these four businesses will provide us with improved access to small, mid-market and large business customers in select geographic markets within the United States across a diverse assortment, including cleaning and breakroom, furniture and office supplies. The operating results of these four companies are combined with our operating results subsequent to their purchase dates, and are included in the Business Solutions Division segment. 
 On November 8, 2017, we completed the acquisition of CompuCom through acquiring all of their capital stock for approximately $937 million. The acquisition was funded with a new $750 million 5-year term loan facility, approximately 44 million shares of Office Depot common stock with an approximate market value of $135 million at the time of the acquisition, and approximately $52 million of cash on hand. The acquisition of CompuCom is expected to accelerate our ability to pursue topline services growth as it provides us the opportunity to offer world-class IT support services to all of our customers, including enterprise, small and medium sized businesses. The operating results of CompuCom are combined with our operating results subsequent to the purchase date, and are included in the CompuCom Division. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
Discontinued Operations 
 In September 2016, our Board of Directors committed to a plan to sell substantially all of our international operations, formerly reported as the International Division through four disposal groups (Europe, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand (Oceania) and mainland China). 
 We completed the sale of our operations in Europe (the European Business) to The AURELIUS Group on December 31, 2016, our business in South Korea on April 26, 2017 and our business in mainland China on July 28, 2017. We retained the sourcing and trading operations of the former International Division, which are presented as Other in Note 17, Segment Information, of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In April 2017, we announced that we had entered into a definitive sale and purchase agreement to sell our businesses in Australia and New Zealand, which was subject to regulatory approval. In November 2017, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission announced that it would not oppose the sale. However, the Commerce Commission of New Zealand filed proceedings in the High Court to enjoin the contemplated transaction. The trial date is not yet scheduled. In February 2018, we entered into an amended sale and purchase agreement with the purchaser to sell the businesses in Australia and New Zealand in two separate transactions. The sale of the business in Australia was completed on February 5, 2018. The timing of the sale of the New Zealand business is contingent on the purchaser obtaining regulatory approval, we and the purchaser remain committed to completing the sale. 
 Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 Termination of Staples Acquisition 
 On February 4, 2015, we entered into a definitive merger agreement (the Staples Merger Agreement) with Staples, Inc. (Staples) under which Staples was to acquire all of our outstanding shares and we would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Staples. 
 On May 10, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the United States Federal Trade Commissions (the FTC) request for a preliminary injunction against the proposed acquisition, and as a result, we announced the termination of the Staples Merger Agreement. Per the terms of the termination agreement, Staples paid us a fee of $250 million in cash on May 19, 2016. Refer to Note 3, Merger and Restructuring Activity of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Fiscal Year 
 Our fiscal year results are based on a 52- or 53-week retail calendar ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal year 2017 had 52 weeks and ended on December 30, 2017. Fiscal year 2016 had 53 weeks and ended on December 31, 2016, and fiscal year 2015 consisted of 52 weeks and ended on December 26, 2015. Subsidiary businesses, including CompuCom (acquired in 2017), and Grand & Toy operate on a calendar year basis; however, the reporting difference did not have a material impact in 2017 and the other periods presented. 
Retail Division 
 The Retail Division sells a broad assortment of merchandise through our chain of office supply stores throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The retail stores operate under their legacy brands of Office Depot or OfficeMax, though systems, processes and offerings have converged. We currently offer products and services in the following categories: supplies, technology, and furniture and other. Refer to the Merchandising and Services section below for additional product information. Retail stores also offer copy, print services and tech services. 
 At the end of 2017, the Retail Division operated 1,378 office supply stores. The count of open stores may include locations temporarily closed for remodeling or other factors. We have a broad representation across North America with the largest concentration of our retail stores in Texas, California, and Florida. The majority of our retail stores are located in leased facilities that currently average over 20,000 square feet. 
 As part of the integration of the Office Depot and OfficeMax stores, we announced a real estate plan (the Real Estate Strategy) in 2014, which included the closure of 400 stores in North America. During the second quarter of 2016, we completed the retail store closures under this program. In execution of this strategy, we closed 51 stores in 2016, 181 stores in 2015 and 168 stores in 2014. Closures included both Office Depot and OfficeMax locations. Implementation of this strategy resulted in charges for facility closures, termination costs, and asset impairments, but also contributed to improved comparable store sales due to the consolidation of customers into fewer locations and improved operating performance of the Retail Division during these periods. In August 2016, we announced the results of a comprehensive business review (the Comprehensive Business Review), which, among other things, included the anticipated closing of an additional 300 stores over a three year period. Under this program, we closed 63 stores in 2017 and 72 stores in 2016 (for a total of 135 stores closed) and anticipate closing approximately 20 during 2018. However, as part of a new omni-channel strategy, we have decided to significantly slow the pace of future store closures. We will continue to re-evaluate the store closure program on an annual basis. Refer to Part II  Item 7. MD&A for additional information on store activity. 
 Concurrent with announcement of the Comprehensive Business Review, we announced the launch of our new store concept. These converted stores have been redesigned to enhance the customer experience through a curated assortment of products, better product adjacencies, easier navigation and signage and increased space dedicated to expanded services offerings. Through the end of 2017, we have converted 63 locations to this new 
 
3 


  format. During 2017, as part of our transformation into a more business services-driven platform, our new store concept continued to evolve and in February 2018, we unveiled a makeover of 14 of our stores in the Austin, Texas market, including a flagship location BizBox: Powered by Office Depot  that integrates our recently launched BizBox offering into our retail locations. Our new BizBox stores combine digital services with traditional office products, and feature a new look and feel, including: an open floor plan with dedicated BizBox consulting hubs, in-store networking space, and professional tech support in a designated Tech-Zone. Refer to the Merchandising and Services discussion below for additional information about BizBox. 
 To better serve our customers any way they choose to shop, we have embraced an omni-channel focus in our retail, contract and direct channels. For example, we have a Buy Online-Pickup in Store offering in all locations and have added Buy Online-Ship from Store capability in almost all of our locations. These features help provide products to our customers faster and will enable us to better manage inventory across the Company. Store delivery is offered in select markets. Sales under these programs are serviced by store employees and fulfilled with store inventory and therefore are reported in the Retail Division results. 
 Refer to the Supply Chain discussion below for additional information about our supply chain network. 
 Business Solutions Division 
 The Business Solutions Division sells nationally branded and our private branded products and services to customers in the United States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada. Office Depot customers are primarily served through a dedicated sales force, catalogs, telesales, and electronically through our internet sites. Refer to the Merchandising and Services section below for additional product information. The Business Solutions Division also offers copy and print services. 
 Our contract sales channel employs a dedicated inside and field sales force that services the office supply needs to a range of small, medium and large-sized businesses. Our contract business customers also include various schools and local, state and national governmental agencies. We also enter into agreements with consortiums to sell to various entities and across industries, including governmental and non-profit entities, for non-exclusive buying arrangements. Sales to our contract customers that are fulfilled by Office Depot retail locations are included in the results of our Retail Division, while honoring their contract pricing, as applicable. Migration of the legacy OfficeMax customers to Office Depot systems is substantially complete. However, a limited number of OfficeMax customer conversions will continue into early 2018. 
 Our direct sales channel primarily serves small- to medium-sized customers. Direct customers can order products through our public websites, from our catalogs, or by phone. Website functionality provides customers the convenience of using the loyalty program and offers suggestions by product ratings, pricing, and brand, among other features. Customer orders are fulfilled through our common supply chain; refer to the Supply Chain discussion below for additional information on our supply chain network. 
 CompuCom Division 
 The CompuCom Division was formed during the fourth quarter of 2017 after completion of our acquisition of CompuCom and includes all of the activities of CompuCom. CompuCom procures, installs and manages the lifecycle of hardware and software for businesses, and offers IT support services including remote help desk, data centers and on-site IT professionals to North American enterprise organizations in the United States, Canada and Costa Rica. The largest service offering is end user computing, which provides on-site services to assist corporate end users with their IT support needs. CompuCom provides a single point of contact for the management of the customers IT infrastructure including platform selection, provisioning, deployment and maintenance. 
 Supply Chain 
 We operate a network of distribution centers (or DCs) and crossdock facilities across the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada, including the three DCs which support the operations of CompuCom. Our DCs operate to 
 
4 


  fulfill customer orders while crossdocks are smaller flow-through facilities where merchandise is sorted for distribution and shipped to fulfill the inventory needs of our retail locations. Excluding the three DCs supporting the CompuCom operations, DC and crossdock facilities costs, including real estate, technology, labor, depreciation and inventory are allocated to the Retail Division and Business Solutions Division based on the relative services provided. For the three DCs related to the CompuCom operations, these costs are included within the CompuCom Division. 
 Through the end of 2017, we have closed 15 DCs and crossdock facilities in connection with the OfficeMax merger integration. The changes to the supply chain related to the OfficeMax merger, including planned closures and system conversions, were completed in 2017. 
 We believe that inventory held in our DCs is at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated customer needs. Certain purchases are sent directly from the manufacturer to our customers or retail stores. Some supply chain facilities and some retail locations also house sales offices, showrooms, and administrative offices supporting our contract sales channel. 
 As of December 30, 2017, we operated 51 DCs and crossdock facilities in the United States and Canada. Refer to Item 2. Properties for further information. 
 Out-bound delivery and inbound direct import operations are currently provided by third-party carriers along with our own vehicles. 
 Merchandising and Services 
 Our merchandising and services strategy is to meet our customers needs by offering a broad selection of branded office products, as well as our own branded products and services. The selection of our own branded products has increased in breadth and level of sophistication over time. We currently offer products under various labels, including Office Depot®, OfficeMax ®, Foray®, Ativa® , TUL®, Realspace® , WorkPro®, Brenton Studio® , Highmark®, and Grand & Toy® . 
 During the fourth quarter of 2017, as part of our announced transformation into a more business services-driven platform, we expanded our offerings to provide more services through a monthly subscription format. As part of this offering, we launched BizBox, a new business services platform. BizBox provides start-ups and small business entrepreneurs with access to the core services needed to start and grow their businesses through a monthly subscription. BizBox core service offerings include website hosting and design, Centriq asset management, digital and social marketing, financing and accounting, customer relationship management and human resources/payroll support. Initially offered through an integrated online platform, the BizBox business services platform was introduced into a select group of our retail stores in 2018. In addition, we offer technical services and support available from CompuCom. 
 We generally classify our offerings into three broad categories: (1) supplies, (2) technology, and (3) furniture and other. The supplies category includes products such as paper, writing instruments, office supplies, cleaning and breakroom items. The technology category includes products such as toner and ink, computers, tablets and accessories, printers, electronic storage, as well as IT services. The furniture and other category includes products such as desks, seating, and luggage, as well as sales in our copy and print centers. Increasingly, we are offering services along with or as part of our product sales.

---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We buy substantially all of our merchandise directly from manufacturers, industry wholesalers, and other primary suppliers, including direct sourcing of our branded products from domestic and offshore sources. We also enter into arrangements with vendors that can lower our unit product costs if certain volume thresholds or other criteria are met. For additional discussion regarding these arrangements, refer to Critical Accounting Policies in Part II  Item 7. MD&A. 
 We operate separate merchandising functions in the United States and Canada. Each group is responsible for selecting, purchasing, managing the product life cycle of our inventory, and managing pricing primarily for retail and direct selling channels. Organizationally, they are aligned under the same Corporate leadership. In recent years, we have increasingly used global offerings across the regions to further reduce our product cost while maintaining product quality. 
 We operate a global sourcing office in Shenzhen, China, which allows us to better manage our product sourcing, logistics and quality assurance. This office consolidates our purchasing power with Asian factories and, in turn, helps us to increase the scope of our own branded offerings. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We regularly assess consumer shopping behaviors to refine our strategy to identify and offer desired product assortment, shopping environment and purchasing methods. Identifying the most desirable and effective way to reach our customers and allowing them to shop through whichever channel they prefer will continue to be a priority in the future. These efforts have impacted the design of our new store concept, the extent, format and vehicles we use to advertise to and reach customers, our web page design, promotions and product offerings. 
 Our marketing programs are designed to attract and retain customers, drive frequency of customer visits, and increase customer spend in our stores and websites. We regularly advertise in major newspapers in most of our North American markets. We also advertise through local and national radio, network and cable television advertising campaigns, and direct marketing efforts, such as the internet and social networking. We have shifted a meaningful amount of our marketing efforts in recent periods to digital programs that enhance personalized offerings and promote customer satisfaction. 
 Our customer loyalty program provides customers with rewards that can be applied to future purchases or other incentives. These programs enable us to market more effectively to our customers and may change as customer preferences shift. 
 We perform periodic competitive pricing analyses to monitor each market, and prices are adjusted as necessary to further our competitive positioning. We generally target our everyday pricing to be competitive with other resellers of office products. 
 Our customer acquisition efforts regularly shift to vehicles and formats found to be most productive for reaching the targeted class of customer. We acquire customers through e-mail and social media campaigns, online affiliate 
 
6 


  connections, on-premises sales calls, outbound sales calls, and catalogs, among others. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total sales or receivables in 2017, 2016 or 2015. 
 Seasonality 
 Our business is somewhat seasonal, with sales generally trending lower in the second quarter, following the back-to-business sales cycle in the first quarter and preceding the back-to-school sales cycle in the third quarter and the holiday sales cycle in the fourth quarter for the Retail and Business Solutions Divisions. The CompuCom Division generally does not experience notable seasonality. Certain working capital components may build and recede during the year reflecting established selling cycles. Business cycles can and have impacted our operations and financial position when compared to other periods. 
Intellectual Property 
 We currently operate under the Office Depot®, OfficeMax®, CompuCom®, Grand & Toy®, as well as other brand names. We hold trademark registrations domestically and worldwide and have numerous other applications pending worldwide for the names Office Depot, Ativa, Foray, Realspace, OfficeMax, TUL, WorkPro, Brenton Studio, Highmark and others. As with all domestic trademarks, our trademark registrations in the United States are for a ten year period and are renewable every ten years, prior to their respective expirations, as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade. We also hold issued patents and pending patent applications domestically for certain private brand products, such as shredders, binders, and writing instruments. 
Industry and Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our Retail and Business Solutions Divisions compete with office supply stores, wholesale clubs, discount stores, mass merchandisers, online retailers, food and drug stores, computer and electronics superstores and direct marketing companies. These companies compete with us in substantially all of our current markets. Increased competition in the office products markets, together with increased advertising, and internet-based search tools, has heightened price awareness among end-users. Such heightened price awareness has led to sales and margin pressure on our sales of office products and has negatively impacted our results. In addition to price, we also compete based on customer service, the quality and extent of product selection and convenience. Other office supply retail companies market similarly to us in terms of store format, pricing strategy, product selection and product availability in the markets where we operate. Some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources, which provide them with greater purchasing power, increased financial flexibility and more capital resources for expansion and improvement, which may enable them to compete more effectively. We anticipate that in the future we will continue to face high levels of competition from these companies. 
 We believe our customer service and the efficiency and convenience for our customers from our combined contract and direct distribution channels help our Business Solutions Division to compete with other business-to-business office products distributors. 
 We believe our Retail Division segment competes based on convenience, location, the quality of our customer service, our store formats, the range and depth of our merchandise offering and our pricing. 
 The CompuCom Division operates in an environment that is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to shifting client needs and expectations. We compete with companies that provide IT services and outsourcing, as well as companies that sell IT related products. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge, a breadth of service offerings to provide one-stop solutions to clients, a well-developed recruiting, training and retention model, responsiveness to clients business needs, and quality of services. We believe our CompuCom Division successfully competes based on the quality of our customer service, the range and depth of our merchandise offering and our pricing.

 Employees 
 As of January 27, 2018, we had approximately 45,000 employees in continuing operations. 
 Environmental Matters 
 As both a significant user and seller of paper products, we have developed environmental practices that are values-based and market-driven. Our environmental initiatives center on three guiding principles: (1) recycling and pollution reduction; (2) sustainable forest management; and (3) issue awareness and market development for environmentally preferable products. We offer thousands of different products containing recycled content and technology recycling services. 
 Office Depot continues to implement environmental programs in line with our stated environmental vision to increasingly buy green, be green and sell green  including environmental sensitivity in our packaging, operations and sales offerings. We have been commended for our leadership position for our facility design, recycling efforts, and green product offerings. Additional information on our green product offerings can be found at www.officedepot.com/buygreen. 
 We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations related to historical OfficeMax operations of paper and forest products businesses and timberland assets. We record environmental and asbestos liabilities, and accrue losses associated with these obligations, when probable and reasonably estimable. We record a separate insurance recovery receivable when considered probable. Refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings for additional information.
