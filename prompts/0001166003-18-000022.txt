ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Overview
XPO Logistics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries (“XPO,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”), is a top ten global provider of cutting-edge supply chain solutions to the most successful companies in the world. The Company operates as a highly integrated network of people, technology and physical assets. We use our network to help our customers manage their goods more efficiently throughout their supply chains. As of December 31, 2017, we served more than 50,000 customers and operated with over 95,000 employees and 1,455 locations in 32 countries. For full year 2017, our global revenue profile was approximately 60% United States, 13% France, 12% United Kingdom, 4% Spain and 11% other geographies, primarily across Europe and Asia.
We run our business on a global basis, with two segments: Transportation and Logistics. Within each segment, we have built robust service offerings that are positioned to capitalize on fast-growing areas of customer demand. Substantially all of our businesses operate under the single brand of XPO Logistics.
Transportation Segment
We offer customers an unmatched network of multiple modes, flexible capacity and route density that transports freight quickly and cost effectively from origin to destination. Our scale is a significant advantage — both for XPO, as a competitive advantage, and for our customers, who depend on us to provide reliable capacity under all market conditions. We are the second largest freight brokerage provider globally, and we hold industry-leading positions in North America and Europe. In North America, we are the largest provider of last mile logistics for heavy goods; the largest manager of expedite shipments; the second largest provider of less-than-truckload (“LTL”) transportation; and the third largest provider of intermodal services, including a national drayage network; as well as a global freight forwarder with a large network of ocean, air, ground and cross-border services.
2

In Europe, we have the largest owned road transportation fleet. We offer full truckload transportation in Europe as dedicated, non-dedicated and brokered services; last mile logistics services; and LTL transportation through one of the largest LTL networks in Western Europe. Our total lane density in Europe covers the regions that produce approximately 90% of the eurozone’s gross domestic product.
Our Transportation segment uses a blended model of owned, contracted and brokered capacity. This gives us the flexibility to provide solutions that best serve the interests of our customers and the Company. As of December 31, 2017, globally, we had approximately 11,000 independent owner operators under contract to provide drayage, expedite, last mile and LTL services to our customers, and more than 50,000 independent brokered carriers representing over 1,000,000 trucks on the road.
We employ professional drivers that transport goods for customers using our fleet of owned and leased trucks and trailers. Globally, our road fleet encompasses approximately 16,000 tractors and 39,000 trailers, primarily related to our LTL and full truckload operations. These assets also provide capacity for our freight brokerage operations as needed. Our company overall is asset-light, with the revenue generated by activities directly associated with our owned assets accounting for just under a third of our revenue in 2017.
Logistics Segment
In our Logistics segment, which we sometimes refer to as supply chain or contract logistics, we provide a range of differentiated and data-intensive services, including highly engineered and customized solutions, value-added warehousing and distribution, cold chain distribution and other inventory management solutions. We perform e-commerce fulfillment, reverse logistics, recycling, storage, factory support, aftermarket support, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and labeling, and a range of customized solutions such as order personalization. In addition, we provide supply chain optimization services such as production flow management and transportation management. Once we secure a logistics contract, the average tenure is approximately five years and the relationship can lead to a wider use of our services, such as inbound and outbound logistics.
Globally, XPO operates approximately 170 million square feet (15.8 million square meters) of contract logistics facility space, making us the second largest contract logistics provider worldwide. Approximately 83.7 million square feet (7.8 million square meters) of that space is in the United States, where we are a market leader in logistics capacity. This expansive, global footprint makes XPO particularly attractive to large customers with multinational operations. Our logistics customers include the preeminent names in retail and e-commerce, food and beverage, technology, aerospace, wireless, industrial and manufacturing, chemical, agribusiness, life sciences and healthcare.
We also benefit from a strong presence in the high-growth e-commerce sector. E-commerce is predicted to continue to grow globally at a double-digit rate through at least 2020 and, increasingly, order fulfillment is being outsourced. Demand in the e-commerce sector is characterized by strong seasonal surges in activity; typically, the fourth quarter peak is the most dramatic, when holiday orders are placed online.
We are the largest outsourced e-fulfillment provider in Europe, and we have a major platform for e-fulfillment in North America, where we provide highly customized solutions that include reverse logistics and omnichannel services. Our experience with fast-growing e-commerce categories such as mobile electronics makes us a valuable partner to our customers in areas such as product returns, testing, refurbishment, warranty management, order personalization and other value-added services. These global capabilities, together with our last mile leadership in heavy goods in North America, provide our e-commerce customers with superior in-house control, flexible warehousing options and labor pools, advanced automation, and a national network of home delivery hubs — shortening the time between sourcing and doorstep and generating industry-leading consumer satisfaction levels.
Operating Philosophy 
We believe that our ability to provide customers with integrated, end-to-end supply chain solutions gives us a competitive advantage. Many customers, particularly large companies, are moving to large, single-source relationships with multi-modal providers to handle their supply chain requirements. We have built XPO to capitalize on this trend, as well as the trend toward outsourcing in transportation and logistics, the boom in e-commerce, and the adoption of just-in-time inventory practices.
Two hallmarks of our operations worldwide are technology and sustainability.
3

We place massive importance on innovation because we believe that great technology in the hands of well-trained employees is the ultimate competitive advantage in our industry. We view our technology as being critical to continuously improving customer service, controlling costs and leveraging our scale. Our annual investment in technology of more than $450 million is among the highest in our industry.
We concentrate our efforts in the following areas of innovation: automation and robotics; big data; visibility and customer service; and digital freight marketplace. We have built a highly scalable and integrated system on a cloud-based platform that speeds up both the development process and the time-to-launch. Our global team of approximately 1,700 technology professionals can deploy proprietary software very rapidly.
Our focus is on developing proprietary innovations that differentiate our services and create tangible value for our customers and investors. For example, we have the ability to share data with our customers in real time, including visibility of orders moving through fulfillment and shipments in transit, on-demand availability of full truckload. Internally, our technology gives us a birds-eye view of real-time market conditions and pricing for truckload, intermodal and LTL, and facilitates load assignments with our independent contractors, all of which greatly enhances customer service.
In addition, XPO has a strong, global commitment to sustainability. We own the largest natural gas truck fleet in Europe, and we launched government-approved mega-trucks in Spain, both of which reduce our carbon footprint. Our Company has been awarded the label “Objectif CO2” for outstanding environmental performance of transport operations in Europe by the French Ministry of the Environment and the French Environment and Energy Agency.
Many of our logistics facilities globally are ISO 14001-certified, which ensures environmental and other regulatory compliances. We monitor fuel emissions from forklifts, with protocols in place to take immediate corrective action if needed. Company packaging engineers ensure that the optimal carton size is used for each product slated for distribution and, as a byproduct of reverse logistics, we recycle millions of electronic components and batteries each year. These are just a few of the many initiatives that reflect our commitment to operating in a progressive and environmentally sound manner, with the greatest efficiency and least waste possible.
Transportation Services
The Company’s Transportation segment includes five service lines: freight brokerage, last mile, LTL, full truckload and global forwarding. These service lines are led by highly experienced operators that know how to deliver results.
Freight Brokerage
Our freight brokerage operations encompass truck brokerage globally, as well as intermodal, drayage and expedite services in North America.
Our truck brokerage operations are non-asset-based: we place shippers’ freight with qualified carriers, primarily trucking companies. Customers offer loads to us via electronic data interchange, email, telephone and the internet on a daily basis. These services are priced on either a spot market or contract basis for shippers. We collect payments from our customers and pay the carriers for transporting customer loads. Our proprietary, cloud-based brokerage platform, Freight Optimizer, gives us real-time visibility into truckload supply and demand.
Our intermodal operations are asset-light: we provide customers with container capacity, brokered rail transportation, drayage transportation via independent contractors, and on-site operational services. We lease or own approximately 10,000 53-ft. containers and 5,000 chassis, and we use this equipment to fill some of our customers’ capacity requirements.
We have sophisticated infrastructure in place to work with the railroads in providing the long-haul portion of freight shipments in containers, and we contract with trucking companies for local pickup and delivery. We also provide customized electronic tracking and analysis of market prices and negotiated rail, truck and intermodal rates through our proprietary intermodal technology, Rail Optimizer, which enables us to determine the optimal configurations.
We offer our door-to-door intermodal services to a wide range of customers in North America, including large industrial and retail shippers, transportation intermediaries such as intermodal marketing companies, and steamship lines. As of December 31, 2017, XPO was the third largest provider of intermodal services in North America, with 
4

one of the largest U.S. drayage networks, and a leading provider of intermodal services in the cross-border Mexico sector.
Our expedite operations are predominantly non-asset-based: substantially all of the ground transportation equipment is provided by third-party truck carriers. In addition, we facilitate expedite air charter service for customer freight using the Company’s relationships with third-party air carriers and our proprietary, web-based sourcing technology.
Our expedite services can be characterized as time-critical, time-sensitive or high priority freight shipments, many of which have special handling needs. Urgent needs for expedited transportation typically arise due to tight tolerances in a customer’s supply chain, or an interruption or a failure in the supply chain. 
Expedite customers most often request our services on a per-load transactional basis through our offices or via our proprietary online portals. Only a small percentage of loads are scheduled for future delivery dates. We operate an ISO 9001:2008-certified call center that gives our customers on-demand status updates related to their expedited shipments. As of December 31, 2017, XPO was the largest manager of expedited freight shipments in North America.
Last Mile Logistics
Our last mile services are predominantly asset-light: we utilize independent contractors to perform transportation and over-the-threshold deliveries and installations. In North America, these services are facilitated through a large network of XPO last mile hubs. As of December 31, 2017, we had 55 hubs operating in North America. By year-end 2018, we expect to grow this network to 85 hubs, extending our footprint to within 90% of the U.S. population and further reducing transit times for our customers.
Last mile comprises the final stage of the delivery from a local distribution center or retail store to the end-consumer’s home or business, where additional services are often required. It is a fast-growing industry sector that serves blue chip retailers, e-commerce companies and smaller retailers with limited in-house capabilities for deliveries and installations. Important aspects of last mile service are responsiveness to seasonal demand, economies of scale and an ability to maintain a consistently high quality of customer experience.
The last mile process often requires incremental services such as pre-scheduled delivery times, unpacking, assembly, utility connection, installation and testing, as well as the removal of an old product. These additional services are commonly referred to as white-glove services. We use our proprietary technology platform to collect customer feedback, monitor carrier performance, manage capacity and communicate during narrow windows of service to ensure consumer satisfaction and protect the brands of our customers.
Our last mile operations in North America and Europe specialize in heavy goods, including appliances, furniture, large electronics and other goods that are larger-than-parcel. As of December 31, 2017, XPO was the largest provider of last mile services for heavy goods in North America.
Less-Than-Truckload (LTL)
In North America, our LTL operations are asset-based: we utilize employee drivers, our own fleet of tractors and trailers for line-haul, pick-up and delivery, and a network of terminals. We provide our customers with critical density and day-definite regional, inter-regional and transcontinental LTL freight services. As of December 31, 2017, XPO was the second largest provider of LTL services in North America, offering more than 75,000 next-day and two-day lanes. Our coverage area in North America encompasses approximately 99% of all U.S. zip codes, with service in Canada.
In Europe, our LTL operations utilize a blend of asset-based and asset-light capacity — both company fleet and contracted carriers, with a network of terminals. We provide LTL services domestically in France, the United Kingdom and Spain. We also offer international LTL distribution throughout Europe.
Full Truckload
Our full truckload operations are asset-based and operate almost entirely in Europe. For many customers, we operate as a dedicated contract carrier, providing truckload capacity by utilizing our fleet of tractors and trailers. In addition, we provide transactional transportation of packaged goods, high cube products and bulk goods. We provide full truckload services domestically in France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Romania, Italy, Portugal and 
5

Slovakia, and internationally throughout Europe. As of December 31, 2017, XPO was a leading provider of full truckload transportation in Europe.
Global Forwarding
Our global forwarding operations are asset-light: we provide logistics services for domestic, cross-border and international shipments through our relationships with ground, air and ocean carriers and a network of Company and agent-owned offices. Our freight forwarding capabilities are not restricted by size, weight, mode or location, and therefore are potentially attractive to a wide market base.
As part of our global forwarding network, we operate a subsidiary as a non-vessel-operating common carrier (“NVOCC”) to transport our customers’ freight by contracting with vessel operators. We are also a customs broker licensed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service. This enables us to provide customs brokerage services to direct domestic importers, other freight forwarders and NVOCCs, and vessel-operating common carriers.
Logistics Services
The Company’s Logistics segment, which we also refer to as supply chain or contract logistics, encompasses a range of services, including highly engineered and customized solutions, temperature-controlled warehousing, omnichannel logistics e-fulfillment and transportation management. The segment is led by seasoned executives in North America and Europe that collaborate on multinational opportunities. As of December 31, 2017, XPO was the second largest global provider of contract logistics based on square footage, with one of the largest e-fulfillment platforms in Europe.
We provide our logistics customers with integrated services such as dedicated and shared warehousing, e-fulfillment order processing and personalization, reverse logistics, storage, factory support, aftermarket support, manufacturing, packaging, labeling and distribution. In addition, we utilize our technology and expertise to solve complex supply chain challenges and create transformative solutions for our customers, while reducing their operating costs and improving production flow management.
Our logistics customers primarily operate in industries with high-growth outsourcing opportunities, such as retail and e-commerce, food and beverage, technology, aerospace, wireless, industrial and manufacturing, chemical, agribusiness, life sciences and healthcare. These customers have demanding requirements for quality standards, real-time data visibility, special handling, security, the management of large numbers of stock-keeping units (“SKUs”), time-assured deliveries and volume fluctuations, with seasonal surges in certain sectors such as retail and e-commerce.
The Company is a top five global provider of managed transportation based on the value of freight under management. Our managed transportation offering includes a range of services provided to shippers who want to outsource some or all of their transportation modes, together with associated activities. These activities can include freight handling such as consolidation and deconsolidation, labor planning, the facilitation of inbound and outbound shipments, cross-border management, claims processing, and third-party supplier management, as well as other services.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to use our highly integrated network of people, technology and physical assets to help customers manage their goods more efficiently throughout their supply chains. We deliver value to customers in the form of cost and risk reductions, process efficiencies, consistently reliable outcomes, technological innovations and customer service that is both highly responsive and proactive.
We continue to optimize our existing operations by growing our sales force, implementing advanced information technology, cross-selling our services and leveraging our Company-wide capacity. In addition, we maintain a disciplined and comprehensive set of processes related to the recruiting, training and mentoring of employees, and for marketing to the hundreds of thousands of prospective customers that can use our services. Most important to our growth, we have instilled a culture of collaboration that focuses our efforts on delivering the results that matter to our customers and the Company.
6

We will continue to grow the business in a disciplined manner, and with a compelling value proposition: XPO can provide integrated, innovative solutions for any company, of any size, with any combination of supply chain needs.

Technology and Intellectual Property
One of the ways in which we empower our employees to deliver superior service is through our information technology. We believe that technology is a compelling differentiator in our industry. Technology represents one of the Company’s largest categories of capital investment, reflecting our belief that the continual enhancement of our cloud-based platform is critical to our success. We have a world-class technology team that focuses on innovating customer service and advancing the effectiveness of our software.
In our Transportation segment, our proprietary Freight Optimizer software for truck brokerage provides dynamic pricing information, automated carrier matching and digital track and trace capabilities. Our DriveXPO mobile application interacts with Freight Optimizer to create a digital brokerage marketplace by automating key brokerage functions for carriers. Carriers use this app to bid on loads and reduce empty miles. It also serves as a geo-locator and supports voice-to-text communications.
Our proprietary Rail Optimizer software manages all aspects of intermodal operations, including shipment tracking, capacity flow and asset management, market-based pricing, and the contracting of transportation services with rail 
7

providers. Rail Optimizer has enabled us to raise intermodal service levels, reduce empty miles and increase visibility across the network.
In expedite, we utilize satellite tracking and communication units on the independently contracted vehicles that transport goods for our customers, thus enabling real-time electronic updates. A significant component of our expedite operations is our proprietary bidding platform, which awards loads electronically based on carriers’ online bids and manages the transportation process almost entirely through technology. 
In last mile logistics, our proprietary, web-based technology has been instrumental in ensuring superior consumer satisfaction ratings by gathering actionable, real-time feedback post-delivery to help our customers build loyalty. In addition, our software supports tighter delivery windows, facilitates complex home installations, and gives consumers digital tools to track their order in real time, set personalized alerts and reschedule delivery times electronically.
In our LTL operations, we rolled out 14,000 handhelds and inspection tablets for drivers and dockworkers to enhance productivity and revenue collection from accessorials and ancillary services. We also developed new RFP and pricing systems for LTL, with robust algorithms and profitability monitoring. These have improved the business intelligence we use for LTL pricing, workforce planning and network optimization.
In our Logistics segment, we have developed proprietary technology for the design and implementation of sophisticated contract logistics solutions for our customers. These solutions are most often utilized by large, multinational and medium-sized corporations and by government agencies with complex supply chain requirements. Our warehouses are becoming high-tech hubs: we have robots working side-by-side with our people, and drones helping out with inventory management. We use smart glasses for order picking, and numerous other technologies, some of which are purpose-built for individual customers.
The logistics space is wide open for the development of exciting technologies. For example, we have developed predictive analytics that use machine learning to forecast demand — we use this information to collaborate with our customers and allocate resources for changes in volumes. By predicting the flow of goods and future returns, we are able to help our customers plan for inventory, capacity and labor levels. These capabilities are particularly valuable to e-commerce customers.
Our position as the industry’s leading champion of technology continues to lead to important new benefits for our customers. In early 2018, we plan to roll out our next-generation, proprietary warehouse management system. This system can dramatically reduce ramp-up time on customer projects. It operates on tablets and other mobile devices and integrates very quickly with other technologies, such as robotics, through a state-of-the-art interface.
XPO relies on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and non-competition agreements to establish and protect its intellectual property and proprietary technology. We have numerous registered trademarks, trade names and logos in the United States and international jurisdictions.
Customers, Sales and Marketing
Our Company provides services to a variety of customers, ranging in size from small, entrepreneurial organizations to Fortune 500 companies and global industry leaders. We have a diversified customer base that minimizes our concentration risk: in 2017, approximately 10% of our revenue was attributable to our top five customers.
Our customers are engaged in a wide range of industries, including retail, e-commerce, food and beverage, manufacturing, technology and telecommunications, aerospace and defense, life sciences, healthcare, medical equipment, and agriculture. In 2017, retail and e-commerce accounted for the largest portion of our global revenue at 29%, compared with 26% in 2016; followed by food and beverage at 16% in 2017, compared with 14% in 2016.
XPO is not reliant on the economy of any one country, region or industry. Our transportation services are primarily marketed in North America and Europe, whereas our logistics and global forwarding networks serve global markets with concentrations in North America, Europe and Asia.
Competition
The transportation and logistics industry is highly competitive, with thousands of companies competing in domestic and international markets. XPO competes on service, reliability, scope and scale of operations, technological 
8

capabilities and price. Our competitors include local, regional, national and international companies that offer the same services we provide — some with larger customer bases, significantly more resources and more experience than we have. In some cases, our customers have internal resources that can handle some of the same services we offer. Due in part to the fragmented nature of the industry, we must strive daily to retain existing business relationships and forge new relationships.
The health of the transportation and logistics industry will continue to be a function of domestic and global economic growth. However, we believe that we have positioned the Company to derive additional benefits from the growth of e-commerce, and from a long-term outsourcing trend that should continue to help a number of our service sectors grow faster than the macro environment.
Regulation
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies in the United States and in the other countries where we conduct business. These regulations impact us directly and indirectly by regulating third-party transportation providers we use to transport freight for our customers.
Regulation Affecting Motor Carriers, Owner Operators and Transportation Brokers. In the United States, our subsidiaries that operate as motor carriers have licenses to operate as motor carriers issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). In addition, our subsidiaries acting as property brokers have property broker licenses issued by the FMCSA. Our motor carrier subsidiaries and the third-party motor carriers we engage in the United States must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug- and alcohol-testing, hours-of-service, records retention, vehicle inspection, driver qualification and minimum insurance requirements. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to government regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to emissions, drivers’ hours-of-service, independent contractor eligibility requirements, onboard reporting of operations, air cargo security and other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the California Air Resources Board, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), also regulate our equipment, operations and independent contractor drivers. Like our third-party support carriers, we are also subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements in various states and local jurisdictions where we operate. In other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, our operations are regulated, where necessary, by the appropriate governmental authorities.
In 2010, the FMCSA introduced the Compliance Safety Accountability program (“CSA”), which uses a Safety Management System (“SMS”) to rank motor carriers on seven categories of safety-related data, known as Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories, or “BASICs,” which data, it is anticipated, will eventually be used for determining a carrier’s DOT safety rating under revisions to existing Safety Fitness Determination (“SFD”) regulations. In December 2015, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (“FAST Act”) was signed into law, and requires the FMCSA to review the CSA program to ensure that it provides the most reliable analysis possible. During this review period, the FAST Act requires the FMCSA to remove a property carrier’s CSA scores from public view.
Although the CSA scores are not currently publicly available, this development is likely to be temporary. As a result, once the program has been revamped, our fleet could be ranked worse or better than our competitors, and the safety ratings of our motor carrier operations could be impacted. Our network of third-party transportation providers may experience a similar result. A reduction in safety and fitness ratings may result in difficulty attracting and retaining qualified independent contractors and could cause our customers to direct their business away from XPO and to carriers with more favorable CSA scores, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
In the past, the subsidiaries through which we operate our expedited and intermodal drayage operations have exceeded the established intervention threshold in certain of the BASICs, and we may exceed those thresholds in the future. Depending on our ratings, we may be prioritized for an intervention action or roadside inspection, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations, or customers may be less likely to assign loads to us. We cannot predict the extent to which CSA requirements or safety and fitness ratings under SMS or SFD could adversely affect our business, operations or ability to retain compliant drivers, or those of our subsidiaries, independent contractors or third-party transportation providers.
9

New regulations effective December 2017 require nearly all carriers and drivers that are required to maintain records of duty status, including certain of XPO’s motor carrier subsidiaries and drivers, to install and use electronic logging devices (“ELDs”). ELD installation and use may increase costs for independent contractors and other third-party support carriers who provide services to XPO, and may impact driver recruitment.
Regulations Affecting our Subsidiaries Providing Ocean and Air Transportation. XPO Customs Clearance Solutions, Inc. (“XCCS”) and XPO GF America, Inc. (“XGFA”), two of the Company’s subsidiaries, are licensed as customs brokers by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) of DHS in each United States customs district in which they do business. All United States customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by CBP. In other jurisdictions in which we perform customs brokerage services, our operations are licensed, where necessary, by the appropriate governmental authority.
Our subsidiaries offering expedited air charter transportation are subject to regulation by the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) of DHS regarding air cargo security for all loads, regardless of origin and destination. XPO Global Forwarding, Inc. (“XGF”), XGFA and XPO Air Charter also are regulated as “indirect air carriers” by the DHS and TSA. These agencies provide requirements, guidance and, in some cases, administer licensing requirements and processes applicable to the freight forwarding industry. We must actively monitor our compliance with such agency requirements to ensure that we have satisfactorily completed the security requirements and qualifications and implemented the required policies and procedures. These agencies generally require companies to fulfill these qualifications prior to transacting various types of business. Failure to do so could result in penalties and fines. The air cargo industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative actions that could affect economic conditions within the industry by requiring changes to operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing services to customers. We cannot predict the extent to which any such regulatory or legislative actions could adversely affect our business, but we strive to comply with all agency requirements.
Regarding our international operations, XGF, XGFA and XCCS are members of the International Air Transportation Association (“IATA”), a voluntary association of airlines and freight forwarders that outlines operating procedures for forwarders acting as agents or third-party intermediaries for IATA members. A substantial portion of XPO’s international air freight business is transacted with other IATA members.
Additionally, XGF, XGFA and XPO Ocean Lines, Inc. (“XOL”) are each registered as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary (“OTI”) by the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”), which establishes the qualifications, regulations and bonding requirements to operate as an OTI for businesses originating and terminating in the United States. XGL and XOL are also licensed NVOCCs and ocean freight forwarders.
Our international freight forwarding operations make us subject to regulations of the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Treasury, and to various laws and regulations of the other countries where we operate. These regulations cover matters such as what commodities may be shipped to what destinations and to what end-users, unfair international trade practices, and limitations on entities with which we may conduct business.
Other Regulations. The Company is subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption statutes.
Classification of Independent Contractors. Tax and other federal and state regulatory authorities, as well as private litigants, continue to assert that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements and heighten the penalties for companies who misclassify workers and are found to have violated overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers that meet certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a longstanding, recognized practice. Federal legislators also sought to expand the Fair Labor Standards Act to cover “non-employees” who perform labor or services for businesses, even if the “non-employees” are properly classified as independent contractors; require taxpayers to provide written notice to workers based upon their classification as either an “employee” or a “non-employee”; and impose penalties and fines for violations of the notice requirements or “employee” or “non-employee” misclassifications. Some states have launched initiatives to increase revenues from items such as unemployment, workers’ compensation and income taxes, and the reclassification of independent 
10

contractors as employees could help states with those initiatives. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determinations of independent contractor status. If XPO’s independent contractor drivers are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under some or all of the following: federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, and labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.
Environmental Regulations. Our facilities and operations and our independent contractors are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, emissions from vehicles, engine-idling, fuel tanks and related fuel spillage and seepage, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters that involve inherent environmental risks. Similar laws and regulations may apply in many of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We may be responsible for the cleanup of any spill or other incident involving hazardous materials caused by our operations or business. In the past, we have been responsible for the costs of cleanup of diesel fuel spills caused by traffic accidents or other events, and none of these incidents materially affected our business or operations. We generally transport only hazardous materials rated as low-to-medium-risk, and a small percentage of our total shipments contain hazardous materials. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations and we do not know of any existing environmental condition that reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. We also do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls in 2018. Future changes in environmental regulations or liabilities from newly discovered environmental conditions or violations (and any associated fines and penalties) could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. U.S. federal and state governments, as well as governments in certain foreign jurisdictions where we operate, have also proposed environmental legislation that could, among other things, potentially limit carbon, exhaust and greenhouse gas emissions. If enacted, such legislation could result in higher new tractor and trailer costs, reduced productivity and efficiency, and increased operating expenses, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Risk Management and Insurance
We maintain insurance for commercial automobile liability, truckers’ commercial automobile liability, commercial general liability, cargo/warehouse legal liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, and umbrella and excess umbrella liability, with coverage limits, deductibles and self-insured retention levels that we believe are reasonable given the varying historical frequency, severity and timing of claims. Certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments are made for insurance reserves and are subject to a high degree of variability.
Seasonality
Our revenue and profitability are typically lower for the first quarter of the calendar year relative to the other quarters. We believe this is due in part to the post-holiday reduction in demand experienced by many of our customers, which leads to more capacity in the non-expedited and service-critical markets and, in turn, less demand for expedited and premium shipping services. In addition, the productivity of our tractors and trailers, independent contractors and transportation providers generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations. It is not possible to predict whether the Company’s historical revenue and profitability trends will continue to occur in future periods.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 95,000 full-time and part-time employees. Our employee base is one of our most critical resources, and we view the recruitment, training and retention of qualified employees as being essential to our ongoing success. We believe that we have good relations with our employees, with strong programs in place for communication and professional development.
