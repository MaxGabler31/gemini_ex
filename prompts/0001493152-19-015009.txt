ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview of Business
 
We are an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) of high-performance vehicles (“Saleen OEM”) that we build from the ground up. We also design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance vehicles built from base chassis of major American automobile manufacturers, which we refer to as “Saleen Signature Cars”. We currently have customers worldwide, including muscle and high-performance car enthusiasts, collectors, automotive dealers, exotic car retail dealers, television and motion picture productions, and consumers in the luxury supercar and motorsports markets. We also provide engineering, development and design consulting services on a project basis for automotive manufacturers worldwide.
 
Saleen OEM
 
We manufacture the recently redesigned Saleen S7 supercar (“S7”), a limited production supercar with a 1,500-horsepower engine on E85 fuel, in our production facility in Corona, California. We are also planning to develop a new American supercar. The term supercar describes an expensive (approximately $250,000 or more), limited production, fast or powerful (capable of reaching speeds in excess of 180 miles per hour) sports car with a centrally located engine.
 
We are in the process of completing the engineering, design, and certification of a new high-performance sports car, the Saleen 1 (“S1”), under an engineering development and design contract with an unaffiliated corporation located in China which holds the intellectual property rights related to the S1 developed under the agreement. Terms for the manufacture and sale of the S1 remain subject to further negotiation and agreement. A high-performance car is an automobile that is designed and constructed specifically for speed. The design and construction of a high-performance car involve not only providing a capable power train but also providing the handling and braking systems to support it.
 
Saleen Signature Cars
 
Our Saleen Signature Cars are built from base chassis of major American automobile manufacturers, including Ford Mustangs, Tesla Model S vehicles, and Ford trucks. We are a specialist in vehicle design, engineering, and manufacturing focusing on the mass customization (the process of customizing automobiles that are mass-produced by manufacturers) of American sports and electric vehicles and the production of high-performance USA-engineered sports cars. Saleen-branded products include a line of high performance and upgraded muscle and electric cars, automotive aftermarket specialty parts and lifestyle accessories. Muscle cars are any of a group of American-made 2-door sports coupes with powerful engines designed for high performance driving. Our main retail outlets for Saleen Signature Cars are authorized Ford and exotic car dealers.
Global Markets
 
We plan to operate as a global high-performance automotive brand and expand our production, sales and marketing operations extensively within the markets of the USA and into multiple international markets. In addition, we market our expertise in specialized engineering and design services to third party clients, including major automotive manufacturers and movie producers. Our long-term plans include opening our own retail outlets across the United States. Based on current sales of supercars, we believe that there is a growing global market for dependable, American-made supercars offering demonstrably superior performance with revolutionary styling and design characteristics.

Saleen Automotive, Inc. (together with our subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “our” and “our company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 24, 2011. We began to engage in our current business following a reverse merger we completed in May 2012 with entities controlled by Steve Saleen, a former professional race car driver who has been engaged in the high-performance car business since 1983. Steve used his business degree from the University of Southern California, coupled with experience in his father’s manufacturing business and as a race car driver, to build the Saleen brand. In August 2018, Steve Saleen was presented with the Legends of Auto Award at a ceremony held in Monterey, CA. Previous recipients of the Legends of Auto Award include such automotive luminaries as Lee Iacocca, Jay Leno, Roger Penske, and the late Carroll Shelby.
 
Recapitalization and Reverse Split
 
During the year ended March 31, 2018, we eliminated in excess of $8,549,000 of debt from our balance sheets in a series of transactions by issuing shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock with identical terms (collectively, “Series A Preferred Stock”) in exchange for such debt. All outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock ultimately converted to 12,028,000 shares of our common stock in December 2017, when we effected a 1-for-2,000 reverse stock split of our common stock following approval by our Board of Directors and stockholders. All common stock share and per-share amounts for all periods presented in this annual report have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reverse stock split.
Our Vehicles, Products, and Services
 
We currently provide or intend to provide the following products and services:
 
Saleen OEM: We manufacture the recently redesigned S7 supercar, a limited production supercar with a 1,500-horsepower engine, in our production facility in Corona, California. A total of seven S7 vehicles are expected to be produced, of which one has been sold to date. In addition to the S7, we are in the process of completing the engineering, design, and certification of the S1 high performance car, which has a 450-horsepower engine and an expected base selling price of $100,000.
 
Saleen Signature Cars: We take American sports cars and transform them into Saleen-branded performance vehicles through a process in which every part we incorporate into the vehicle is designed, engineered, tooled, tested, manufactured and certified by us or under our control. We are currently building Saleen Signature Cars utilizing Ford Mustangs and Ford Trucks. The current product line of high performance Saleen Signature Cars includes the Saleen 302 Mustang, Saleen Sport Truck and Saleen Off-Road Truck, which are offered as three different models – White, Yellow and Black Labels. We do not require approval from the original manufacturer in order to transform them into Saleen-branded performance vehicles.
 
Saleen Tesla: We designed, engineered, tooled, tested, and manufactured performance improvement parts designed to incorporate and enhance the performance and design of an existing Tesla Model S car. The Saleen Tesla design is our first effort in enhancing and modifying the design of an existing electric vehicle. Similar to our Saleen line of high-performance vehicles, we improve the performance of the Tesla Model S car primarily through improved aerodynamics, modifications to the body and interior, enhanced braking capabilities, and enhanced suspension changes that improve the overall handling of the vehicle. We take new Tesla Model S vehicles and enhance them with Saleen proprietary designed and manufactured product enhancements. We also sell our designed Saleen Tesla parts as aftermarket parts. We do not require approval from Tesla for these modifications.

Vehicle Limited Warranty Policy
 
We provide a three-year or 36,000 miles New Vehicle Limited Warranty for our Signature Cars, and a 12-month or 12,000-mile warranty on our S7 supercars. The vehicle limited warranty applies to installed parts and/or assemblies in new Saleen high performance cars. All of the unaltered parts are covered under the original full warranty of the OEM manufacturer of the base vehicles (Ford and Tesla).
Supply Chain
 
We use over 1,000 purchased parts, which we source globally from over 100 suppliers, many of whom are currently our single source suppliers for these components. We have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of body components and certain other key system parts. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. We are currently expanding our supplier sources to reduce the risk of a single source supplier adversely affecting our operations. To date, we have expanded from one to two suppliers, the sources from which we obtain some of our automobile body components. We will continue our efforts to reduce our dependence on single source suppliers.
Sales and Marketing Strategy
 
Our principal marketing goals are to:
 

● | generate demand for our vehicles and drive leads to our sales teams; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | build long-term brand awareness and manage corporate reputation; 
● | manage our existing customer base to create loyalty and customer referrals; and 
● | enable customer input into the product development process. 

 
Saleen OEM: We intend to establish Saleen stand-alone dealerships to further promote and sell our supercars, as well as the S1.
 
Saleen Signature Cars: Our Saleen-branded high-performance Signature Cars are sold through Ford retail dealers and exotic automobile dealers. We currently have arrangements with over 40 dealers located throughout the United States and are growing our dealer distribution network. Our dealer agreements provide for an exclusive dealer marketing area in which the applicable dealer can promote our products based on our current product price list. The key terms of our dealer agreements include (a) target dealer product sales goals, (b) exclusive dealer marketing territories and (c) a one-year term, renewable annually. Our agreements may be terminated if our dealers fail to meet our target dealer product sales goals. Our dealer territories are generally based on the local dealers’ county geographical boundaries; however, we may have multiple dealers in densely populated counties such as Los Angeles or San Francisco. Our dealers earn a markup on the sale of our products at the time that the sale is completed upon delivery of the vehicle.
 
Our annual operating budget includes a commitment to effective marketing, advertising and promotional efforts in order to further strengthen awareness of our brand and expose our products to a larger audience. To the extent we obtain sufficient funding, we expect to contract with marketing and advertising businesses with experience marketing and promoting specialty automotive brands to further promote our business. Our marketing plans and efforts include the following:
 
Social Media and Team Saleen: We actively promote our vehicles and our brand through social media including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and online forums linked to Saleen.com. In addition, we recently introduced Team Saleen, an online club for Saleen enthusiasts. Team Saleen provides paid members with exclusive access to the latest developments at Saleen Automotive, message boards moderated by Saleen executives, pictures and articles, new vehicle launches, and live streaming from many of our car shows and events. Several hundred members have signed up in just the first month of Team Saleen. In addition, there are several Saleen fan sites, user groups and forums online accessed by thousands of Saleen enthusiasts worldwide.

Events Marketing: As a high-performance specialty manufacturer, we take pride in attending events on the international auto show circuit such as in Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, New York, Pebble Beach, Shanghai and Beijing. We also participate in regional car shows and our participation in each event includes securing a trade booth to display our products, holding press events to announce new models, and networking with attendees and dealers at the shows.
 
Print Marketing: Our print marketing strategy includes purchasing of ad space targeted to our customer base as well as free press through press releases of newsworthy or entertainment-worthy information. The estimated costs of purchased ad space will vary by target market. We generally purchase ad space at car show venues from time to time as we determine and in keeping with our marketing budget in cities where our dealers are actively engaged in promoting our vehicles.
 
Regulation—Vehicle Safety and Testing
 
Our Saleen branded vehicles are subject to, and we comply with or are exempt from, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), including all applicable United States federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS). Our high performance Saleen branded muscle cars fully comply with all FMVSS without the need for any exemptions. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that a vehicle meets, or otherwise obtain an exemption from, all applicable FMVSS before the vehicle can be sold in the United States.
 
We are also required to comply with other requirements of federal laws administered by the NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner’s manual requirements.
 
The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment, and pricing. In addition, the Act allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings, as determined by the EPA, as well as crash-test ratings, as determined by the NHTSA, if such tests are conducted.
 
Regulation—EPA Emissions & Certificate of Conformity; Internet Sales
 
The Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) with respect to emissions for our vehicles. The Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and both the Certificate of Conformity and the Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California are set by the CARB. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by the EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles.
 
We plan to sell our vehicles over the internet in the future to the extent we determine compliance with applicable governmental regulations will not be unduly burdensome. Some states have laws providing that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a resident of such state except through a dealer licensed to do business in that state. We will, therefore, be required to either obtain a dealer license in such states, partner with a licensed dealer or obtain an exemption from such requirements in connection with sales of our vehicles over the Internet. We have not commenced the process to obtain a dealer license in states requiring such licenses, and are currently determining our strategy with respect to sales of our vehicles in such states and over the internet.
 
In addition, some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state, which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the Internet to residents of the state. In the event that such regulations are applicable to vehicles sold over the Internet, we will be limited in our ability to sell vehicles in such states to the extent that we do not have qualifying service facilities.

The foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we face as we sell our vehicles. In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to Internet sales is largely without precedent, and would be determined by a fact-specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact-specific and untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, state legal prohibitions may prevent us from selling to consumers in such state.
 
Competition
 
Domestic United States auto sales declined slightly to 17.3 million vehicles sold in 2018, after reaching their highest level ever in 2016 with sales of 17.6 million vehicles, following seven consecutive years of year-over-year gains for the automobile industry.
 
Competition in this industry is in most cases based on reputation, prestige, quality, service and overall price. A strong combination of all these areas tends to attract repeat and loyal customers and enthusiast. Consumers tend to shop for name brand and expect high customer service levels. Promptness of service also matters because customers want and need their cars back as soon as possible.
 
In addition to customer service, name or brand recognition and reputation play an important role in determining how competitive an auto customization business is.
 
Our primary competition comes from other high-end cars, their manufacturing companies, and third-party companies that specialize in customization for these cars. These companies include Acura, Aston Martin, Audi, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Lexus, McLaren, and Porsche.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. Saleen Automotive owns trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
 
We currently market our products using the Saleen name and logo, as well as the name and likeness of Steve Saleen, through a royalty free license from Steve Saleen. We have a license agreement with Mr. Saleen to use Steve Saleen’s image, signature, full name, voice, biographical materials, likeness, and the goodwill associated with the “Saleen” brand in connection with our business. The aforementioned license may only be terminated in the event we file a petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or a petition for relief is converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales of our high-performance cars have fluctuated on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters. In general, automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales may have similar seasonality. To address the seasonality of our high-performance cars, we introduced a Saleen-branded truck based on the Ford F-150 in March 2018. Trucks historically sell well in the fall and winter months and the Saleen truck could help offset the seasonal fluctuation in sales of our high-performance vehicles.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, we had 37 employees all of whom were full-time employees. Since inception, we have never had a work stoppage, and our employees are not represented by labor unions. We consider our relationship with our employees to be positive.
Description of Property
 
Our principal executive office is located at 2735 Wardlow Road, Corona, California 92882. Our principal engineering office is located across from our executive office at 2755 Wardlow Road, Corona, California 92882. We operate out of leased facilities comprised of a two-building campus that constitutes approximately four acres of industrial and office space. We believe our facilities are adequate to meet our current and near-term needs.
