Item 1. BUSINESS
United States Steel Corporation (U. S. Steel) is an integrated steel producer of flat-rolled and tubular products with major production operations in the United States and Europe. An integrated steel producer uses iron ore and coke as primary raw materials for steel production. U. S. Steel has annual raw steel production capability of 22.0 million net tons (17.0 million tons in the United States and 5.0 million tons in Europe). U. S. Steel supplies customers throughout the world primarily in the automotive, consumer, industrial and oil country tubular goods (OCTG) markets. According to World Steel Association’s latest published statistics, in 2016 U. S. Steel was the third largest steel producer in the United States and the twenty-fourth largest steel producer in the world. U. S. Steel is also engaged in other business activities consisting primarily of railroad services and real estate operations. 
Segments
U. S. Steel has three reportable operating segments: Flat-Rolled Products (Flat-Rolled), U. S. Steel Europe (USSE) and Tubular Products (Tubular). The results of our railroad and real estate businesses that do not constitute reportable segments are combined and disclosed in the Other Businesses category.
Flat-Rolled
The Flat-Rolled segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel’s integrated steel plants and equity investees in North America involved in the production of slabs, strip mill plates, sheets and tin mill products, as well as all iron ore and coke production facilities in the United States. These operations primarily serve North American customers in the service center, conversion, transportation (including automotive), construction, container, and appliance and electrical markets. 
The Flat-Rolled segment is structured to specifically address customer needs through three "commercial entities." Our Flat-Rolled segment commercial entities are focused on customers in the: (1) automotive, (2) consumer and (3) industrial, service center and mining industries. 
Automotive Solutions collaborates with customers to develop solutions such as the next generation of advanced high strength steel (AHSS) to address challenges facing the automotive industry, including increased fuel economy standards and enhanced safety requirements.
Consumer Solutions partners with customers in the appliance, packaging, container and construction markets. Consumer Solutions has a robust presence with our tin customers, who represent roughly one quarter of this market category. Additional product lines within the market category include the Company's COR-TEN AZP®, ACRYLUME®, GALVALUME® and Weathered Metals Series®.
Industrial, Service Center and Mining Solutions focuses on the Company's customers in the service center business, pipe and tube manufacturing markets, and agricultural and industrial equipment markets.
Flat-Rolled has aggregate annual raw steel production capability of 17.0 million tons produced at our Gary Works, Mon Valley Works, Great Lakes Works and Granite City Works facilities. Prior to the permanent shut down of the Fairfield Flat-Rolled operations beginning in August 2015, annual raw steel production capability for Flat-Rolled was 19.4 million tons. Raw steel production was 10.8 million tons in 2017, 10.7 million tons in 2016 and 11.3 million tons in 2015. Raw steel production averaged 64 percent of capability in 2017, 63 percent of capability in 2016 and 60 percent of capability in 2015. In December 2015 Granite City Works was temporarily idled and if its production capability is excluded, Flat-Rolled production would have been 76 percent and 75 percent of capability in 2017 and 2016 respectively.
European Operations
The USSE segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel Košice (USSK), U. S. Steel’s integrated steel plant and coke production facilities in Slovakia, and its subsidiaries. USSE primarily serves customers in the Eastern European construction, service center, conversion, container, transportation (including automotive), appliance and electrical, and oil, gas and petrochemical markets. USSE produces and sells slabs, sheet, strip mill plate, tin mill products and spiral welded pipe, as well as heating radiators and refractory ceramic materials.

Business Strategy
We are committed to improving our operations, revitalizing our assets, and developing our talent. Foundational to all our efforts is our belief that we must operate as a principled company committed to a code of conduct that is rooted in our Gary Principles and our core values, the most important of which is safety - of our employees, our environment, and our facilities and equipment. This core belief has served us well for much of our history, and our commitment to it remains as strong as the products we make every day. 
We are focused on execution of our two-phased stockholder value creation strategy: (1) earn the right to grow, and (2) drive and sustain profitable growth. Earning the right to grow means delivering consistent, reliable EBITDA across the business cycle by achieving operational excellence through a focused effort by our talented workforce to deliver superior results in four business-critical areas: safety, quality, delivery, and cost. Driving and sustaining profitable growth, economic profit across the business cycle and above-average returns for long-term stockholders, is enabled through stable, reliable facilities that produce innovative product and service solutions for discerning steel customers. Underlying both phases is our unwavering commitment to strengthen our balance sheet, with an emphasis on cash flow, liquidity, and financial flexibility. 
We are on a mission to become an industry leader by striving to create a sustainable competitive advantage with a customer-centric focus on: delivering high-quality, value-added products on time every time; collaborating with customers to develop innovative solutions that address their most challenging needs, including new advanced high-strength steels to meet fuel efficiency and safety requirements for automotive customers and new premium connections that provide strong, durable connections between pipes used by energy customers in oil and gas drilling; generating economic profit through active participation in relevant markets; and creating and maintaining a competitive cost structure centered around operational flexibility. The strategic positioning of operations within the commercial entities enhances our ability to better hear the voice of the customer, ensuring that we deliver superior value and drive results in the markets we choose to serve.
U. S. Steel will continue to evaluate potential strategic and organizational opportunities, which may include the acquisition, divestiture or consolidation of assets. Given recent market conditions, the cyclicality of our industry, and the continued challenges faced by the Company, we are focused on strategically maintaining and spending cash (including capital investments under our asset revitalization program), in order to invest in areas consistent with our long-term strategy, and are considering various possibilities, including exiting lines of business and the sale of certain assets, that we believe would ultimately result in a stronger balance sheet and greater stockholder value. The Company will pursue opportunities based on its long-term strategy, and what the Board of Directors determines to be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders at the time.
Changes to Operational Footprint
On December 22, 2017, a subsidiary of U. S. Steel completed the sale of its 50% ownership interest in Apolo Tubulars, S.A. joint venture for $11 million. As a result of the transaction, U. S. Steel recognized a non-cash loss of approximately $18 million.
On September 29, 2017, a subsidiary of U. S. Steel completed the sale of its 15% ownership interest in Tilden Mining Company L.C. for $105 million. As a result of the transaction, U. S. Steel recognized a gain of approximately $26 million.
On June 30, 2017, U. S. Steel completed the restructuring and disposition of USSC through a sale and transfer of all of the issued and outstanding shares in USSC to an affiliate of Bedrock Industries Group LLC (Bedrock). In accordance with the Second Amended and Restated Plan of Compromise, Arrangement and Reorganization, approved by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on June 9, 2017, U. S. Steel received approximately $127 million in satisfaction of its secured claims, including interest, which resulted in a gain of $72 million on the Company's retained interest in USSC. U. S. Steel also agreed to the discharge and cancellation of its unsecured claims for nominal consideration. The terms of the settlement also included mutual releases among key stakeholders, including a release of all claims against the Company regarding environmental, pension and other liabilities.
In March 2017, U. S. Steel made a strategic decision to permanently shutdown the Lorain No. 6 Quench & Temper Mill and relocate the equipment.
22

In February 2017, the Company restarted production on the hot strip mill at Granite City Works to provide better alignment with customer needs and improve service while increasing the pace of our asset revitalization program. The hot strip mill had been temporarily idle since January 2016.
In December 2016, the Company reached agreements to supply iron ore pellets to third party customers over the next several years. The Keetac Iron Ore Operations restarted production in the first quarter of 2017 to take full advantage of these business opportunities. It had previously been idle since May 2015 due to significantly lower steel production. 
In December 2016, the Company made the strategic decision to permanently close the Lorain #4 and Lone Star #1 pipe mills and the Bellville Tubular Operations after considering a number of factors, including challenging market conditions for tubular products, reduced rig counts, and high levels of unfairly traded imports.
In April 2016, U. S. Steel temporarily idled its Lone Star tubular operations. These operations were restarted in April 2017.
During 2015, the Company adjusted operating levels at several of its tubular operations as declining oil prices and rig counts have significantly reduced demand for OCTG products. 
In August 2015, U. S. Steel permanently shut down most of the Fairfield Flat-Rolled operations.
In 2015, the Company permanently closed the coke making operations at Granite City Works and Gary Works. Also, in 2015, U. S. Steel temporarily idled steelmaking operations at Granite City Works.
Steel Innovation
In addition to the increased focus on our operations, we are continuing to develop the next generation of steel products for our customers. Our Generation 3 (GEN3) steels will provide superior formability and high-strength properties while using a low-alloyed approach for robust weldability. To expand our capabilities in GEN3 steels, a new continuous galvanizing line will be constructed at our PRO-TEC Coating Company joint venture (PRO-TEC), which will allow PRO-TEC to produce these GEN3 steels with a hot-dipped zinc coating. This line will be the first of its kind and will utilize proprietary technology capable of producing the high-quality, cutting-edge advanced high-strength steels that will meet our automotive customers’ needs and solve some of their most pressing challenges. Our GEN3 steels reinforce why steel will remain the lowest cost, strongest, safest, and most environmentally efficient material of choice.
Asset Revitalization 
Our Flat-Rolled segment asset revitalization program is a comprehensive $2 billion investment plan with a focus on continually improving safety, quality, delivery and cost. We currently expect capital spending for this program to be approximately $1.5 billion from 2017 through 2020. As we revitalize our assets, we expect to increase profitability, productivity and operational stability, and reduce volatility. This program is designed to prioritize investment in the areas with the highest returns. Importantly, while this is a large program, the majority of projects are not complex projects. This means that projects are easier to execute. Due to the smaller nature of many of the projects, we do not have to complete the entire program in order to start seeing benefits. Also, by breaking the program down into a series of smaller projects, we have greater flexibility to adjust the scope and pace of project implementation based on changes in business conditions. Our asset revitalization program covers investments in our existing assets and involves investments beyond routine capital and maintenance spending. These projects are expected to deliver both operational and commercial benefits, with most of the benefits coming from operational improvements. The commercial benefits we expect to realize will be driven primarily by things we can control, such as better product quality, improved delivery performance, and increased throughput on constrained assets. Being regarded as a top quartile performer in the eyes of our customers will support sustainable commercial benefits from these investments. After we complete our full asset revitalization program, we expect to have well maintained facilities with a strong core infrastructure, and strong reliability centered maintenance organizations. We will deliver products to our customers with improved reliability and quality. While this program only covers our existing assets, it will create a stable foundation for our future as we continue to evaluate strategic growth projects to strengthen our position as the markets we serve continue to grow and evolve. Refer to our Flat-Rolled segment Asset Revitalization Program Performance Scorecard on page 11 in the 10-K summary section of this document for how we measure success in this program.

Safety 
U. S. Steel has a long-standing commitment to the safety and health of the men and women who work in our facilities. For our Company, safety is our primary core value. Every employee has the right to return home safely at the end of every day, and we are working to eliminate all injuries and incidents at all of our facilities. Ensuring a safe workplace also improves productivity, quality, reliability and financial performance. By making safety and health a personal responsibility, our employees are making a daily commitment to follow safe work practices, look out for the safety of co-workers and ensure safe working conditions for everyone. A “Safety First” mindset is as essential to our success as the tools and technologies we rely on to do business.
Our objective is to attain a sustainable zero harm culture supported by leadership and owned by an engaged and highly skilled workforce, empowered with the capabilities and resources needed to assess, reduce, and eliminate workplace risks and hazards. In support of these objectives, we have developed an enhanced Safety Management System, initiated new safety communication methods and enhanced contractor safety processes.
U. S. Steel finished 2017 with a Global Total OSHA Recordable Rate of 1.04, which is 60% better than the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Iron & Steel rate of 2.60 and 32% better than American Iron and Steel Institute rate of 1.54.  U. S. Steel finished 2017 with a Days Away From Work Rate of 0.17, which is 76% better than the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Iron & Steel rate of 0.70 and 43% better than American Iron and Steel Institute rate of 0.30. Additionally, when comparing our most severe injuries - cases involving 31 or more days away from work - U. S. Steel performs at a level almost 7 times better than the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Iron and Steel. 
In 2017 we experienced one domestic employee fatality and three contractor fatalities (one in the United States and two in Europe). These tragic events serve as a reminder that we must remain vigilant in our safety efforts to ensure every employee and contractor returns home safely every day. 
Through 2017, the 13 year performance for our key safety measures: Total Recordable Incidence and Days Away From Work rates show improvement of 34% and 51% respectively, as shown on the following graphs.

Environmental Stewardship
U. S. Steel is committed to effective environmental stewardship. We have implemented and continue to develop business practices that are environmentally effective. We believe part of being a good corporate citizen requires a dedicated focus on how our industry affects the environment. U. S. Steel's environmental expenditures totaled $255 million in 2017, $232 million in 2016 and $354 million in 2015. For further information, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Environmental Matters.” We have taken the actions described below in furtherance of that goal. 
U. S. Steel, largely through the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), World Steel Association and the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries (Eurofer), is involved in the promotion of cost effective environmental strategies through the development of appropriate air, water, waste and climate change laws and regulations at the local, state, national and international levels.
We are committed to reducing emissions as well as our carbon footprint. We have investigated, created and implemented innovative, best practice solutions throughout U. S. Steel to manage and reduce energy consumption. We are also committed to investing in technologies to further improve the environmental performance of our steelmaking process. In addition, we continue to focus on implementing energy reduction strategies, use of efficient energy sources, waste reduction management and the utilization of by-product fuels.
According to the AISI, relative to competing materials, steel has approximately one-fifth the carbon footprint of aluminum, one-twelfth the footprint of magnesium, and one-ninth the footprint of carbon fiber composites. Our advanced high strength steel (AHSS) used in today’s vehicles afford significant light-weighting opportunities that assist the automobile industry in meeting ever-increasing fuel economy standards while enhancing a vehicle's safety and engine performance. When comparing steel to aluminum, in terms of sustainability, steel has a smaller carbon footprint and costs less.
In 2017 alone, U. S. Steel recycled 2.9 million tons of purchased and produced steel scrap. Because of steel’s physical properties, our products can be recycled at the end of their useful life without loss of quality, contributing to steel’s high recycling rate and affordability. Comparatively, due to limitations in aluminum processing, very little recycled aluminum is included in aluminum sheet goods used for automotive or aircraft applications. This means that any increased use of aluminum sheet for high-end applications must come from Greenhouse Gas (GHG) intensive primary aluminum, which generates significantly more GHG emissions than steel.
U. S. Steel also completed a project to utilize biomass from Clairton Works biological wastewater treatment facility to “seed” other biological wastewater treatment facilities in Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Illinois in 2017. This helps these facilities recover from treatment facility upsets, thereby reducing the amount of pollutants released during the upsets.
In December 2017, U. S. Steel enhanced our website disclosures of GHG emission and energy efficiency projects.
Many of our major production facilities have Environmental Management Systems that are certified to the ISO 14001 Standard. This standard, published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), provides the framework for the measurement and improvement of environmental impacts of the certified facility.
Commercial Strategy
Our commercial strategy is focused on providing customer focused solutions with value-added steel products, including maintaining AHSS leadership with GEN3 steels and coated sheets for the automotive and appliance industries, electrical steel sheets for the manufacture of motors and electrical equipment, galvanized and Galvalume® sheets for construction, hot rolled skelp used in the production of energy transmitting line pipe, tin mill products for the packaging industry and pipe, connections, accessories and rig site services for use in drilling for oil and gas. 
We are responsive to our customers' changing needs by developing new steel products and uses for steel that meet the evolving market and regulatory demands imposed on them. In connection with this commitment, we have research centers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Košice, Slovakia, an automotive center in Troy, Michigan and a Research and Development Laboratory and Test Facility for Tubular products in Houston, Texas. The focus of these centers is to develop new products and to collaborate with our customers to better provide innovative solutions to serve their needs. Examples of our customer focused product innovation include the development of the first commercially available coated AHSS and GEN3 steels and embedding application engineers at original equipment manufacturers to demonstrate how to best utilize the material in body design to meet automobile passenger safety requirements while significantly reducing weight to meet future vehicle fuel efficiency standards; and a line of premium and semi-premium

tubular connections designed for our customers operating in challenging drilling environments. These connections optimize performance and provide outstanding sealing capabilities for onshore and offshore oil and gas drilling. Engineered, designed, tested and commercialized in 2015, the USS-LIBERTY TC™ premium connection is used by our customers focused on horizontal drilling. Since its introduction, more than 1.5 million feet has been shipped to customers operating in every major shale play in North America. Another successful premium connection, USS-EAGLE SFH™ was introduced in 2017 for customers drilling deep, high-pressure horizontal onshore natural gas and oil wells in North America. Please refer to Item I. Business Strategy for further details of our commercial entities and related strategies.
Workforce
At U. S. Steel, we are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining a workforce of talented and diverse people — all working together to deliver superior results for our Company, stockholders, customers and communities. We regularly review our human capital needs and focus on the selection, development and retention of employees in order to sustain and enhance our competitive position in the markets we serve.
Capital Structure and Liquidity
Our primary financial goal is to enhance stockholder value by focusing on our capital structure, liquidity, and financial flexibility by deploying cash strategically as we earn the right to grow. Our cash deployment strategy is aligned to our strategic priorities, and includes; revitalizing our capital, both human and equipment; strengthening our balance sheet; maintaining a healthy pension plan; and delivering sustainable growth with a focus on safety, quality, delivery and cost.
Our liquidity supports our ability to satisfy short-term obligations, fund working capital requirements, and provides a foundation to execute key strategic initiatives such as our asset revitalization program.
We are focused on strengthening our balance sheet and credit ratings, and may proactively manage our company's debt maturity profile from time to time to protect our capital structure from unforeseen external events and re-financing risks.
In 2017, we undertook several steps to support these goals. The Company issued $750 million of 6.875% Senior Notes due August 15, 2025 and received net proceeds of approximately $737 million, which was used together with cash on hand to repay certain of the Company's outstanding debt obligations. U. S. Steel completed a redemption of all the aggregate principal amount of its $70 million Lorain County Port Authority Recovery Zone Facility Revenue Bonds, and an optional redemption of $161 million of its 7.00% Senior Notes due 2018, $200 million of its 6.875% Senior Notes due 2021, and $400 million of its 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022. Additionally, the Company completed an optional partial redemption of $200 million in aggregate principle amount of its 8.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2021.
In November 2017 we made a voluntary contribution of $75 million to U. S. Steel's main defined benefit pension plan as part of our long term pension liability management strategy.
During 2017, U. S. Steel reduced debt by $328 million and extended the maturities of long-term debt as a result of actions noted above. We ended 2017 with $1.533 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand and total liquidity of approximately $3.350 billion.
Steel Industry Background and Competition
The global steel industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity.
U. S. Steel's competitive position may be affected by, among other things, differences among U. S. Steel's and its competitors' cost structure, labor costs, environmental remediation and compliance costs, global capacity and the existence and magnitude of government subsidies.
U. S. Steel competes with many North American and international steel producers. Competitors include integrated producers, which, like U. S. Steel, use iron ore and coke as the primary raw materials for steel production, as well as electric arc furnace (EAF) producers, which primarily use steel scrap and other iron-bearing feedstocks as raw materials. Global steel capacity has continued to increase, with some published sources estimating that steel capacity in China alone is over one billion metric tons per year. In addition, other materials, such as aluminum, plastics and composites, compete with steel in several applications.
28

EAF producers typically require lower capital expenditures for construction of facilities and may have lower total employment costs; however, these competitive advantages may be minimized or eliminated by the cost of scrap when scrap prices are high. During 2017, certain public scrap prices in certain publications averaged more than 50% higher than 2016. Some mini-mills utilize thin slab casting technology to produce flat-rolled products and are increasingly able to compete directly with integrated producers in many flat-rolled product applications previously produced only by integrated steelmakers.
U. S. Steel provides defined benefit pension and/or other post-employment benefits to approximately 95,000 current employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. Many of our competitors do not have comparable retiree obligations. Participation in U. S. Steel's main defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants on July 1, 2003 and benefit accruals for all non-represented participants were frozen effective December 31, 2015. With amendments effective June 30, 2014, retiree medical and life insurance benefits for non-represented employees were eliminated for those who retire after December 31,2017. The United Steelworkers (USW) ratified successor three year Collective Bargaining Agreements with U. S. Steel and its U. S. Steel Tubular Products, Inc. subsidiary (the 2015 Labor Agreements) on February 1, 2016, which were effective as of September 1, 2015 and expire on September 1, 2018. These 2015 Labor Agreements provided for the closure of other post-employment benefits (OPEB) plans to represented employees hired or rehired under certain conditions on or after January 1, 2016.
We believe that our major North American and many European integrated steel competitors are confronted with substantially similar environmental regulatory conditions and therefore do not believe that our relative position with regard to such competitors will be materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations. However, if future regulations do not recognize the fact that the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions without linking these emissions to steel scrap as well, our competitive position relative to mini-mills will be adversely impacted. Our competitive position compared to producers in developing nations such as China, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Brazil and India, will be harmed unless such nations require commensurate reductions in CO2 emissions. Competing materials such as plastics may not be similarly impacted. The specific impact on each competitor will vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods. U. S. Steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to former and present operating locations and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. Many of our competitors, including North American producers, or their successors, that have been the subject of bankruptcy relief have no or substantially lower liabilities for such environmental remediation matters.
International Trade
U. S. Steel continues to face competition from foreign steel producers, many of which are heavily subsidized by their governments and dump steel into the United States (U.S.) market. Trade-distorting policies and practices, coupled with global steel overcapacity, impact pricing in the U.S. market and influence the Company's ability to compete on a level playing field. U. S. Steel continues to lead the industry in efforts to address dumped and subsidized steel imports that injure the Company, our workers, and our country’s national and economic security.
U. S. Steel continues to be actively engaged in relevant administrative reviews and five-year reviews (Sunset Review) of antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders before the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) and the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), including the following: 

• | On January 30, 2018, the USITC voted to continue the AD order on seamless carbon and alloy steel standard, line, and pressure pipe (SSLPP) from Germany for another five years in the fourth Sunset Review of the 1995 AD order. U. S. Steel actively participated in that Sunset Review. As a result of the USITC’s determination, Mannesmannrohren-Werke AG will continue to be subject to 20.08% AD duties and all other companies will continue to be subject to 57.72% AD duties on SSLPP imports from Germany.


• | On October 2, 2017, the DOC issued preliminary results in the second administrative review of the AD order on oil country tubular goods (OCTG) from Korea for the period September 2015 through August 2016. In its preliminary results, the DOC calculated the dumping margins of 46.37% for Nexteel Co., Ltd., 6.66% for SeAH Steel Corporation and 19.58% for non-examined companies. U. S. Steel is participating in the administrative review, which is currently in the briefing stage. The final results are due on April 11, 2018.


• | On May 1, 2017, the DOC automatically initiated a Sunset Review of the AD order on tin mill products from Japan. The DOC concluded that revocation of the order would lead to margins of up to 95.29%. The USITC concurrently published its notice of institution of the Sunset Review which covers the same order and decided 

29

to conduct a full Sunset Review and vote on continuation of the order in April 2018. U. S. Steel is participating in the Sunset Review and, if successful, the order will remain in effect for another five years.
On December 5, 2017, in response to circumvention petitions filed by U.S. Steel and other domestic steel producers in September 2016, the DOC preliminarily found that imports of cold-rolled and galvanized steel made from Chinese substrate are covered by the AD/CVD orders on such imports from China. As a result of the preliminary determination, U.S. imports of cold-rolled steel from Vietnam made from Chinese hot-rolled steel are subject to 522.23% cash deposit requirements and U.S. imports of galvanized steel from Vietnam made from Chinese hot- or cold-rolled steel are subject to 238.48% cash deposit requirements, both retroactive to November 4, 2016. The DOC's final circumvention determinations are expected in the second quarter of 2018.
U. S. Steel is also actively involved in several appeals before the U.S. Court of International Trade and U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concerning the AD/CVD orders imposed in 2016 on flat-rolled steel cases as well as several OCTG cases.
In April 2016, U. S. Steel launched a case under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against several Chinese producers and their distributors. All but seven of the producers did not respond and are considered to be in default. The complaint alleged three causes of action: 1) illegal conspiracy to fix prices and control output and export volumes; 2) the theft of trade secrets through industrial espionage; and 3) circumvention of duties by false labeling of the steel’s origin and transshipment (FDO). On May 26, 2016, the USITC instituted an investigation on all three causes of action. On February 15, 2017, U. S. Steel voluntarily withdrew the trade secrets claim preserving its right to resurrect the claim when additional information becomes available. On October 2, 2017, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) assigned to the case terminated the FDO claim. The Company has elected not to pursue an appeal leaving the price fixing claim as the remaining claim. That claim is pending before the USITC. The remedy sought by U. S. Steel in that claim is the barring of all Chinese carbon and alloy steel from the U.S. market.
On December 12, 2016, China filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the U.S. and the European Union (EU) alleging that the U.S. and EU are violating their treaty obligations by continuing to use the non-market economy (NME) methodology for price comparisons in antidumping duty investigations and reviews. On April 3, 2017, the DOC issued a notice requesting comments and information on whether China should continue to be treated as a NME country under U.S. antidumping laws. U. S. Steel and other domestic producers submitted comments to the DOC on May 10, 2017. On October 26, 2017, the DOC issued a memorandum concluding that it will continue to use the NME methodology for antidumping proceedings involving imports from China because the state continues to fundamentally distort China’s economy. China then requested additional consultations with the U.S. regarding its WTO complaint. The outcome of these WTO disputes may impact U.S. dumping orders on Chinese goods, including many steel products.
On April 19, 2017, the DOC initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to determine the effects of steel imports on U.S. national security. On May 24, 2017, U. S. Steel testified at the DOC public hearing and remains active in the investigation. On January 11, 2018, the DOC submitted its investigation report to the President, who under the statute has until April 11, 2018 to announce any action based on the DOC findings.
U. S. Steel continually assesses the impact of imports and global excess capacity on our business, and continues to execute a broad, global strategy to enhance the means and manner in which it competes in the U.S. market and internationally.

Seamless products are produced at Fairfield Tubular Operations in Fairfield, Alabama and Lorain Tubular Operations located in Lorain, Ohio. The Fairfield Tubular Operations has annual production capability of 720,000 tons and has historically been supplied with steel rounds from Flat-Rolled’s former Fairfield Works. Subsequent to the shutdown of the hot end at the Fairfield Works in August 2015, the facility is currently purchasing rounds from third parties. At the appropriate time, with continued tubular market improvement, construction of the EAF should be completed and when it is it will be part of the Tubular segment and the Flat-rolled segment will not be supplying Fairfield Tubular Operations with rounds. The Fairfield Tubular Operations has the capability to produce outer diameter (O.D.) sizes from 4.5 to 9.875 inches and has quench and temper, hydrotester, threading and coupling and inspection capabilities. The slab and rounds casters of the former Fairfield Works remain capable of operation and are now part of the Fairfield Tubular Operations. The Lorain plant consists of the #3 facility and has historically consumed steel rounds supplied by Fairfield Works and external sources. Subsequent to the shutdown of the hot end at the Fairfield Works, the Company is sourcing rounds from third parties. Lorain #3 facility has the capability to produce 300,000 tons annually in O.D. sizes from 10.125 to 26 inches and has quench and temper, hydrotester, cutoff and inspection capabilities. In March 2017, U. S. Steel made a strategic decision to permanently shutdown the Lorain No. 6 Quench & Temper Mill and relocate the equipment.

Welded products are produced at Lone Star Tubular Operations #2 facility in Lone Star, Texas and it has the capability to produce O.D. sizes from 1.088 to 7.15 inches.

33

Other Businesses
U. S. Steel’s Other Businesses include railroad services and real estate operations.
U. S. Steel owns the Gary Railway Company in Indiana, Lake Terminal Railroad Company and Lorain Northern Company in Ohio, Union Railroad Company, LLC in Pennsylvania, Fairfield Southern Company, Inc. in Alabama, Delray Connecting Railroad Company in Michigan and Texas & Northern Railroad Company in Texas, these entities comprise U. S. Steel’s transportation business. 
U. S. Steel owns, develops and manages various real estate assets, which include approximately 50,000 acres of surface rights primarily in Alabama and Michigan, with additional holdings in Pennsylvania and Illinois. In addition, U. S. Steel holds ownership interests in joint ventures that are developing real estate projects in Alabama. 
Raw Materials and Energy
As an integrated producer, U. S. Steel’s primary raw materials are iron units in the form of iron ore pellets and sinter ore, carbon units in the form of coal and coke (which is produced from coking coal) and steel scrap. U. S. Steel’s raw materials supply strategy consists of acquiring and expanding captive sources of certain primary raw materials and entering into flexible supply contracts for certain other raw materials at competitive market prices which are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions at the time.
The amounts of such raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products, the quality of raw materials and, to a lesser extent, differences among steel producing equipment. In broad terms, U. S. Steel consumes approximately 1.4 tons of coal to produce one ton of coke and then it consumes approximately 0.3 tons of coke, 0.3 tons of steel scrap (40 percent of which is internally generated) and 1.3 tons of iron ore pellets to produce one ton of raw steel. At normal operating levels, we also consume approximately 6 mmbtu’s of natural gas per ton produced. While we believe that these estimated consumption amounts are useful for planning purposes, and are presented to give a general sense of raw material and energy consumption related to steel production, substantial variations may occur.
Iron Ore
Iron Ore Production(a)
(a) Includes our share of production from Hibbing through December 31, 2017 and Tilden to September 29, 2017. U. S. Steel's ownership interest in Tilden was sold on September 29, 2017. The decrease in iron ore production from 2014 is primarily related to the idling of our Keetac facility. In 2017, the Keetac facility restarted production.
The iron ore facilities at Minntac and Keetac contain an estimated 860 million short tons of recoverable reserves and our share of recoverable reserves at the Hibbing joint ventures is 8 million short tons. Recoverable reserves are defined as the tons of product that can be used internally or delivered to a customer after considering mining and beneficiation or preparation losses. Minntac and Keetac’s annual capability and our share of annual capability for the Hibbing joint 
34

venture total approximately 23 million tons. Through our wholly owned operations and our share of joint ventures, we have iron ore pellet production capability that exceeds our steelmaking capability in the U.S. 
We sold iron ore pellets in 2017, 2016 and 2015 to third parties. The Company has agreements to supply iron ore pellets to third-party customers over the next several years. 
Substantially all of USSE’s iron ore requirements are purchased from outside sources, primarily Russian and Ukrainian mining companies. However, in prior years, USSE also received iron ore from U. S. Steel’s iron ore facilities in North America. We believe that supplies of iron ore adequate to meet USSE’s needs are available at competitive market prices.
Coking Coal
All of U. S. Steel’s coal requirements for our cokemaking facilities are purchased from outside sources. Pricing for Flat-Rolled's coking coal contracts are typically negotiated on a yearly basis, and from time to time we have entered into multi-year agreements for a portion of our coking coal requirements. 
Prices for European contracts are negotiated at defined intervals, usually quarterly.
We believe that supplies of coking coal adequate to meet our needs are available from outside sources at competitive market prices. The main source of coking coal for Flat-Rolled is the United States, and sources for USSE include Poland, the Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine, Mozambique and the United States.
Coke
Coke Production(a)
(a) The decrease in 2016 coke production from 2015 was due to decreased internal steel production and depletion of existing coke inventory. The decrease in 2015 coke production from 2014 is due to the permanent shutdown of coke operations at Gary Works and Granite City Works. The decrease in 2014 coke production from 2013 is primarily due to the deconsolidation of USSC and the permanent shut down of two coke batteries at Gary Works.
In North America, the Flat-Rolled segment operates a cokemaking facility at the Clairton Plant of Mon Valley Works. At our Granite City Works, we also have a 15-year coke supply agreement with Gateway which began in 2009. Blast furnace injection of coal, and self-generated coke oven gas is also used to reduce coke usage. 
With Flat-Rolled’s cokemaking facilities and the Gateway long-term supply agreement, it has the capability to be self-sufficient with respect to its annual coke requirements at normal operating levels. Coke is purchased from, sold to, or swapped with suppliers and other end-users to adjust for production needs and reduce transportation costs.
In Europe, the USSE segment operates cokemaking facilities at USSK. While USSE is self-sufficient for coke at normal operating levels, it periodically purchases coke from Polish and Czech coke producers to meet production needs. Volume and price are negotiated quarterly.
35

Steel Scrap and Other Materials
We believe that supplies of steel scrap, alloys and coating materials adequate to meet our needs to support Flat-Rolled and USSE are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices. Generally, approximately 40 percent of our steel scrap requirements are internally generated through normal operations.
Limestone
All of Flat-Rolled’s and USSE's limestone requirements are purchased from outside sources. We believe that supplies of limestone adequate to meet our needs are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices.
Zinc and Tin
We believe that supplies of zinc and tin required to fulfill the requirements for Flat-Rolled and USSE are available from outside sources at competitive market prices. The main sources of tin for Flat-Rolled include Bolivia and China. The main sources of zinc for Flat-Rolled include Canada and Mexico. During 2017, Flat-Rolled protected approximately 80% of its operation's zinc purchases with financial swap derivatives to manage our exposure to zinc price fluctuations. The main sources of tin for USSE include Indonesia, Peru and China. The main sources of zinc for USSE include Sweden, the Slovak Republic and Poland. During 2017, USSE executed approximately 40% of USSE's zinc purchases with forward physical contracts to partially manage our exposure to zinc price fluctuations.
Natural Gas
All of U. S. Steel’s natural gas requirements are purchased from outside sources.
We believe that adequate supplies to meet Flat-Rolled’s and Tubular's needs are available at competitive market prices. For 2017, approximately 70 percent of our natural gas purchases in Flat-Rolled were based on bids solicited on a monthly basis from various vendors; the remainder were made daily or with term agreements. 
We believe that adequate natural gas supplies to meet USSE’s needs are available at competitive market prices. During 2017, we routinely executed fixed-price forward physical purchase contract for natural gas to partially manage our exposure to natural gas price increases. For 2017, approximately 56 percent of our natural gas purchases in USSK were made with fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts; the remainder were based on bids solicited on a quarterly, monthly or a daily basis from various vendors.
Both Flat-Rolled and USSE use self-generated coke oven and blast furnace gas to reduce consumption of natural gas. USSE also captures and consumes converter gas from its four steelmaking vessels.
Industrial Gases
U. S. Steel purchases industrial gas in the U.S. under long-term contracts with various suppliers. USSE owns and operates its own industrial gas facilities, but also may purchase industrial gases from time to time.
Commercial Sales of Product 
U. S. Steel characterizes sales as contract sales if sold pursuant to an agreement with a defined volume and pricing and a duration of longer than three months, and as spot if sold without a defined volume and pricing agreement. In 2017, approximately 79 percent, 64 percent and 53 percent of sales by Flat-Rolled, USSE and Tubular, respectively, were contract sales. Some contract pricing agreements include fixed prices while others are adjusted periodically based upon published prices of steel products or cost components. 
Environmental Matters
Some of U. S. Steel’s facilities were in operation before 1900. Although management believes that U. S. Steel’s environmental practices have either led the industry or at least been consistent with prevailing industry practices, hazardous materials may have been released at current or former operating sites or delivered to sites operated by third parties.
Our U.S. facilities are subject to environmental laws applicable in the U.S., including the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as well as state and local laws and regulations.
36

U. S. Steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating, and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations, related to release of hazardous materials, which in recent years have been mainly for process changes to meet CAA obligations and similar obligations in Europe.
Midwest Plant Incident
On April 11, 2017, there was a process waste water release at our Midwest Plant (Midwest) in Portage, Indiana that impacted a water outfall that discharges to Burns Waterway near Lake Michigan.  U. S. Steel identified the source of the release and made the necessary repairs.  We determined that all repairs were safely working as intended and, on April 14, 2017, resumed operations in a controlled, phased and highly monitored approach with extensive input from participating government agencies. The Company has since implemented substantial operational, process and notification improvements at Midwest.  The Company has been presented with cost reimbursements, loss of use and penalty requests from the involved governmental agencies and intends to amicably resolve the matter with those agencies. Separately, the Company was placed on notice of potential citizens’ enforcement suits regarding the April 2017 incident and other historical alleged Clean Water Act and Permit violations at Midwest.  In January of 2018, The Surfrider Foundation and the City of Chicago initiated suits in the Northern District of Indiana alleging such violations. The Company intends to defend against those actions.
Slovak Operations
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed in March 2013 between U. S. Steel and the government of Slovakia. The MOU outlines areas in which the government and U. S. Steel will work together to help create a more competitive environment and conditions for USSK. Incentives the government of Slovakia agreed to provide include potential participation in a renewable energy program that provides the opportunity to reduce electricity costs, as well as the potential for government grants and other support concerning investments in environmental control technology. Although there are many conditions and uncertainties regarding the grants, including matters controlled by the European Union (EU), the value of these incentives as stated in the MOU could be as much as €75 million (approximately $90 million). U. S. Steel also agreed to pay the government of Slovakia specified declining amounts should U. S. Steel sell USSK within five years of the date of the MOU. We expect the total amount of EU funds will be as much as €85 million (approximately $102 million). The final grant value will depend on public procurement results. The MOU is set to expire in March 2018.
Slovakia adopted a new waste code in March 2015 that became effective January 1, 2016. This legislation implements the EU Waste Framework Directive that strictly regulates waste disposal and encourages recycling, among other provisions, by increasing fees for waste disposed of in landfills, including privately owned landfills. The impact of this legislation is estimated to be €2 million (approximately $2 million) annually due to waste stabilization requirements and increased fees for packaging materials recycling fees. Slovakia is considering legislation implementing an EU Directive, which is expected to increase existing fees upon USSK for use of its landfills. Because the legislation has not yet been adopted, the impact on operations at USSK facilities cannot be estimated at this time.
The EU’s Industry Emission Directive requires implementation of EU determined best available techniques (BAT) to reduce environmental impacts as well as compliance with BAT associated emission levels. This directive includes operational requirements for air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid waste disposal and energy conservation, dictates certain operating practices and imposes stricter emission limits. Producers were required to be in compliance with the iron and steel BAT by March 8, 2016, unless specific exceptions or extensions were granted by the Slovak environmental authority. USSK updated existing operating permits for different facilities involved in producing iron and steel in the plant in accordance with the new BAT requirements. Through this process for some facilities, USSK has obtained extensions from the 2016 compliance deadline in order to meet or exceed the BAT requirements. Compliance with stricter emission limits going beyond BAT requirements makes us eligible for EU funding support and prepares us for any further tightening of environmental protection standards. Our most recent broad estimate of likely capital expenditures for projects to comply with or go beyond the BAT requirements is €138 million (approximately $166 million) over the 2017 to 2020 time period.
The EU has various programs under which funds are allocated to member states to implement broad public policies which are then awarded by the member states to public and private entities on a competitive basis. The funding intensity under these programs currently ranges from 55 percent of defined eligible costs on a project under the standard state scheme to 90 percent on an approved ad hoc scheme to improve the air quality in the Košice region of Slovakia. Based on our list of projects that comprise the approximate €138 million (approximately $166 million) of spending

noted, we currently believe we will be eligible to receive up to €85 million (approximately $102 million) of incentive grants. This could potentially reduce our net cash expenditures to approximately €53 million (approximately $64 million). The actual amount of capital spending will be dependent upon, among other things, the actual amount of incentive grants received.
We also believe there will be increased operating costs associated with these projects, such as increased energy and maintenance costs. We are currently unable to reliably estimate what the increase in operating costs will be as many projects are still in the development stage.
On March 28, 2017, the Regional Court in Košice issued an ex parte judicial lien on USSK's real property to plaintiffs in an ongoing legal case. Following a decision of the Supreme Court, which reversed and remanded the lien petition to the Regional Court, the lien has been removed. The case is still ongoing. We do not expect this matter to have an impact on the eligibility of USSK to obtain EU funding support for BAT projects.

New and Emerging Environmental Regulations
United States and European Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulations
Future compliance with carbon dioxide (CO2) emission requirements may include substantial costs for emission allowances, restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal, natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems. Because we cannot predict what requirements ultimately will be imposed in the U.S. and Europe, it is difficult to estimate the likely impact on U. S. Steel, but it could be substantial. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order 13783 instructing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review the Clean Power Plan. On October 16, 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan after reviewing the plan pursuant to President Trump’s executive order. Any repeal and/or replacement of the Clean Power Plan is likely to be challenged by various proponents of the plan, such as environmental groups and certain states. Any impacts to our operations as a result of any future greenhouse gas regulations are not estimable at this time since the matter is unsettled. In any case, to the extent expenditures associated with any greenhouse gas regulation, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of U. S. Steel's products and services, operating results will be reduced. There were no material changes in U. S. Steel’s exposure to European Greenhouse Gas Emissions regulations since December 31, 2016.
United States - Air
The CAA imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program and civil and criminal enforcement sanctions. The CAA requires, among other things, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Standards. The EPA has developed various industry-specific MACT standards pursuant to this requirement. The CAA requires the EPA to promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category of Hazardous Air Pollutants. The EPA also must conduct risk assessments on each source category that is already subject to MACT standards and determine if additional standards are needed to reduce residual risks.
While our operations are subject to several different categories of NESHAP and MACT standards, the principal impact of these standards on U. S. Steel operations includes those that are specific to coke making, iron making, steel making and iron ore processing.
The EPA is currently in the process of completing a Residual Risk and Technology Review of the Integrated Iron and Steel regulations and Coke MACT regulations as required by the CAA. Because the EPA has not completed its review, any impacts related to the EPA’s review of these standards cannot be estimated at this time.
The CAA also requires the EPA to develop and implement National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria pollutants, which include, among others, particulate matter (PM) - consisting of PM10 and PM2.5, lead, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. Sulfur dioxide is the NAAQS criteria pollutant of most concern to the Company at this time.
38

In June 2010, the EPA significantly lowered the primary NAAQS for sulfur dioxide (SO2) from 140 parts per billion (ppb) on a 24-hour basis to an hourly standard of 75 ppb. Subsequently, the EPA designated the areas in which Great Lakes Works and Mon Valley Works facilities are located as nonattainment with the 2010 standard for the SO2 NAAQS. The non-attainment designation will require the facilities to implement operational and/or capital improvements to demonstrate attainment with the 2010 standard. In addition, the EPA is currently evaluating the attainment status for all other areas as required by a Consent Decree that the EPA entered with the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council in March 2015 pursuant to a lawsuit filed by the non-governmental organizations. U. S. Steel is working with the relevant regulatory agencies in completing the evaluation process as required by the Consent Decree. While U. S. Steel has determined that it will face increased capital, operating and compliance costs, the operational and financial impact of the SO2 NAAQS is not estimated to be material at this time.
In October 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. The EPA has designated certain areas in which we operate as nonattainment with the 2008 ozone standard. In addition, some areas in which we operate have been recommended as nonattainment with the 2015 ozone standard by the respective states. The EPA has yet to act on the recommendations. In June 2017, the EPA had published a notice extending the deadline to promulgate initial designations by one year, extending the deadline from October 1, 2017 to October 1, 2018. However, in August 2017, the EPA withdrew the notice; and therefore, the designation deadline remained October 1, 2017. On November 16, 2017, the EPA published its initial designations for areas that the EPA is designating as attainment/unclassifiable. The rule lists most areas in which U. S. Steel operates as attainment/unclassifiable. The EPA has yet to publish a notice regarding areas that it is designating as nonattainment. Because nonattainment designations and any implementation plans to bring the ozone nonattainment areas into attainment have yet to be proposed or developed, the operational and financial impact of the ozone NAAQS cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
On December 14, 2012, the EPA lowered the annual standard for PM2.5 from 15 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) to 12 ug/m3, and retained the PM2.5 24-hour and PM10 NAAQS rules. In December 2014, the EPA designated some areas in which U. S. Steel operates as nonattainment with the 2012 annual PM2.5 standard. Because it is early in the State Implementation Plan development stages, any impacts to U. S. Steel cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
In 2010, the EPA retained the annual nitrogen dioxide NAAQS standard, but created a new 1-hour NAAQS and established new data reduction and monitoring requirements. While the EPA has classified all areas as being in attainment or unclassifiable, it is requiring implementation of a network of monitoring stations to assess air quality. Until the network is implemented and further designations are made, the impact on operations at U. S. Steel facilities cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
United States - CERCLA 108(b) Financial Assurance
In December 2016, the EPA published a proposed rule focused on developing financial assurance for managing hazardous substances in the hard rock, mining industry, in accordance with CERCLA Section 108(b). The EPA had a court-mandated deadline for publication of the final rule by December 1, 2017. The draft form of the proposed rule was commented upon by the public and the regulated community. Based on information provided by the comments, EPA decided that a new financial assurance rule was not necessary for the hard rock mining industry. EPA’s decision may be challenged in court and a possible result of such a challenge may be a new proposed rule at some point in the future that could have a material impact on the Company’s liquidity.
Environmental Remediation
In the United States, U. S. Steel has been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at seven sites under CERCLA as of December 31, 2017. Of these, there are two sites where information requests have been received or there are other indications that U. S. Steel may be a PRP under CERCLA, but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability or to make a reasonable estimate with respect to any potential liabilities. There are also 19 additional sites where U. S. Steel may be liable for remediation costs in excess of $100,000 under other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking to impose liability on U. S. Steel for remediation costs through discussions or litigation. At many of these sites, U. S. Steel is one of a number of parties involved and the total cost of remediation, as well as U. S. Steel’s share, is frequently dependent upon the outcome of ongoing investigations and remedial studies. U. S. Steel accrues for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.

Employees 
As of December 31, 2017, U. S. Steel had approximately 17,200 employees in the U.S. and approximately 12,000 in Europe.
Most hourly employees of U. S. Steel’s flat-rolled, tubular, cokemaking and iron ore pellet facilities in the United States are covered by the 2015 Labor Agreements. Our U.S. collective bargaining agreements contain no-strike provisions which are applicable during the term of the respective agreements. 
In Europe, excluding U.S. expatriates, most employees at USSK are represented by the OZ KOVO union and all employees are covered by an agreement that expires at the end of March 2020.
A small number of workers at some of our North American facilities and at our transportation operations are covered by agreements with the USW or other unions that have varying expiration dates.
