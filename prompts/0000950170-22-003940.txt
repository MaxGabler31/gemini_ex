Item 1. Business
 
Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. is a global sports and entertainment company. We own and operate premium sports properties, including the UFC, produce and distribute sports and entertainment content, own and manage exclusive live events and experiences, and represent top sports and entertainment talent, as well as blue chip corporate clients. Founded as a client representation business, we expanded organically and through strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in new capabilities, including sports operations and advisory, events and experiences management, media production and distribution, brand licensing, and experiential marketing. Today the integration of our broad range of capabilities, along with our owned and managed premium sports and entertainment properties, drives network effects across our platform. We measure these effects by evaluating the impact that activity in one business segment has on growth in another.
 
We believe that our unique business model gives us a competitive advantage in the industries in which we operate. Our direct ownership of scarce sports properties positions us to directly benefit from the generally rising value of sports assets, while giving us direct control to make decisions that sustain the long-term value of our properties. Our dual role as an intellectual property owner and as a trusted advisor to clients and rights holders allows us to make connections across our platform, increasing the earnings of our clients and the value of our sports and entertainment properties. We generally participate in the upside related to the commercial success of content with limited risk and we benefit from demand from both traditional and next generation distributors. We own and manage a diverse mix of live and virtual events and experiences in the sports, entertainment, fashion, and art categories. The insights we gain from our connectivity across the sports and entertainment ecosystem may enable us to spot trends before they emerge and make strategic investments to enhance our growth.
    We operate across three segments: (i) Owned Sports Properties, (ii) Events, Experiences & Rights, and (iii) Representation, which are covered in greater detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Overview.” Our segments are presented in the table below:


We generate revenue in both a principal and an agency capacity and use risk mitigation strategies including pre-sales and licensing when we take on investment risk in content or sports rights. Our business has benefited from strong revenue visibility via sports rights fee payments, predictable client commissions, content rights payments, recurring annual or quadrennial events, corporate client retainers, licensing agreements, and annual tuition payments. We believe that visibility into our performance provides us with a stable and growing revenue base.
 
Our Business and Integrated Global Platform
 
Across our segments, our global platform of premium owned assets and integrated set of capabilities, including Client Representation, Media Production & Distribution, Experiential Marketing, and Brand Licensing, drives revenue generation opportunities, improves client retention, and increases the flow of acquisition and investment opportunities.

Given the architecture of our Company, we are able to drive powerful network effects that reinforce the value of the platform. We believe the greater the depth of our capabilities and global reach, the greater our ability to retain clients and drive new signings. The more top-tier clients we bring to market, the more relevant we become to streamers, linear networks, and corporate partners. The more sports, events, and experiences inventory we have, the more opportunity we can deliver to our global sponsors. We also believe that our growing global insights enhance our judgment on investments made, while the more we are able to learn from our clients, the more we can enhance the value and growth we deliver long term.
 
Owned Sports Properties
       We believe that our Company is distinguished by our ownership of intellectual property, including UFC, a global sports property and the premier mixed martial arts sports organization, and PBR, an internationally renowned Western lifestyle competitive event series. UFC was founded in 1993 and has grown in popularity after hosting more than 500 events, growing its fan base to more than 625 million fans, and now reaching a global audience of approximately 1 billion households through an increasing array of broadcast license agreements and our owned FIGHT PASS streaming platform. PBR is the world’s premier bull riding circuit with more than 500 bull riders competing in more than 200 bull riding events each year. PBR’s two primary US tours have averaged over 10% annual attendance growth since PBR was acquired in 2015. We also have an up to 20-year strategic partnership with Euroleague, consisting of an initial 10-year term that began in 2016 with a 10-year renewal provision subject to certain conditions. As sports property owners, we retain control over the organization, promotion and marketing of UFC and PBR, and the monetization of their events and media distribution. At the end of 2021, we acquired six Professional Development League clubs (the "PDL Clubs"), affiliated with the Atlanta Braves, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees and St. Louis Cardinals.
Events, Experiences & Rights
 
We own, operate, or represent more than 800 events annually around the globe, including live sports events covering more than 15 sports across more than 25 countries (e.g. Miami Open), international fashion weeks (e.g. New York Fashion Week), art fairs (e.g. Frieze London), and music, culinary, and lifestyle festivals (e.g. Hyde Park Winter Wonderland). In January 2020, we acquired On Location, a leading provider of premium live event experiences across sports and music in North America with more than 900 experiences built around major events like the Super Bowl, Ryder Cup, NCAA Final Four, Coachella and upcoming Olympic Games. We also operate IMG Academy, a sports training institution serving more than 1,200 full-time students and approximately 10,000 campers and adult athletes annually, and dozens of professional athletes, teams, leagues, and corporate clients annually.
 
In addition, we are a full-service content production and distribution platform with experience in development, financing, production, marketing and sales, servicing hundreds of creators, sports leagues and federations, events and other brands, as well as our owned sports intellectual property. Our state-of-the-art studios produce tens of thousands of hours of sports programming annually for leading sports properties, such as the English Premier League, Wimbledon, and Ryder Cup, as well as for our owned assets including UFC and PBR.

As one of the largest independent global distributors of sports and entertainment programming, we sell media rights globally on behalf of more than 150 clients, such as the International Olympic Committee ("IOC"), the National Football League ("NFL") and the National Hockey League ("NHL") and for our owned assets including UFC and PBR. We also provide league advisory services given the array of experience we have to offer. Through IMG ARENA, we work with more than 470 leading sportsbook brands worldwide to deliver live streaming video and data feeds for more than 45,000 sports events annually, as well as for on-demand virtual sports products including our own UFC Event Centre. We leverage the technology derived from IMG ARENA to provide streaming video solutions to our clients and our owned assets via Endeavor Streaming. We believe that our collective offering is more important than ever, as premium content is consistently in high demand and in short supply.
 
Representation
 
We represent many of the world’s greatest creators, performers, influencers, athletes, and models across entertainment, sports, and fashion. In 2021, WME clients were involved in eight of the top 10 grossing films at the domestic box office. We were responsible for arranging the essential elements for more than 330 scripted series on broadcast, cable, and streaming channels. WME also closed deals for more than 150 new books, including 87 bestsellers, with 18 at No. 1. We had a strong presence at major music festivals in 2021– with three out of the four headliners at Lollapalooza – and in theater, WME clients took home 10 wins at the 2021 Tony Awards. We are dedicated to helping our clients increase the monetization potential of their intellectual property, build enduring brands, diversify and grow their businesses, and expand their geographic reach.

We are also a leading provider of licensing services to entertainment, sports, and consumer products brands, having earned a No. 1 ranking based on total retail sales of nearly $15 billion, according to License Global magazine in 2021. We license our owned intellectual property including the UFC and PBR, and represent third party brands across the automotive, fashion, lifestyle, entertainment, athletics, legends, personalities, corporate, sports league, and event categories. Our clients include Anheuser-Busch InBev, Jeep, Lamborghini, Epic Games (Fortnite), Arnold Palmer, Harvard, the Gap, and the NFL.

Meanwhile, our corporate marketing services are delivered by 160over90, our premium, full-service marketing business that provides experiential, influencer, digital and cultural marketing, and public relations expertise. We work on behalf of some of the world’s largest consumer facing brands that collectively spend over $80 billion in worldwide advertising annually according to AdAge in 2020, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, AT&T, and Coca-Cola. Through our platform of owned and operated events and represented clients, our marketing services have access to unique content and activation opportunities, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
Ownership of Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our Company is distinguished by our ownership of scarce intellectual property, including UFC, PBR and Euroleague. UFC posted its best year ever in 2021, including signing landmark partnership deals with Crypto.com and DraftKings. PBR live attendance, sponsorship revenue and licensing revenue are all up significantly since our 2015 acquisition, and the sport has broadened its distribution on multiple fronts, including with a long-term, linear TV deal with CBS and streaming service on PlutoTV. In addition to these sports properties, we also own marquee global events including the Miami Open, HSBC Champions, Frieze Art Fair, New York Fashion Week, and Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, which have seen significant increases in sponsorship and hospitality sales generated between 2019 and 2021.
Perpetual Demand for Premium Content
 
Our platform allows us to participate in industries that are benefitting from increasing demand for content in all forms. We are positioned at the center of this demand through our owned sports properties, media production and distribution, and client representation businesses. We operate across all genres and benefit regardless of how and where the demand for this content is fulfilled. In 2021, we had more than 330 new and returning WME series across broadcast, cable and streaming, converted more than 230 books to film/television and closed more than 200 podcast deals. Premium sports and entertainment content values have consistently appreciated as new distribution models and technology broaden access and enhance the consumer experience. The value of sports programming has significantly increased as media networks and over-the-top services rely on premium sports to differentiate their offerings and retain subscribers. Disruption has increased the value of sports media rights as illustrated in consistent increases in Contract Average Annual Values (AAV) over previous contracts. As digital video distribution services such as ESPN+, Disney+, Peacock, HBO Max, and others have proliferated in recent years, demand has surged. Additionally, commercially successful movies and television programming have lasting resonance that drives consumption at release and over time across multiple points of purchase. The long tail of premium content has thereby enabled significant value creation to accrue to the creators who we represent as well as shareholders.
Positioned Where the Consumer is Going in Experiential
 
According to 2018 research presented by Expedia and The Center for Generational Kinetics, LLC, 74% of Americans place more value on experiences than products or things. A University of Texas at Austin research paper published in May 2020 found that consumers were happier when spending on experiences as opposed to material items. This trend has driven us to invest in our portfolio of more than 800 events globally across sports, music, art, fashion, and culinary. Our premium events include UFC, PBR, Miami Open, Frieze Art Fair, Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, and New York Fashion Week. Through IMG Academy and Next College Student Athlete ("NCSA"), we offer an elite academic and athletic experience, with 90% of Academy graduates moving on to play collegiate sports in 2021 (compared to 7% nationally). On Location, meanwhile, is a leading provider of premium entertainment and travel experiences, offering a large portfolio of events, tours, and hospitality packages across sports and music events including the Super Bowl, which experienced record hospitality sales for Super Bowl LVI (2022), marking the largest single hospitality event in the business’ history, as well as the future Olympic Games, the Ryder Cup, NCAA Final Four, and Coachella.
Creating Asymmetric Risk / Reward Opportunities
 
We believe that the insights that we have gained from our vast network reduce the risk of organic investment and mergers and acquisitions. Our team evaluates potential merger and acquisition opportunities with the benefit of data and industry knowledge that enables us to identify integration synergies and better forecast revenue growth potential. Our role as an industry counterpart often avails us early insights into strategic processes. We often have the opportunity to invest in and support new business ventures that we have negotiated on behalf of our clients, and our commission structure allows us to participate alongside them in their commercial success. In 2021, we closed more than 30 equity deals within this framework on behalf of clients and invested in several as a company.
Platform Integration Drives Upside for Our Stakeholders
 
The practical linkages between our business units have produced myriad examples of maximized revenue generation opportunities, improved client acquisition and retention, and proprietary acquisition and investment opportunities. Each of our owned assets and capabilities reinforces the others, creating a global platform that is very difficult to replicate. We have executed multi-pronged growth strategies on behalf of clients such as Serena Williams, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Mark Wahlberg, Maria Sharapova, and many others, leveraging our network to forge meaningful partnerships between our talent and brands. Through our deep relationships and expertise in sports like golf and tennis, we have expanded our capabilities in the sports betting and data industry via IMG ARENA. Our sports rights and representation businesses have similarly helped unlock investment and advisory opportunities for properties such as the PGA and Euroleague. We have realized top line and cost synergies as we have integrated more than 20 acquisitions including IMG, UFC, PBR, 160over90, On Location and NCSA.
Strong Revenue Visibility
 
Our services are underpinned by highly visible and recurring revenue streams across the platform. A primary example is our 7-year UFC media rights deal with ESPN. We have numerous similarly contracted revenue streams from media rights contracts in our media rights and distribution business. Our work with recurring annual events such as Wimbledon and quadrennial events such as the Rugby World Cup adds to the recurring revenue nature of our business. We also have retainer-based agreements with many of our marketing clients and visibility into commissions on licensing arrangements. Our representation business benefits from revenue visibility, as measured by industry award recognitions, predictable production volumes, and residual income streams from past client bookings and content packages. We also benefit from strong revenue visibility from annual owned and operated events like the Miami Open and New York Fashion Week, which have been running successfully for decades. Finally, our four-year tuition-based IMG Academy provides a high degree of revenue visibility.
Our Growth Strategies
 
Leverage Our Platform to Expand Globally and Increase Platform Productivity
 
We intend to continue leveraging our integrated global platform to maximize the growth potential of our business. The convergence of the sports, entertainment, live events, and technology ecosystems has expanded use cases, exposure and monetization opportunities for our premium
intellectual property, content and experiences, and our clients. We believe that our integrated capabilities and global reach allow us to deepen relationships with existing clients, attract new clients and partners, and access proprietary acquisition and investment opportunities that contribute to our growth and strengthen our network. We have had success moving our clients across the platform, increasing their monetization capacity and improving our growth.
Expand our Experiential Offering
 
The concert, sports, and live entertainment categories have been increasingly prioritized over material goods by younger demographics. With a portfolio of more than 800 owned or managed events across Endeavor and 900 experiences curated by On Location, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these continuing secular trends and create new offerings and investment opportunities. IMG Academy, meanwhile, is a sports training institution with the ability to expand its campus footprint as well as its products and offerings, such as the addition of virtual training and digital recruiting.
Invest in Adjacent High Growth Industry Segments
 
Our global platform has enabled us to enter new, fast-growing industry segments where we are able to leverage long standing business partnerships and relevant commercial insights to accelerate scale. Many of our businesses have historically grown faster than their industry benchmarks in Global Media Rights Expenditure, Premium Content and Global Sports Gaming, to name a few. Our existing footprint, meanwhile, helps to facilitate organic investment in new adjacent industry segments. We have successfully executed against these opportunities that have emerged in sports gaming (IMG ARENA), streaming (Endeavor Streaming), experiential marketing (160over90), and partnerships with our clients (Talent Ventures).
Emphasize Strategic Growth Through Mergers and Acquisitions on Our Unique Platform
 
Our disciplined mergers and acquisitions strategy has been focused on investing in intellectual property and acquiring capabilities for our global platform. We have successfully completed more than 20 mergers and acquisitions since 2014. We will continue to invest in mergers and acquisitions (i.e., OpenBet, Madrid Open) to complement our internal capabilities and enhance the value of our network. We believe that a highly curated owned intellectual property asset base, diverse client mix, and global capabilities set further enhances the ecosystem connectivity that makes our platform the ideal home for numerous future acquisition targets that fit the profile of our investment strategy.
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
 
We consider intellectual property to be very important to the operation of our business and to driving growth in our revenues, particularly with respect to professional engagements, sponsorships, licensing rights, and media distribution agreements. Our intellectual property includes the “Endeavor,” “WME,” “William Morris Endeavor,” “IMG,” “UFC,” “Miss Universe” and “PBR” brands in addition to the trademarks and copyrights associated with our content and events, and the rights to use the intellectual property of our commercial partners. Substantially all of our intellectual property and owned assets that we acquire are protected by trademarks and copyright, whether registered or unregistered.
Competition
 
The entertainment, sports, and content industries in which we participate are highly competitive. We face competition from alternative providers of the services, content, and events we and our clients and owned assets offer and from other forms of entertainment and leisure activities.
 
In our Events, Experiences & Rights segment, we face competition from other live, filmed, televised and streamed entertainment, including competition from other companies in the media rights industry. In our Representation segment, we compete with other agencies that represent and/or manage clients including talent and brands. In our Owned Sports Properties segment, we face competition from sports leagues, associations, promotions, and events. For a discussion of risks relating to competition, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within the United States and internationally.”
 
Human Capital Resources
 
General
 
We believe the strength of our workforce is critical to our long-term success. Endeavor’s human capital management objectives include attracting, retaining, and developing high performing and diverse talent and empowering them with our guiding principles of persistence, collaboration, excellence, and inclusion.

As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 7,700 employees in 29 countries. This includes over 5,300 employees in five countries in the Americas, over 1,900 employees in 12 countries in EMEA, and over 430 employees in 12 countries in APAC. We have invested and focused extensively on the training and development of our employees, from both a personnel and technology perspective. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
 
Talent Development
 
Endeavor recognizes nurturing talent and embracing the constant evolution that leadership requires is crucial to our collective success. We have invested in learning opportunities that strengthen the role of leaders, as well as offering all employees opportunities for professional growth and skill development through free access to a broad range of courses and presentations on varying industry topics.
Diversity and Inclusion
 
Endeavor strives to create a work environment that is more reflective of the diverse communities in which we work and to use our cultural influence to challenge methods and systems that result in inequity. The Company has established initiatives to address pressing societal issues through advocacy and action within our own walls and beyond. We recognize diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) is intrinsically linked to business success and have established company-wide working groups and dedicated accountability teams of company leaders (vice president-level and above) to ensure ongoing progress is made.

To continue advancing our efforts to ensure our global workforce is more representative of our communities, we launched and/or expanded the following initiatives in 2021:
 •Created and distributed Diversity Accountability Dashboards, comprised of divisional representation metrics from each of our businesses, which are overseen by senior leaders across each business, along with an accompanying accountability matrix to help remain in line with overarching Endeavor-wide goals and commitments;
 •Enhanced a range of key recruitment practices, including formalizing our employee referral program to help limit patronage hiring; standardizing WME’s trainee recruitment program to ensure a fair and equitable selection process; and conducting substantial recruiting efforts among participants in our industry access programs, who are largely from historically excluded and/or underrepresented backgrounds;
 •Expanded our MindGym Global Bias Awareness and Allyship Training, launching the second in a series of two workshops. The training was attended by thousands of existing employees globally and remains available for every new hire;
 •Launched a new Self-ID Campaign in the U.K., allowing for current and new employees to self-identify based on race/ethnicity, gender-identity (inclusive of transgender identification), sexual orientation and more;
 •Brought in third-party experts to facilitate leadership development workshops at offsites across a range of businesses, including for Endeavor's executive leadership team;
 •Launched a new training program in partnership with GLAAD encompassing two parts: LGBTQ+ 101 and 201, built to educate and familiarize employees with the LGBTQ+ experience and help enhance awareness and advocacy in the representation of LGBTQ+ talent; and
 •Completed our year-one industry commitments under #ChangeHollywood and continued our partnership with Color of Change to establish a range of commitments for year two.
    Compensation and Benefits
 
The objective of our compensation and benefits programs is to provide a total rewards package that will attract, retain, motivate and reward high-performing, qualified and skilled workforce necessary for our continued success across our diverse businesses. We seek to do this by linking compensation to company and business unit performance, as well each individual’s contributions to the results achieved. In addition to competitive base salaries, the company accomplishes this through annual cash-based bonus plans for eligible employees and long-term incentive plans for its executives.
 
Endeavor is committed to providing comprehensive benefit programs that enhance the total well-being of our people – and their families – both in and outside of work. Our programs are designed to inspire our people to prosper physically, mentally, socially, and financially. Some examples of our wide ranging benefits offered include: health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan, life insurance, disability/accident coverage, and mental health counseling and support.
 
COVID-19 Response
 
The health and safety of our employees, talent, event attendees, and communities in which we operate is a top priority. We have implemented safety protocols at events and in offices in line with expert guidelines and government regulations where applicable.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented policies that we consider to be in the best interest of employees. We believe we have been able to continue business operations seamlessly without sacrificing our commitment to keeping employees safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Regulation and Legislation
 
We are subject to federal, state and local laws, both domestically and internationally, and at the state level by athletic commissions, governing matters such as:
 •licensing laws for talent agencies, such as California’s Talent Agencies Act and the New York General Business Law;

•licensing laws for athletes;
 •operation of our venues;
 •licensing, permitting, and zoning;
 •health, safety, and sanitation requirements;
 •the service of food and alcoholic beverages;
 •working conditions, labor, minimum wage and hour, citizenship, immigration, visas, harassment and discrimination, and other labor and employment laws and regulations
 •our employment of youth workers and compliance with child labor laws;
 •compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the "FCPA"), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the "Bribery Act") and similar regulations in other countries, as described in more detail below;
 •antitrust and fair competition;
 •data privacy and information security;
 •marketing activities;
 •environmental protection regulations;
 •imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions, or currency exchange controls;
 •licensure and other regulatory requirement for the supply of sports betting data and software to gambling operators;
 •licensing laws for the promotion and operation of MMA events; and 
 •government regulation of the entertainment and sports industry.
    We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are subject to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental regulations, and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business.”

Many of the events produced or promoted by our businesses are presented in venues which are subject to building and health codes and fire regulations imposed by the state and local governments in the jurisdictions in which the venues are located. These venues are also subject to zoning and outdoor advertising regulations and require a number of licenses in order for us to operate, including occupancy permits, exhibition licenses, food and beverage permits, liquor licenses, and other authorizations. In addition, these venues are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the U.K.’s Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which require us to maintain certain accessibility features at each of the facilities. Lastly, these venues have been subject to federal and local restrictions from time to time as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In various states in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, we are required to obtain licenses for promoters, medical clearances and other permits or licenses for our athletes, and permits for UFC’s live events in order for us to promote and conduct those events. Generally, we or our employees hold promoters and matchmakers licenses to organize and hold UFC’s live events. We or our employees hold these licenses in a number of states, including California, Nevada, New Jersey, and New York.

We are required to comply with the anti-corruption laws of the countries in which we operate, including the FCPA and the Bribery Act. These regulations make it illegal for us to pay, promise to pay, or receive money or anything of value to, or from, any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business. This ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute.

Our entertainment, sports, and content businesses are also subject to certain regulations applicable to our web sites and mobile applications. We maintain various web sites and mobile applications that provide information and content regarding our businesses and offer merchandise and tickets for sale. The operation of these web sites and applications may be subject to a range of federal, state, and local laws.

Gaming regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate are established by statute and are administered by a regulatory agency with broad authority to interpret gaming regulations and to regulate gaming activities. Regulatory requirements vary among jurisdictions, but the majority of jurisdictions require licenses, permits, or findings of suitability for our company, individual officers, directors, major stockholders, and key employees. We believe we hold all of the licenses and permits necessary to conduct our business in this space, including IMG ARENA’s business, which provides data and video for more than 45,000 sports events per year to sports betting platforms.
