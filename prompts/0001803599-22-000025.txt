ITEM 1. BUSINESS
We are a leading global provider of Customer Experience (“CX”) solutions and technology that help iconic and disruptive brands drive deep understanding, full lifecycle engagement, and differentiated experiences for their end-customers around the world. We provide end-to-end capabilities, including CX process optimization, technology innovation, front- and back-office automation, analytics and business transformation services to clients in five primary industry verticals. Our differentiated portfolio of solutions support Fortune Global 500 as well as high-growth companies across the globe in their efforts to deliver an optimized, consistent brand experience across all channels of communication, such as voice, chat, email, social media, asynchronous messaging, and custom applications. We strive to deliver exceptional services globally supported by our deep industry knowledge, technology and security practices, talented people, and digital and analytics expertise.
 
We offer our clients integrated solutions supporting the entirety of the customer lifecycle; CX and user experience (“UX”) strategy and design; analytics and actionable insights; and innovative new approaches to enhancing the customer experience through the latest technological advancements in our industry. We are a leader in the shift from traditional Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”), which is focused on a portion of the customer lifecycle, to CX, which supports the entirety of it. Through our end-to-end capabilities, we deliver better economic outcomes for our clients with solutions designed to meet their unique needs as they navigate a landscape characterized by discerning consumers and new market entrants. 
We have strong relationships with companies across the globe and are a partner of choice for industry leaders. We believe in supporting our clients over the long term to build enduring relationships. Our average client tenure is approximately 16 years. As of November 30, 2021, we served over 100 Fortune Global 500 clients as well as more than 115 new economy clients. We primarily support clients in verticals with certain characteristics, such as high growth, high transaction volume, high levels of compliance and security, and steep barriers to entry. Our strategic verticals include technology and consumer electronics, communications and media, retail, travel and e-commerce, banking, financial services and insurance, healthcare, and other. Our clients include:
•7 of the top 10 consumer electronics companies
•4 of the top 5 tech companies
•6 of the top 10 fintech companies
•5 of the top 5 U.S. banks
•3 of the top 5 ecommerce companies
•4 of the top 5 U.S. health insurance companies
•3 of the top 5 2021 global IPOs
•4 of the top 5 social brands
Through our technology-infused offerings, our clients benefit from having a single resource that enables them to address the entirety of the customer journey from acquisition to support to renewal. Our end-to-end capabilities and broad service offerings help our clients acquire, retain, and improve the lifetime value of their customer relationships while optimizing their back-office processes.
We combine global consistency with local expertise, enhancing the end user experience for our clients’ customers through services rendered by a team of approximately 290,000 across approximately 270 locations in more than 40 countries and 6 continents, where we conduct business in over 70 languages. 
On December 27, 2021, we completed our acquisition of PK, a leading CX design engineering company with more than 5,000 staff in four countries. PK creates pioneering experiences that accelerate digital outcomes for their clients’ customers, partners and staff. The acquisition of PK expands our scale in the digital IT services market and supports our growth strategy of investing in digital transformation to deliver exceptional customer experiences. The addition of the PK staff and technology to our team further strengthens our capabilities in CX design and development, artificial intelligence (“AI”), intelligent automation, and customer loyalty.
On December 1, 2020, the previously announced separation (the “separation”) of Concentrix and our technology-infused CX solutions business from SYNNEX Corporation, now known as TD SYNNEX Corporation (“TD SYNNEX”), was completed through a tax-free distribution of all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock to TD SYNNEX stockholders (the “distribution” and, together with the separation, the “spin-off”). TD SYNNEX stockholders received one share of our common stock for each share of TD SYNNEX common stock held as of the close of business on November 17, 2020. As a result of the spin-off, we became an independent public company and our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “CNXC” on December 1, 2020. In connection with the spin-off, on November 30, 2020, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement, an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement and a commercial agreement with TD SYNNEX to set forth the principal actions to be taken in connection with the spin-off and define our ongoing relationship with TD SYNNEX after the spin-off. 
 
We trace our roots back to 2004 when TD SYNNEX acquired BSA Sales, Inc., a company with 20 employees focused on helping clients through outsourced sales and marketing services. In 2006, TD SYNNEX combined New York-based Concentrix with BSA Sales under the Concentrix name, with the goal of bringing technology and innovation into businesses to help clients reimagine and design the next generation of experiences. Concentrix Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in December 2009. 
 Our Market Opportunity
In order to maintain relevancy, our clients must transform their systems in response to increased competition and consumer demands. To meet the evolving needs of their customers, our clients are looking to large CX solutions providers, such as Concentrix, to automate their systems and provide professional support to address complexities beyond the scope of automation. We are a leader in next-generation CX technology driven by a focus on innovation, which we believe will increase our total addressable market as we enter and grow across new and existing markets. 
We offer a unique combination of CX solutions and services at scale. Our suite of integrated solutions include: digital transformation services that design and engineer CX solutions to enable efficient customer self-service and build customer loyalty; customer engagement solutions and services that address the entirety of the customer lifecycle; voice of the customer (“VOC”) solutions to gather and analyze customer feedback to foster loyalty to, and growth with, clients; analytics and consulting solutions that synthesize data and provide professional insight to improve clients’ customer experience strategies; AI technology that can intelligently act on customer intent to improve customer experience with non-human engagement; vertical business process outsourcing (“BPO”) services that provide specialized support to specific industry verticals; and back office BPO services that support clients in non-customer facing areas. 
Industry Trends
•Growing Importance of Customer Experience. We believe customer experience has become a strategic imperative for all enterprises today. Data, analytics, and digital solutions have reshaped the ways firms interact with their customers. As a result, enterprises are modernizing how they manage the customer experience across all channels of communication. The market is evolving from customer relationship management solutions that act as a cost cutting measure toward end-to-end CX management solutions that create value throughout the entire customer lifecycle at an appropriate cost. 
•Empowered Consumers and Users. The modern consumer is discerning and has come to expect a high level of care and responsiveness from their service providers. Old paradigms have shifted as increasingly competitive markets and easily accessible crowd-sourced information have empowered consumers to unprecedented levels. As consumers demand more and have an increasing number of alternatives, companies must differentiate on how they manage their customer relationships. This shift is driving the market toward consumer-centric solutions that reduce customer churn and promote brand loyalty.
•Technological Innovation. Emerging technology is driving change within our industry and shaping the demands of our clients. Advancements in areas such as digital services, AI and machine learning (“ML”) are further disrupting our markets and our clients’ markets while opening new avenues for growth and opportunities for us to better serve our clients. These technologies provide clients the opportunity to interact more effectively with their customers and improve the customer experience by automating processes, optimizing customer journeys to reach faster solutions, enabling personalized engagement across multiple platforms, and focusing human engagement on the most complex interactions. 
•Evolving Role of People. The skill set required of advisors in the CRM and BPO industry is shifting as enterprises place increased importance on CX. Increasing complexity in the voice channel is driving a trend of longer customer engagements requiring CRM and BPO support professionals to have a more robust skill set. The increasing importance of skilled labor in our industry is offset by the transition of low complexity support to online support (self-service), driven by heavy automation and digitization. Despite growth in digital channels, phone conversations currently remain the preferred option for customer services interactions. We believe the human element will continue to be important in our industry, as focus shifts 
 
from routine service to “last-mile” support requiring human-touch to deliver a stronger customer experience. In our view, attracting and retaining skilled talent that can adapt to the evolving focus of customer engagements will require a diverse and inclusive workplace that supports staff wellness. 
•Mission Critical Nature of Cybersecurity. Technological innovation coupled with the proliferation of smart devices and mobile connectivity is generating sensitive data at scale. At the same time, the avenues for access have become numerous, and an increasing number of malicious actors are becoming more sophisticated and active. Data security is paramount in an environment where external intrusion, improper access, or carelessness can compromise customers and businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly expanded the prevalence of CX solutions that rely on remote staff further underscoring the importance of robust data security. Businesses require scalable, industry-leading data protection and security to avoid reputational and operational risks in an environment characterized by the threats and benefits of free-flowing information.
•Enterprise Preferences Driving Vendor Consolidation. Enterprises have become increasingly global. As their scope of business increases, enterprises require a partner that can serve their needs by rapidly deploying solutions and new technology consistently across multiple geographies and channels. Enterprises therefore prefer vendors with scale and end-to-end capabilities that can be a one-stop shop and are consolidating existing relationships to vendors with scale to achieve their business objectives and pursue cost savings. 
•Market Fragmentation Driving Industry Consolidation. We operate in a fragmented marketplace characterized by numerous vendors offering services across various levels of the value chain. Currently the top 10 players in CX only hold an approximate 35% market share with the remaining market share held by thousands of other vendors. As client preferences continue to evolve in line with enterprise preferences, we anticipate that our market will undergo further consolidation. 
•Existing Solutions Have Many Limitations. As executives look to successfully navigate digital transformation and manage their customers’ experience across a wider variety of channels, unsophisticated providers and solutions often fail to meet customers’ needs. Currently there is a limited set of providers with end-to-end, global offerings of scale in the marketplace. The fragmentation of the market and, for many industries, high regulatory hurdles create additional complexity as most providers are small, niche, or local players. These issues are compounded by a lack of sufficient investment in cybersecurity, creating exposure to regulatory, reputational, and operational risks. These pain points, coupled with the prevalence of providers offering legacy solutions that fail to address the demands of the modern consumer, create an opportunity for large-scale, global CX solutions providers.
Our CX Solutions and Technology
Through our strategy, talent and technology, we offer solutions that help our clients enhance the experience for their customers and improve business performance. Our CX solutions encompass our core service offering of Customer Lifecycle Management and three complementary areas: CX/UX Strategy and Design; Digital Transformation; and VOC and Analytics.

We help our clients by creating tools that their customers and employees love to use, enable better customer interactions through real-time sentiment analysis, and integrate multiple customer interactions and touchpoints into one-stop smart mobile applications. We provide these solutions and other complementary services in 70 languages, across 6 continents, from approximately 270 locations in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA. 
Customer Lifecycle Management. We seek to deliver next-generation customer engagement solutions and services that address the entirety of the customer lifecycle. We offer our clients the means to acquire, support and renew customers across all channels while minimizing attrition and increasing customer lifetime value. Our Customer Lifecycle Management solutions include services such as customer care, sales support, digital marketing, technical support, digital self-service, content moderation, creative design and content production, and back office 
 
services. Customer Lifecycle Management represents our core service offering and a significant majority of the services we provide. 
In addition to our Customer Lifecycle Management services, we also provide the complementary services described below, which are provided to clients as integrated solutions with our core service offering:
•CX/UX Strategy and Design. We strive to help our clients reimagine what great is, designing next generation CX solutions to exceed customer expectations. Our CX/UX Strategy and Design solutions, including CX strategy, data-driven user design, journey mapping, and multi-platform engineering, enable our clients to create effortless, personalized customer engagements and align business priorities around measurable goals. Through these services, which we expanded with our acquisition of PK, we promote a more rapid integration of digital and enabling technologies, providing transformational business services to our clients. 
•Digital Transformation. We seek to offer cutting edge solutions to reshape how brands better engage with their customers. Our innovative solutions and services are focused on creating disruption to help our clients stay relevant and achieve better business outcomes. Our Digital Transformation solutions include services such as Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”) and cognitive automation that automate processes to improve efficiency and accuracy, mobile app development to solve business challenges through new channels of customer engagement, work-at-home and gig platforms that capitalize on a changing and flexible workforce, Interactive Voice Response (“IVR”) and natural language understanding solutions that improve outcomes and customer experience with automated responses to verbal interactions, messaging and social platforms that allow clients to engage with customers across myriad platforms, and system integration services. Our acquisition of PK added breadth and scale to our digital transformation services, further strengthening our capabilities in CX design and development, AI, intelligent automation, and customer loyalty. 
•Voice of the Customer and Analytics.  ConcentrixCX, our VOC solutions platform, helps turn customer feedback into actionable insights. Our Analytics solutions provide businesses with insight into rapidly changing markets through data, which provides our clients with a competitive edge. Our VOC and Analytics solutions include offerings such as VOC Essentials, our VOC SaaS platform, speech and text insights, sentiment analysis, advanced analytics and real-time reporting.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and provide us with a competitive advantage:
•Market Leader with a Differentiated Brand and Value Proposition: We strive to have a compelling brand and reputation as a leading provider of solutions and technology that shape the customer experience. We have a differentiated combination of global scale, local reach, technological expertise, end-to-end solution capabilities and full lifecycle services. We are widely recognized as a leading provider of CX solutions and technology, garnering industry attention via 86 industry awards in fiscal year 2021. Third-party researchers have also taken note of our leading global practice with Everest Group Research distinguishing us as a leader for the 6th time, recognizing us as a company with high buyer satisfaction, strong vision and strategy, portfolio mix, innovation and investment and scope of services.
•Strong Relationships with a Growing and Diversified Client Base: We provide CX solutions for over 750 clients worldwide. Leading global companies, including more than 100 Fortune Global 500 brands and more than 125 new economy clients, rely upon our solutions and technology. We serve a wide variety of clients, extending across numerous verticals. Our end-to-end capabilities and global scale have enabled us to build long-lasting relationships with our clients spanning approximately 16 years on average. Our commitment to our clients is our primary focus and has generated numerous accolades to date, including 54 client awards in fiscal year 2021.
 
•Extensive Global Presence: We operate globally in over 40 countries across 6 continents with the ability to conduct business in 70 different languages. We believe we are well-positioned to serve the largest global brands in nearly every market in which they operate. Our global footprint includes a strong presence in emerging markets such as India, China, Brazil, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, which provides an opportunity to grow with our clients in these regions. Our ability to create value for our clients across a global delivery platform has enabled us to be a partner of choice. 
•Continued Investment in Research and Development: We believe that our investment in technology differentiates us from our competitors. We have provided technology-infused CX solutions for longer than a decade. We have been at the forefront of developing CX solutions and technology that improve the customer experience and will continue to strive for this in the future. Our acquisition of PK, a leading CX design engineering company, demonstrates our commitment to being a leader in CX technology and digital transformation. 
We have been a leader in our industry in advancements such as conversational virtual assistants, multichannel and augmented CRM, predictive analytics, emotion analytics, cognitive learning and AI and enjoy a first mover advantage. We are also an industry leader in cybersecurity best practices. We believe our strong focus on innovation has enabled us to maximize value for our clients and made it harder for our competitors to compete with us. Due to our size and scale, and the regular implementation of technology as part of our CX solutions, our costs of developing, maintaining and integrating new technologies are not material on a stand-alone basis.
•Track Record of Sustainable Organic Growth: We have an established track record of long-term organic revenue growth, and we believe we will continue to enjoy sustainable growth while rebalancing our portfolio from acquisitions as a result of:
•Nature of our offerings
•Substantial switching costs for our clients
•High net revenue retention rates 
•Strong barriers to entry in the CX solutions market
•Large and expanding addressable market
•Demonstrated History of Strategic Acquisitions: We have acquired and integrated more than 15 companies since our inception. We have a demonstrated ability to turn around underutilized assets and maximize their value, which we believe allows us to explore a broader scope of opportunities than our peers. In December 2021, we acquired PK, which expands our scale in the digital IT services market and supports our growth strategy of investing in digital transformation to deliver exceptional customer experiences.
•Corporate Culture Committed to Our Clients’ Success: Our unified team allows us to deliver consistent and exceptional results. As of November 30, 2021, our team consisted of approximately 290,000 staff globally. We enjoy high staff engagement because of a strong company culture that is fanatical about serving our clients through integrity, with bold and disruptive thought. We strive for diversity and inclusion in the workplace and emphasize staff wellness and mental health. We believe this supportive environment reinforces the commitment of our team, empowers our staff to make an impact on our global community, and drives better customer experiences and improved outcomes for our clients. 
•Experienced Management Team: Our passionate and committed management team is led by industry experts with a deep understanding of our clients’ needs. We have a highly talented management team with significant experience in the CX industry, with our senior leadership team having an average of more than 30 years of experience. Through our acquisitions we have benefited from the addition of management talent, who have contributed valuable new perspectives and insights. Under our tenured management team, we have grown our revenue from $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2014 to $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2021, while delivering strong profitability.
 
Our Growth Strategy 
The key elements to our growth strategy are: 
•Expand and Deepen Relationships with Existing Clients: We have a well-established track record of cross-selling and offering additional solutions and premium services to sustain and grow our relationships with our existing clients. We have historically focused on clients with high transaction volume on a recurring basis, fast growing verticals, and large enterprises, and will continue to do so. We believe our scale, efficiency, and technology generates incremental value for our clients with each process we manage, naturally driving our customers to spend more with us. We believe our focus on technology innovation and responding to our clients’ needs positions us for continued growth. 
•Relentlessly Innovate and Develop New Digital Services and Solutions: We have developed innovative solutions for our clients, and we are focused on investing in technology. Investment in CX solutions technologies and digital transformation can enable more effective engagement with customers and improve the customer experience through increased automation, optimize customer journeys to reach faster solutions, enable personalized engagement across multiple platforms, and focus human engagement on the most complex interactions. For these reasons, we believe investments in disruptive technologies, applications, and services, such as our acquisition of PK, will continue to be instrumental in driving better value for our clients and result in increased profitability.
•Further Expand into Adjacent Markets: Our marketplace continues to expand beyond CRM BPO. We see significant opportunity for growth across adjacent markets, and we strengthened our presence in the digital IT services market by acquiring PK. We intend to continue to provide our clients with an integrated offering of solutions that include digital services, VOC solutions, analytics and consulting, AI technology, vertical BPO services and back office BPO services. To further capitalize on new market adjacencies, we have made significant investments across emerging technologies such as RPA, AI, ML, VOC, IVR, and Internet of Things (“IoT”), which we believe will enhance our clients’ ability to offer personalized, effective engagement in all customer interactions to increase customer satisfaction and promote brand loyalty. As our industry evolves, we will continue to invest in these new and fast growing markets to further sustain long-term growth.
•Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions: We have made targeted acquisitions to increase our technology expertise, enter new verticals and geographies, and increase our scale, including the IBM Customer Care Business, Convergys and PK. Our market remains highly fragmented and we believe that our acquisition strategy enhances and augments our growth avenues. We intend to continue to evaluate and pursue complementary, value enhancing acquisitions. 
•Invest in Emerging Markets: We have invested in delivery operations in emerging, high-growth markets such as India, China, Brazil, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. We expect to continue to invest in similar markets to be well-positioned to serve global brands and enable us to grow with our clients in the regions and countries where they are growing.
Our Customers
In fiscal year 2021, we served more than 750 clients across various verticals and geographies. Our strategic verticals include: technology and consumer electronics, communications and media, retail, travel and e-commerce, banking, financial services and insurance, healthcare and other. We focus on developing long-term, strategic relationships with clients in verticals with certain characteristics, such as high growth, high transaction volume, high levels of compliance and security, and steep barriers to entry.
Sales and Marketing
We market our services through a sales force organized by industry vertical and geography. The length of our selling cycle varies depending on the type of engagement. Our efforts may begin in response to our lead generation 
 
program, a perceived opportunity, a reference by an existing client, a request for proposal or otherwise. The sales cycle varies depending on the type of services work as well as whether there is an existing relationship with the client.
We have designated client partners or global relationship managers for each of our strategic relationships. The relationship manager is supported by process improvement, quality, transition, finance, human resources, information technology and industry or subject matter expert teams to ensure the best possible solution is provided to our clients.
We also strive to foster relationships between our senior leadership team and our clients’ senior management. These “C-level” relationships ensure that both parties are focused on establishing priorities, aligning objectives and driving client value from the top down. High-level executive relationships have been particularly constructive as a means of increasing business from our existing clients. It also provides us with a forum for addressing client concerns. We constantly measure our client satisfaction levels to ensure that we maintain high service levels for each client.
Our Operations
We have global delivery capabilities that allow us to scale our operations with people and other resources from around the world, including language fluency, proximity to clients and time-zone advantages. A critical component of this capability is our approximately 270 locations in more than 40 countries throughout the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA. Our service delivery centers improve the efficiency of our engagement teams through the reuse of processes, solution designs and infrastructure by leveraging the experience of delivery center professionals. Services are provided from these global locations to customers worldwide in multiple languages. These services are supported by proprietary and third-party technologies to enable efficient and secure customer contact through various channels including voice, chat, web, email, social media and other digital platforms. All of our delivery centers and data centers are subject to annual certifications and attestations that include Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) version 3.2.1, ISO 27001:2013 and SOC2 Type II. Twenty-eight of our delivery centers around the world are certified to the COPC (Customer Operation Performance Center) Outsource Service Provider standard. For our healthcare clients, we have achieved HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) 9.3 certification. We also maintain a Level 3 CMMI version 1.3 certification for services and development for our major technology development centers globally. 
We also have the capability to provide services for our clients through our utilization of remote staff. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly expanded the prevalence of CX solutions that rely on utilization of remote staff, and as of November 30, 2021, more than 60% of our global team was remote. Our SecureCXTM platform supports secure remote work environments through digital tools and technology that authenticate the remote advisor, restrict unauthorized personnel and devices, and deliver real-time alerting of attempts to circumvent control.
We operate a globally distributed data processing environment that can seamlessly connect and integrate our service delivery centers with our data centers and points of presence. Our technologically advanced and secured data centers provide availability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with redundant power and communication feeds and emergency power back-up, and are designed to withstand most natural disasters.
The capacity of our data center and service delivery center operations, our nimble approach to remote staff, and the scalability of our customer management solutions enable us to meet the dynamic and challenging needs of large-scale and rapidly growing companies and government entities. By leveraging our scale and efficiencies across our common system platforms, we can provide rapid client-specific enhancements and modifications at competitive costs, which positions us as a value-added provider of customer support products and services.
International Operations
Approximately 84% of our revenue is generated by our non-U.S. operations. A key element in our business strategy has been to locate our service delivery centers in markets that are strategic to our client requirements and 
 
cost beneficial. We have significant operations in the Philippines and India, as well as throughout Europe and the Americas.
Sales and cost concentrations in international jurisdictions subject us to various risks, including the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which in turn can impact reported revenues and cost of revenues.
See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional financial information related to our international and domestic operations.
Seasonality
Our revenue and margins fluctuate with the underlying trends in our clients’ businesses. As a result, our revenues and margins are typically the highest in our fourth fiscal quarter.
Information Technology
We invest in IT systems, infrastructure, automation and security to enhance workforce management and enhance productivity. Our CX delivery centers employ a broad range of technology, including digital switching, intelligent call routing and tracking, proprietary workforce management systems, case management tools, computer telephony integration, interactive voice response and advanced speech recognition, with embedded security. Our innovative use of technology enables us to improve our voice, chat, web and e-mail handling and personnel scheduling, thereby increasing our efficiency and enhancing the quality of the services we deliver to our clients and their customers. We are able to dynamically scale to respond to changes in our clients’ business volumes. Additionally, we use technology to collect information for our clients about the interactions to support quality of service and improve the customer journey.
To support data security, we have established an integrated risk management framework with practices that are derived from industry standards, including ISO 31000, ISO 27001, HITRUST, PCI DSS and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and data privacy regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The data security controls from these standards and regulations are evaluated for our risk management framework based on the needs of our business and our clients, the nature of our industry, and applicable regulations. 
Competition
Our major competitors include core CX solutions competitors, including Majorel Group Luxembourg S.A., Sitel Group, TaskUs Inc., TDCX Inc., Teleperformance S.A., TELUS International, TTEC Holdings, Inc., and Webhelp SAS, other CX solutions competitors that primarily provide complementary services such as consulting and design, IT services, business process services, VOC and analytics, including Accenture plc, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, ExlService Holdings, Inc., Genpact Limited, Medallia, Inc., Qualtrics, LLC, and WNS (Holdings) Limited, and digital IT services competitors, including Endava UK Ltd., EPAM Systems, Inc., Globant S.A. and Thoughtworks, Holding, Inc.
In the future, we may face greater competition due to the consolidation of CX solutions providers. Consolidation activity may result in competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or more attractive pricing than ours. In addition, a client or potential client may choose not to outsource its business, by setting up captive outsourcing operations or performing formerly outsourced services for themselves, or may switch CX solutions providers.
Human Capital Resources
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that attracts and retains exceptional talent. Through ongoing staff development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety and staff wellbeing, we strive to help our team in all aspects of their lives so they can do their best work. 
As of November 30, 2021, we had approximately 290,000 full-time staff, of which approximately 60,000 were based in the Americas, approximately 200,000 were based in Asia-Pacific, and approximately 30,000 were based in EMEA. Except for a small portion of our team in certain countries, generally required by local regulations or brought in through acquisitions, our staff are not represented by a labor union, nor are they covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
A diverse team, including across background, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and lived experiences, is critical to our success and contributes to a work environment that promotes bold and contrarian thinking and an entrepreneurial mindset. We strive to create an inclusive workplace where people can bring their authentic selves to work. Our staff are encouraged to leverage their personal strengths and experiences to continually innovate and contribute to the development of new ideas and process improvements that drive better customer experiences and improved outcomes for our clients. Our Code of Ethical Business Conduct requires all of our staff to adhere to our dedication to an inclusive work environment that fosters respect for all of our team members. 
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts with our highly skilled and diverse board of directors and senior leadership team. More than half of the members of our board of directors and approximately 40% of our senior leadership team are women, and approximately 25% of our board and senior leadership team are ethnic minorities. In 2020, Concentrix strengthened its commitment to diversity by creating the role of Senior Director of Community and Culture to lead efforts for staff experience, diversity, equity and inclusion, wellbeing, and global citizenship. In 2021, we offered virtual learning opportunities on diversity, equity and inclusion topics that were attended by several thousands of our staff. Our team has also opened LGBTQ+, persons with disabilities, women and black professionals staff resource groups to support a diverse and inclusive workplace. In 2020 and 2021, our Chief Executive Officer, Chris Caldwell, was named one of the ten best CEOs for Women and one of the ten best CEOs for Diversity by Comparably, a workplace culture and compensation website.
Pay Equity and Total Rewards
People should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as a team member’s role and experience, the location of their job, and their performance. We also review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual team members, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable. We have reviewed the compensation of our staff to ensure consistent pay practices by conducting a gender pay equity analysis comparing staff in the same role within a country or location.
We require a uniquely talented workforce and are committed to providing total rewards that are market-competitive and performance based, driving innovation and operational excellence. Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance that aligns with and drives long-term stockholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent.
Staff Engagement
We pride ourselves on being fanatical about our staff. Our company culture emphasizes the satisfaction and well-being of our staff and a diverse, engaged team. We regularly solicit the opinion and views of our staff through a staff satisfaction survey, the results of which inform key initiatives to support engagement and foster retention. The 
 
global participation rate for our most recent staff satisfaction survey in 2021 was more than 85%, and our overall positive engagement rating (staff members that gave a satisfaction score of 4 or 5) was 83%. 
Training and Development
Human capital development underpins our efforts to execute our strategy and continue to deliver exceptional services globally. We invest in staff career growth and provide our team with a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development. Front-line staff receive continual feedback and reinforcement from supervisors who provide coaching, often in real time, so that staff can more readily apply their training to assist our clients and their customers. In addition, our staff have access to more than 16,400 online courses and 700 learning paths through Concentrix University to develop skills specific to their current roles and promote ongoing career growth.
Health, Safety and Wellness
The physical health, financial stability, life balance and mental health of our team is vital to our success. We sponsor a wellness program designed to enhance physical, financial, and mental well-being for all of our staff. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, wellness challenges, and other incentives. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken an integrated approach to helping our staff manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on mental health. We also successfully transitioned a significant portion of our workforce to a remote working environment and implemented a number of safety and social distancing measures in our sites to protect the health and safety of our team. We are focused on supporting access to COVID-19 vaccines for our staff around the world. In 2021, we committed to provide our staff in the Philippines and India with free COVID-19 vaccines, and we delivered on that commitment with voluntary vaccination programs that were also made available to staff family members in the Philippines.
Sustainability
We have a responsibility to improve the lives of our people and the health of our planet. In 2020, we began work on a formal Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) program, and we released our first Sustainability Report in 2021, our first year as a public company. Our ESG program seeks to use our global reach and the strength of our team of approximately 290,000 to further three priorities:
•Care for the environment to leave it better than we found it;
•Create a better place for people to work and live in the communities where we operate; and 
•Act with integrity and do the right thing.
Our 2021 Sustainability Report outlines our ESG commitments for 2025 and how these commitments align with the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations. We will continue to report on our progress with respect to these commitments in future Sustainability Reports.
