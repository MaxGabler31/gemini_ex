ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History and Background

Overview

We are an emerging health and wellness company that has identified the need for a change to healthcare, where conventional medicine and alternative healing can both be drawn on to provide a world of integrated healing encompassing conventional medicine and alternative medicine.  

Our intent is to build a community of integrated healing brands by identifying and acquiring early stage, high potential brands within selected wellness categories.  Our plan is to build individual market impact through enhanced branding, a credible narrative, social conversation and improved accessibility by positioning all portfolio brands with a larger “healing community” of brands thus building exponential market impact.

In order to attain these goals during the period covered by this report, management entered into various contracts with employees and consultants all of whom have experience in marketing, wellness and health fields.  With the acquisition of NOEO (discussed below), and the recent onboarding of a management team to undertake our operations, we have commenced operations in the health and wellness sector.

Term Loans anticipated to be funded under the Agreement will be in a minimum principal amount of at least $400,000, bear an annual interest rate of 12% and will mature the earlier of 12 months following the final draw down under a Term Loan and a date on which an event of default, as defined in the Agreement, occurs. Term Loans will be repayable in full on their maturity dates and may be voluntarily prepaid in full (but not in part) at the option of the Company and prepaid on a mandatory basis on the sale of the assets underlying a particular Term Loan. Interest on any outstanding Term Loans will be paid monthly. The Company paid an upfront fee of $562,500 to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and will pay the Administrative Agent, for its own account, a quarterly fee of $12,500.

The Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, HLCO Borrower, LLC to facilitate this agreement.

The Company has been negotiating a number of potential acquisitions, one of which has been with Your Super, Inc. and its indirectly wholly owned subsidiary, Your Superfoods, Inc, Delaware corporations (together, the “Your Super Companies”).  On September 9, 2022, the Company entered into a loan purchase and sale agreement (the “Agreement”) with CircleUp Credit Advisors LLC (the “Seller”) pursuant to which it agreed to purchase from the Seller all loans and loan accommodations (the “Loan”) made by the Seller to the Your Super Companies.

This Warrant will begin to vest on the one-year anniversary of the closing of the purchase of the Loan with 12.5% of the Warrant amount (187,500 shares) vesting on that date and the remaining portion of the Warrant vesting in seven quarterly installments of 187,500 shares each over the next seven quarters. Vesting of the Warrant will be accelerated upon the occurrence of a sale or merger of the Company. The Warrant will terminate on the seventh anniversary of the closing date and will be subject to customary adjustments of the warrant price and number of shares for splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like.  As of the date of the Agreement, the outstanding principal amount of the Loan along with accrued but unpaid interest was approximately $7.614 million. The Loan stopped accruing interest on July 22, 2022.  The Company purchased the Loan to provide additional time for the negotiation of the Company’s possible acquisition of the assets of Your Super Inc.

The Company has entered into negotiations to acquire a health supplements company that is on a mission to significantly improve the lives of everyone it reaches.  With focus on nutritional balance, transparency of ingredients, and optimizing of quality and efficacy, this strategic acquisition, if consummated, would allow the Company to expand its capabilities across both current and future brands.  This target acquisition reported approximately $10 million in gross revenue last year, with strong profitability.  The Company also expects to conclude this transaction during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, however, the transaction will be subject to the finalization of negotiations, several material closing conditions and the completion of a due diligence investigation and there can be no assurance that this transaction will be consummated. 

The Company intends to build a community of integrated healing brands by identifying and acquiring early stage, high potential brands within selected wellness categories.  Our plan is to build individual market impact through enhanced branding, a credible narrative, social conversation and improved accessibility by positioning.  Our first acquisition was of NOEO, a company involved in direct-to-consumer brand focusing on adaptogenic herbs, and we are currently negotiating on a number of further acquisitions.  

Current Operations - NOEO GmbH

Company Information

NOEO, our wholly owned subsidiary, is a company incorporated pursuant to the laws of Germany which commenced operations in early 2021 through direct-to-consumer sales of certain branded CDB oils and adaptogen products including mushroom complexes in the form of capsules. NOEO was originally founded by Greenstein Nutraceuticals Ltd. (“Greenstein), a German corporation also co-founded by Ms. Anabel Oelmann, a recently appointed director of our Company, and a certified nutritionist and health coach. Based on her passion for making alternative medicine more accessible, Ms. Oelmann founded NOEO for Greenstein, and subsequently acquired the shares of NOEO, including products marketed under the NOEO brand, certain formulations and recipes, trademarks and domains in a purchase and sale contract dated March 25, 2021. In March 2022, Ms. Oelmann and the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement whereby the Company purchased NOEO in its entirety after Ms. Oelmann divested all inventory and IP rights relating to NOEO’s CBD line of products. NOEO offers three fully developed and marketable adaptogen products under the NOEO brand as more particularly described below, the domain www.noeo.co and certain trademarks as well as any product existing inventory. The Company intends to immediately undertake the ongoing sales of the recently acquired NOEO products, as well as enhanced marketing efforts to bring recognition to the brand across a wider consumer base. In line with the Company’s mandate to identify and acquire unique opportunities in naturally derived supplements, medicines, and alternative therapies, the Company may also undertake future product development to further expand its current product line and branded offerings. NOEO was originally created with the aim of providing daily wellness through natural and herbal-based products, and the Company will continue to foster that mission.

On July 27, 2022, the Company incorporated a Nevada Corporation, NOEO, Inc. and intends to transfer the assets of NOEO GMBH to the Nevada corporation where it will undertake the expansion of the NOEO business. Currently the Company is in the process of rebranding the NOEO product line in accordance with North American labeling standards and best practices.

Our key product components are functional mushrooms:

What is Reishi? 

The Reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum) is an Asian natural remedy against a lot of ailments. It has been used for over 4,000 years and is also known as ‘mushroom for immortality.’ Traditional Chinese medicine claims that the Reishi is the most powerful resource for sustaining human health in all its forms. 
What is Chaga? 

The Chaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus) is a parasite mushroom that grows exclusively on birch trees. Its origin is northeastern areas like the Baltics, Scandinavian countries, and Russia. However, Chaga can be found in Europe too. Chaga has been around for a long time in traditional nomads and Chinese medicine, it has various interesting qualities. The mushroom was mainly used as a tonic to balance the body functions. The high melatonin content, for example, helps to keep a healthy sleep-wake rhythm and improves the quality of sleep as well. It has high antioxidant potential and helps to protect the skin because of compounds like betulin and beta-glucan. It calms the guts and can help get rid of stomach issues faster. 

10

What is Shiitake? 

Also called the king of the mushrooms, Shiitake (Lentinula edodes) is already used for over 2,000 years and cultivated in eastern Asia since around 1.000 CE. Next to its medical value, it has an excellent taste and is often used in Asian dishes. The main effect of Shiitake is the perfectly balanced impact on the intestinal flora. Shiitake has a strong antimicrobial effect on harmful bacteria while simultaneously not acting against the beneficial intestinal bacteria like bifido- and lactic bacteria and helps rehabilitating the intestines. Additionally, Shiitake is an amazing mushroom for the regulation of lipid metabolism. It can help lowering cholesterol levels in the blood. 
What is Maitake? 

After the cultivation of Maitake (Grifola frondosa) was successful in the 1980s, the mushroom started its triumphal march around the world. Before, a legend states that Maitake was extremely rare, that when foragers found one, they danced of happiness. Hence, the nickname ‘dancing mushroom.’ Maitake can have a tremendous anti-diabetic effect caused by a specific glycoprotein that raises glucose tolerance while not affecting the insulin level. The potential to decrease blood sugar levels was also discovered in the mushroom, hence Maitake can be used as a preventive measure against diabetic risks. By influencing the renin-angiotensin-system Maitake can help lower high blood pressure and reduce the storage of fat into the tissue. 

What is Lion’s Mane/Hieracium erinaceous?

Lion’s mane mushrooms, also known as hou tou gu or yamabushitake, are large, white, shaggy mushrooms that resemble a lion’s mane as they grow.  With both culinary and medical uses they can be enjoyed raw, cooked, dried or steeped as a tea and contain bioactive substances that are believed to have beneficial effects on the body, especially the brain, heart and gut. Key benefits associated with Lion’s Mane are protection against dementia, relieve of mild symptoms of depression and/or anxiety, reduced risk of heart disease, protection against ulcers and improved management of symptoms of diabetes, among other benefits. 

What is Cordyceps?

Cordyceps mushrooms are grown throughout the world. Though technically classified as entomopathogenic fungi, and not mushrooms, meaning that in nature, they grow as parasites on insects, there are two varieties of Cordyceps that have been extensively researched for their significant health and wellness properties. Cordyceps are recognized for their ability to support vitality, endurance, and stamina as a result of the naturally occurring compounds in the mushroom that are believed to improve the availability of oxygen in the blood.  Used extensively in traditional Chinese and Tibetan medicine, Cordyceps is believed to be a vitality elixir that combats illness, improves stamina and increases longevity. 
What is Auricularia?

Auricularia or “Wood Ear” mushrooms have also been a staple in Traditional Chinese Medicine for thousands of years. A mushroom species with a tough, gelatinous, elastic texture often resembling the appearance of an ear, Auricularia is bright reddish brown with a purplish tint.  The genus Auricularia is comprised of 10–15 recognized species worldwide and believed to help improve blood circulation, reduce inflammation and improve heart health. Secondary benefits are believed to include potential antioxidant properties reducing the risk of chronic diseases and detoxifying the body. 
What are Adaptogens?

It is possible to protect your body from both physical and mental stress by improving your tolerance level towards exhaustion. Adaptogens, as the name itself hints, are non-toxic plants that help the body adapt to stress. This can be all kinds of stress, whether it is physical, chemical, or biological. Especially current young professionals experience higher stress levels than previous generations, partly due to rushing lifestyles, tighter schedules and increasing competition. Adaptogens, also known as adaptogenic herbs, are not new. They have been used in Ayurvedic and Chinese traditional healing methods but have now gained popularity among the global health and wellness community.

Stress is a physiological condition, that is associated with the nervous, endocrine (hormones) and immune system. It can be an external event, environmental condition or a chemical or biological agent that triggers the body to release various hormones that result in physiological changes. A person’s response to stress that is not adequate, or too overwhelming or long term can have serious damage on the body such as disease or even death. This is referred to maladaptive stress, and it is what adaptogens are said to help the body to overcome.

 Are adaptogens effective?

There is a range of adaptogens, each with a specific function. Their function with the human body can be compared to regular exercise. Each time you exercise your muscles adapt to the stress they experience and thus become stronger. Similarly, adaptogens interact with the pituitary gland, adrenal gland and hypothalamus to build resistance and improve the coping system of the body. A continuous treatment with these natural herbs helps the body achieve homeostasis and ensures the functioning of your immune and energy levels.

As a natural remedy, adaptogens can be added to your diet in various ways. You can add pre-mixed powders to your meals, drink adaptogen teas or take them in the form of supplements. Supplements are pre-measured capsules that have the advantage of providing the precise amount that your body needs. It is important to understand that adaptogens function best as an extension to a mindful and healthy lifestyle. If you do not take any other measures to managing your chronic stress, adaptogens will not provide you with the solution you are hoping to get.

 Do adaptogens have side effects?

Always consult a doctor before introducing adaptogens to your diet or routine. There are some studies that suggest that common herbal supplements may interact negatively with prescription medications.

However, there is little evidence to suggest that adaptogens can cause side effects, though like any plant, they can be allergenic.

Competition and Market Position

The Company plans to invest significantly in strengthening our NOEO brand in the global marketplace. We face competition from many other companies in this sector that are larger and better capitalized than we are. As we are fairly new to the market, and there are other companies that are vertically integrated we will need to grow substantially to gain market position for our products.

Competition in the field of mushroom supplements include a variety of options including powders, capsules, teas and other blends. Certain select competitors in the space include: MUD/MTR, FourSigmatic, Now Foods, Your Super, Vital Plan, ONNIT and Goldmine, not to mention all major vitamin and supplement brands such as Jamieson, Garden of Life and Pure Encapsulations, and many more.

Development

The Company is in the process of relocating the operations of NOEO to the United States. 

Government Regulations

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices that may affect our business in each of the jurisdictions into which we sell our NOEO products. The safety, formulation, manufacturing, processing, packaging, importation, labeling, promotion, advertising and distribution of products we sell direct to consumer are potentially subject to regulation by several government agencies, including the German Food Supplements Regulation (NemV) and the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL); in the European Union the European Food Safety Authority (“EFSA”), and Food Supplements directive 2002/46/EC as well as other potential European regulatory bodies, in United States, the Food and Drug Administration, the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA), as well as by various state and local agencies. In Canada our products are considered Natural Health Products and regulated under the Food and Drugs Act. In all markets regulation of dietary supplements may include regulation of dietary ingredients, labeling and current good manufacturing practices, which includes quality control, packaging and labeling regulations. Claims and promotional statements describing how a product affects the structure, function and general well-being of the body require adequate scientific evidence to support the claim and no statement may expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, treat or prevent a disease

In addition, advertising for dietary supplements in all markets will have various rules and regulations including guidance and protocols for product claims, claims about whether product packaging is recyclable or compostable, as well as deceptive advertising methods. Governing bodies in all jurisdictions have the ability to levy monetary sanctions and impose penalties that could severely limit a company’s business practices in the event of noncompliance. Of key importance is adequate substantiation for all claims made in advertising to avoid the use of false or misleading advertising claims.

As is common in our industry, we rely on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and statutory requirements. In general, we seek certifications of compliance, representations and warranties, indemnification and insurance from our suppliers and contract manufacturers if available. However, even with adequate certifications, representations and warranties, insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in the products we sell. In addition, the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or withdraw such products from our stores. In order to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, our suppliers and contract manufacturers have from time to time reformulated, eliminated or relabeled certain of their products and we have revised certain provisions of our sales and marketing program.

New or revised federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our business or our industry, such as those relating to adaptogenic products could result in additional compliance costs.

Environmental Regulations

We are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits, licenses or approvals that have been issued with respect to our operations. We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our business, and at this time, we do not anticipate incurring any material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or other requirements.

While our intended projects and business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
