History
The Company was founded in 1978, incorporated as IXI, Inc. in Minnesota in February 1987 and changed its name to Rimage Corporation in April 1988. Until October 2011, the Company focused its business on the development and sale of its CD recordable publishing systems and DVD recordable publishing systems.

In October 2011, the Company acquired Qumu, Inc., a leader in the enterprise video content management software market and changed its name to Qumu Corporation in September 2013. Qumu completed the transition to an enterprise video content management software company in July 2014, when the Company closed on the sale of its disc publishing assets to Equus Holdings, Inc. and Redwood Acquisition, Inc. 
In October 2014, the Company acquired Kulu Valley Ltd., a private limited company incorporated and operating in England and Wales, subsequently renamed Qumu Ltd (“Kulu Valley”). The acquisition was made to expand Qumu’s addressable market through the offering of Kulu Valley’s best-in-class video content creation capabilities and easy-to-deploy pure cloud solution, while providing customers with access to industry-leading video content management and delivery capability.
Enterprise Video Content Management and Delivery Software
To increase communication, engagement and collaboration between employees and stakeholders, organizations are continuing to focus on technology investments that improve the engagement and connectivity of people across offices, conference rooms, computers, tablets and smart phones. As part of this shift in technology investment, enterprises are quickly moving to video as the primary communication and collaboration medium.
Qumu is the leading provider of best-in-class tools to create, manage, secure, distribute and measure the success of live and on-demand video for the enterprise. As a trusted adviser to clients and partners, Qumu is the innovation leader when scalability, reliability and security are critical. Backed by the most talented and experienced team in the industry, the Qumu platform enables global organizations to drive employee engagement, increase access to video, and modernize the workplace by providing a more efficient and effective way to share knowledge.
The world’s largest organizations leverage the Qumu platform for a variety of cloud, on-premise or hybrid deployments. Use cases include executive webcasting, corporate communications, training and onboarding, employee collaboration, external sales, marketing communications, iPTV and digital signage.
Qumu provides an end-to-end solution with an intuitive and rich user experience to create, manage and deliver live and on-demand video content both behind and beyond the secure firewall. 
Capabilities and Products
The Qumu Enterprise Video Platform 
Qumu offers an end-to-end video creation, management and delivery solution for enterprises. The solution can be purchased as a perpetual software license or software as a service (SaaS) for cloud or hybrid deployments. The Qumu platform offers a scalable and extensible platform that organizations can use to improve stakeholders' engagement both internally and externally. 
Qumu’s implementations can range in size from thousands to millions of dollars. The Qumu platform integrates with customers' existing video services (e.g., videoconferencing systems), business applications (e.g., Skype, WebEx, Zoom, Outlook) and broader IT infrastructures using Qumu's extensive application services or "APIs." Deployments also range from a single customer location to a global infrastructure serving over one hundred thousand corporate employees. Qumu’s solution components are deployed as needed to serve different capabilities of the enterprise video content lifecycle of creating, capturing, managing, delivering and experiencing video content.
The Qumu platform offers a flexible deployment model that can be leveraged by organizations in three different ways: 

• | Inside the firewall as an on-premise enterprise-grade solution


• | Outside of the firewall as a cloud-based solution


• | As a hybrid solution, providing the flexibility of cloud, combined with Qumu’s intelligent delivery technology.

The Qumu platform encompasses four distinct elements:

• | Video Capture


• | Video Content Management


• | Intelligent Delivery


• | Extensions and Add-Ons

Video Capture
Qumu’s intelligent video capture (sometimes referred to as ingest) dynamically supports unlimited video content sources, accommodating a wide variety of video formats. Video conferencing solutions have emerged as a rapidly growing source of

video content. These range from high-end, hardware-intensive conference room systems, such as those provided by Polycom and Cisco, to popular unified communications solutions such as Skype for Business, Zoom and WebEx.
Qumu brings streaming and management to these video communications tools. As video conferencing becomes the de facto form of team communication, organizations can record, manage and broadcast these videos live or on demand to hundreds or thousands of employees. Intelligent video capture allows users to record and broadcast using existing video conferencing tools. With one enterprise-wide video management and delivery platform, IT can extend their existing video conferencing system investment and concurrently move forward with new unified communications strategies.
Video Content Management
Organizations use Qumu to centrally manage all live and on-demand corporate video content through a single interface. Qumu's video content management allows system users to ingest video, create metadata and share content quickly and securely to endpoints with rights and rules management. Some of the platform’s notable functionality includes: 
Creation & Editing
The Qumu platform provides comprehensive, easy-to-use tools to create and edit video from desktop and mobile devices or using conference room and studio systems. The tools can be used across a wide range of applications from creating a simple mobile phone presentation, to editing a video conference recording, to producing a multi-camera town hall event. 
Advanced Analytics
Qumu Advanced Analytics provide leaders and communications staff with real-time visibility and insights into employee engagement for both live streaming video and video on demand (VOD). Advanced Analytics also help IT teams monitor and solve issues with buffering, bit rate and latency across internal networks, VPNs and external CDNs.
Automated Workflows
The Qumu platform allows users to automate processes and comply with policies by creating workflows for content approval, management and viewing rights. Automated workflows can be set for specific types of meeting recordings with disclaimers, security, time of life settings, and repurposing parameters.
Security and Access Control
Qumu's access control model can leverage most major enterprise authentication solutions, securing access to videos, channels and administrative functions. In cases where a corporate authentication service is not available, Qumu provides its own user management tools for user creation, self-registration, approvals, and group assignment.
Speech Search
Qumu Speech Search allows organizations to use their video repository for eDiscovery, internal clipping services or simply to find information quickly. Qumu Speech Search can quickly analyze thousands of hours of audio and video, index all spoken words and phrases, and return results beyond what metadata or caption-based searches can provide.
Intelligent Delivery
The Qumu platform provides a diverse, flexible and robust series of solutions for enterprise delivery of live streaming or on-demand video. At the core of Qumu’s solution is an intelligent business rules engine and CDN broker. This proprietary technology allows organizations to configure and optimize video for their specific offices, mobile users, and various endpoints. 
Qumu’s intelligent delivery supports multiple content delivery network configurations, automatically and intelligently selecting the optimal video quality for a given user, delivering video via eCDN, software CDN, and/or public CDNs. Qumu’s intelligent delivery technology can be deployed as hardware, software, or Virtual Machine. Intelligent delivery can be centrally monitored, managed, and updated. 
Extensions and Add-Ons
The Qumu platform is designed to be customizable, enhancing the customer’s enterprise communication and collaboration solution. With its service-based extensible architecture, Qumu's technology can be built upon by third-party developers. Current integrations and extensions from Qumu and its partners include Microsoft Office 365, SharePoint, Skype for Business, Yammer, IPTV, Jive, IBM Connections, Polycom, Pexip and Citrix.

Extensibility is important for meeting customers who have complex and unique digital environments and for Qumu’s network of partners. Qumu’s open, service-based architecture enables customers to more easily support native apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile platforms. The Qumu platform offers robust REST APIs for both user and administrative functions, allowing customers to develop integrations of their own on top of the Qumu platform. At the present time Qumu has available extensions and add-ons for live captioning, speech search, advanced analytics, content syndication, WebRTC and several other functions.
Marketing and Distribution
Qumu’s solutions serve a growing customer base of medium- and large-sized enterprises across a wide range of vertical and horizontal markets, with the five primary markets being 1) Banking, Finance and Insurance, 2) Manufacturing, 3) Services and Consulting, 4) Telecom and Technology, and 5) Biotech and Health Care. Qumu has historically targeted enterprises with 10,000+ employees and a history of video use for corporate communications, although its Qumu Cloud product can service organizations as small as 1,000 employees. Across all deployment types (cloud, on-premise and hybrid) and in all five markets, Qumu’s customers are among the largest Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies in the world.
Qumu serves its customer base primarily via direct sales, and to a lesser extent via channel partners, offering a variety of deployment methodologies and business models to meet customer demand including software, software on server appliances, software-enabled devices, SaaS and managed services.
Qumu has been identified as a leader by multiple industry analysts:

• | Gartner named Qumu a leader in the most recent Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Video Content Management.


• | Aragon Research named Qumu a leader in the most recent Globe Report for Enterprise Video Content Management, as well as a new contender in the most recent Globe Report for Web and Video Conferencing.


• | Frost & Sullivan named Qumu as the industry leader by honoring the company with the Competitive Strategy Innovation and Leadership Award over 20 total firms it covers in the Enterprise Video space.


• | Wainhouse Research has positioned Qumu as a leader in the Enterprise Streaming Market on multiple occasions.

As indicated by these honors, Qumu is among the leading enterprise video platform vendors in the space.
Qumu sells products and services internationally through its U.S. operation and its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan. International sales comprised approximately 33% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 27% for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. During each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had one customer that accounted for more than 10% of its revenues; no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Competition
Major competitors of Qumu include Kaltura, Brightcove, MediaPlatform, Vbrick and Panopto. Qumu competes with these other companies based primarily upon its full-stack, end-to-end solution for a complete video infrastructure that includes support for mobile devices and leverages existing IT infrastructure. Qumu occasionally encounters organizations utilizing Microsoft’s Skype and Stream technologies for video. While some view Microsoft as a competitor to Qumu, we believe that the Microsoft and Qumu technologies can be seamlessly integrated for the customer and provide the customer with greater flexibility and improved manageability than use of a Microsoft technology alone. For certain customers, Qumu also competes with the IT infrastructure and resources the customer has developed on its own to manage its video content. 
Qumu also differentiates itself from competitors through its agnostic video delivery technology, as well as its flexible deployment models—on-premise, cloud and hybrid—which Qumu customers can choose from and customize based on their own unique organizational needs for video.
Research and Development
Qumu develops its software internally and licenses or purchases software from third parties. Research and development expense was $7.0 million, $7.3 million and $8.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed 34 employees in research and development. This staff engages in research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products. In addition, Qumu partners with third parties to utilize their competencies in creating products to enhance its product offerings.

Intellectual Property
Qumu currently maintains four U.S. patents and has one non-provisional utility patent application pending in the U.S. Further, Qumu protects the proprietary nature of its software primarily through copyright and license agreements. It is Qumu's policy to protect the proprietary nature of its newly developed products whenever they are likely to become significant sources of revenue. No assurance can be given that Qumu will be able to obtain patent or other protection for its products. In addition, Qumu has registered and may in the future register trademarks and other marks used in its business.
Qumu also licenses or purchases the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate Qumu to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the revenue generated by the software using those programs. Contractual obligations with respect to such licenses will require cash payments of $200,000 in 2019.
As the number of Qumu's products increases and the functionality of those products expand, Qumu believes that it may become increasingly subject to attempts by others to duplicate its proprietary technology and to the possibility of infringement of its intellectual property. In addition, although Qumu does not believe that any of its products infringe on the rights of others, third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, Qumu's products infringe on their rights and these third parties may assert infringement claims against Qumu in the future. Qumu may litigate to enforce its intellectual property rights and to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership, scope, or validity of Qumu's proprietary rights and the rights of others. Any claim of infringement against Qumu could involve significant liabilities to third parties, could require Qumu to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent Qumu from developing, selling or using its products. 
The Company is the owner of various trademarks and trade names referenced in this Annual Report on Form 10-K including: "Qumu," "VideoNet Edge," "Pathfinder" and "How Business Does Video." Solely for convenience, the trademarks and trade names in this Report are referred to without the ® and TM symbols, but such references should not be construed as any indicator that the Company or the other respective owners will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, its or their rights thereto.
