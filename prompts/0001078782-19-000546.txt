Item 1. Business
Corporate History
 
Dakota Territory Resource Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada in 2002. The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation and has not realized any revenues from operations. The Company’s gold initiatives included:
 

The September 2012 acquisition of North Homestake Mining Company, a private Nevada corporation that owned the Blind Gold Property located in the Black Hills of South Dakota, an area known for approximately 45 million ounces of gold production since the first discovery of gold in 1876. The “Blind Gold Property” is located approximately 4 miles northwest of the historic Homestake Gold Mine. The “Blind Gold Property” is underlain by the Homestake Formation, an iron-formation that was the unique host for gold mineralization at the Homestake Mine. The founders of North Homestake have 44-years of combined experience at the Homestake Mine, directly related to gold mining and exploration. 
 

The December 2012 acquisition of three groups of unpatented lode mining claims from Black Hills Gold Exploration LLC. Comprised of fifty-seven unpatented lode mining claims, the property acquisition covers approximately 853 acres in total. Twenty-three of the claims acquired are situated to the west, south and southeast of the Company's Blind Gold Property, with the balance of the claims establishing the Homestake Paleoplacer and City Creek Properties. All three properties are brownfields exploration targets based the previous work performed by Homestake Mining Company. With the addition of the new property in 2012, Dakota Territory increased the size of its land package in the Black Hills by approximately 50% to nearly 2,466 acres in total. 
 

The February 2014 acquisition of surface and mineral title to the 26.16 acres of the Squaw and Rubber Neck Lodes that comprise Mineral Survey 1706 in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Located immediately to the north and adjoining the Company’s Paleoplacer Property, Mineral Survey 1706 was explored by Homestake Mining Company in the late 1980’s. 
 

The March 2014 acquisition of approximately 565.24 mineral acres in the Northern Black Hills of South Dakota. The acquisition increased our mineral interests in the Homestake District by nearly 23%, to over 3,057 acres. As part of the property acquisition, we purchased an additional 64.39 mineral acres located immediately southwest and contiguous to our Paleoplacer Property, including mineral title to the historic Gustin, Minerva and Deadbroke Gold Mines. The three mines were the last of a string of nine mines that produced ore from the fossil gold placer originating from the Homestake Lode. The March 2014 acquisition consolidated and extended our Paleoplacer Property position to a distance extending approximately 3,100 feet along the trend of the channel. 
 

The April 2017 acquisition of a combination of surface and mineral title to 284 acres in the Homestake District of the Northern Black Hills of South Dakota. The acquisition included 61 acres located immediately south and contiguous with our City Creek Property; 82 acres located approximately one half mile south of our Blind Gold Property at the western fringe of the historic Maitland Gold Mine; and 141 acres located immediately north and contiguous to our Homestake Paleoplacer Property, which extended approximately 2,600 feet of the channel trend to our property position. 
 

The November 2018 acquisition of 42 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 718 acres located immediately to the north and adjacent to the Company’s City Creek Property. The acquisition was based on our inversion modeling of magnetic and gravity geophysical survey data. Through this staking, the City Creek project area was expanded from approximately 449 acres to 1,167 acres and the Company’s overall land holdings in the Homestake District were increased from 3,341 acres to approximately 4,059 acres in total. 
 
U.S. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any defined resources will ever be converted into SEC Guide 7 compliant reserves.
 
Competitors
 
The mining industry is highly competitive. We will be competing with numerous companies, substantially all with greater financial resources available to them. We therefore will be at a significant disadvantage in the course of acquiring mining properties and obtaining materials, supplies, labor, and equipment. Additionally, we are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of exploration and mineral property development. A large number of established and well-financed companies are active in the mining industry and will have an advantage over us if they are competing for the same properties. Nearly all such entities have greater financial resources and managerial capabilities than ourselves and, consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible mining properties and procuring the same.

Government Approvals
 
The exploration, drilling and mining industries operate in a legal environment that requires permits to conduct virtually all operations. Thus permits are required by local, state and federal government agencies. Local authorities, usually counties, also have control over mining activity. The various permits address such issues as prospecting, development, production, labor standards, taxes, occupational health and safety, toxic substances, air quality, water use, water discharge, water quality, noise, dust, wildlife impacts, as well as other environmental and socioeconomic issues.
 
Prior to receiving the necessary permits to explore or mine, the operator must comply with all regulatory requirements imposed by all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project area. Very often, in order to obtain the requisite permits, the operator must have its land reclamation, restoration or replacement plans pre-approved. Specifically, the operator must present its plan as to how it intends to restore or replace the affected area. Often all or any of these requirements can cause delays or involve costly studies or alterations of the proposed activity or time frame of operations, in order to mitigate impacts. All of these factors make it more difficult and costly to operate and have a negative and sometimes fatal impact on the viability of the exploration or mining operation. Finally, it is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our business, causing those activities to be economically re-evaluated at that time.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Government and Environmental Regulations
 
Mineral exploration, including mining operations are subject to governmental regulation. Our operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation such as restrictions on production, price controls, tax increases, expropriation of property, environmental and pollution controls or changes in conditions under which minerals may be marketed. An excess supply of certain minerals may exist from time to time due to lack of markets, restrictions on exports, and numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include market fluctuations and government regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, allowable production and importing and exporting minerals. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately determined, and we are not aware of any probable government regulations that would impact the Company. This section is intended as a brief overview of the laws and regulations described herein and is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject matter.
Overview. Like all other mining companies doing business in the United States, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations designed to protect the quality of the air and water, and threatened or endangered species, in the vicinity of its operations. These include “permitting” or pre-operating approval requirements designed to ensure the environmental integrity of a proposed mining facility, operating requirements designed to mitigate the effects of discharges into the environment during exploration, mining operations, and reclamation or post-operation requirements designed to remediate the lands affected by a mining facility once commercial mining operations have ceased.
 
Federal legislation in the United States and implementing regulations adopted and administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies—in particular, legislation such as the federal Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Forest Management Act, the Wilderness Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act—have a direct bearing on domestic mining operations. These federal initiatives are often administered and enforced through state agencies operating under parallel state statutes and regulations.
 
The Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act is the principal federal environmental protection law regulating mining operations in the United States as it pertains to water quality.
 
At the state level, water quality is regulated by the Environment Department, Water and Waste Management Division under the Water Quality Act (state). If our exploration or any future development activities might affect a ground water aquifer, it will have to apply for a Ground Water Discharge Permit from the Ground Water Quality Bureau in compliance with the Groundwater Regulations. If exploration affects surface water, then compliance with the Surface Water Regulations is required.
The Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act establishes ambient air quality standards, limits the discharges of new sources and hazardous air pollutants and establishes a federal air quality permitting program for such discharges. Hazardous materials are defined in the federal Clean Air Act and enabling regulations adopted under the federal Clean Air Act to include various metals. The federal Clean Air Act also imposes limitations on the level of particulate matter generated from mining operations.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires all governmental agencies to consider the impact on the human environment of major federal actions as therein defined.

Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA requires federal agencies to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat. In order to facilitate the conservation of imperiled species, the ESA establishes an interagency consultation process. When a federal agency proposes an action that “may affect” a listed species, it must consult with the USFWS and must prepare a “biological assessment” of the effects of a major construction activity if the USFWS advises that a threatened species may be present in the area of the activity.
National Forest Management Act. The National Forest Management Act, as implemented through title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, provides a planning framework for lands and resource management of the National Forests. The planning framework seeks to manage the National Forest System resources in a combination that best serves the public interest without impairment of the productivity of the land, consistent with the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960.
Wilderness Act. The Wilderness Act of 1964 created a National Wilderness Preservation System composed of federally owned areas designated by Congress as “wilderness areas” to be preserved for future use and enjoyment.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA imposes clean-up and reclamation responsibilities with respect to discharges into the environment, and establishes significant criminal and civil penalties against those persons who are primarily responsible for such discharges.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RCRA was designed and implemented to regulate the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. It restricts solid waste disposal practices and the management, reuse or recovery of solid wastes and imposes substantial additional requirements on the subcategory of solid wastes that are determined to be hazardous. Like the Clean Water Act, RCRA provides for citizens’ suits to enforce the provisions of the law.
National Historic Preservation Act. The National Historic Preservation Act was designed and implemented to protect historic and cultural properties. Compliance with the Act is necessary where federal properties or federal actions are undertaken, such as mineral exploration on federal land, which may impact historic or traditional cultural properties, including native or Indian cultural sites.
 
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we incurred minimal costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations in relation to our operating activities. Costs in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 will increase due to our anticipated drilling activities at our Homestake Paleoplacer Property.
 
Employees
 
We have no employees. Our management, all of whom are consultants, conducts our operations. We do not expect any material changes in the number of employees over the next twelve-month period. Given the early stage of our exploration properties, we intend to continue to outsource our professional and personnel requirements by retaining consultants on an as needed basis. However, if we are successful in our initial and any subsequent drilling programs, we may retain employees.
