Overview
 
Pineapple, Inc. (f/k/a Pineapple Express‪, Inc). (“Pineapple”, the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a pioneer in the cannabis industry. As a result of a share exchange agreement entered into in March 2019, as subsequently amended, and a debt forgiveness agreement in January 2020, the Company has a 45.17% equity stake, as discussed below, in Pineapple Ventures, Inc. (“PVI”). PVI invests in established cannabis businesses, funds cannabis start-up businesses, and may establish cannabis storefronts.

In November 2021, PVI acquired 100% of PNPL Holdings Inc., a newly created holding company because the City of Los Angeles passed a provision stating that management companies cannot hold direct equity in the operations PVI manage. As such, PNPL Holdings, Inc. was set up for PVI’s equity in Hollywood and Vine, CA, West LA, CA, South Los Angeles, CA, Eagle Rock, CA and San Pedro, CA dispensaries. CGI and UHC remain unaffected since these dispensaries are not in the City of Los Angeles.
 
PVI’s cannabis delivery service has already commenced operations and was launched out of Los Angeles, CA in January 2019. As a result of its equity stake in PVI, the Company will receive 45.17% of all net income/ loss generated by PVI from these business ventures. The owned and managed cannabis licenses and real property rental and sublease assets along with the Company’s brand recognition and intellectual property are prepared to penetrate the cannabis market from ‘seed to sale’ for cultivation, manufacturing, distribution, retail storefront, and delivery in the State of California.

Through PVI’s Pineapple Wellness brand (established on January 11, 2019), the Company aims to be a trusted source for hemp-derived CBD products which are being sold to customers nationwide. Operating by the principals of “Know What You Consume,” and its mission of transparency, the Company aims to ensure conscious and ethical business while delivering the best hemp CBD products the alternative health industry has to offer. The Company’s Hemp CBD products are organically grown, non-GMO, do not contain heavy metals or toxins, and contain no heavy solvents. From plant to bottle, the Company offers lab-tested, quality CBD products that are natural and potent. Thus, it is anticipated that the Company shall benefit and capitalize on decriminalized hemp derived products, licensed and decriminalized cannabis derived products, as well as cannabis property rental subleases for a profit without being directly being involved with sales, production, or distribution of cannabis.
 
ln addition to having stakes in the foregoing business ventures, the Company was also assigned a patent for the proprietary Top Shelf Safe Display System (“SDS”) for use in permitted cannabis dispensaries and delivery vehicles across the United States and internationally (where permitted by law), on July 20, 2016, by Sky Island, Inc. (the “SDS Patent”) via a Patent Assignment Agreement (the “Patent Assignment Agreement”). The SDS Patent was originally applied for and filed on August 11, 2015, by Sky Island, Inc. and received its notice of allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office on March 22, 2017. It is anticipated that the Top-Shelf SDS product shall retail for $30,000 per unit. Pineapple intends to sell the Top-Shelf SDS units to PVI for use in retail storefronts and delivery vehicles as well as to sell the Top Shelf SDS technology to other cannabis retail companies. The Company anticipates beginning sales of the Top Shelf SDS system in the third quarter of 2022.
 
Additionally in 2019, PVI took preliminary business steps towards a project with Nordhoff Leases, Inc. (“Nordhoff”), a related party, in which Nordhoff subleased 38,875 square feet in a building to three 15% owned entities by PVI (the “PVI Entities”); however, the contemplated project never matriculated. As part of these preliminary business steps, an affiliated entity of PVI, Neu-Ventures, Inc., paid Nordhoff’s $50,000 per month rent expense and PVI’s founders invested over $300,000 in leasehold improvements for Nordhoff’s rental property.
 
In June of 2020, Nordhoff’s $50,000 rent payments per month were increased to $87,000 per month. During the same month, the PVI entities sold their respective cannabis licenses for aggregate proceeds of $2.87 million, of which approximately $431,000 was assigned and recognized by PVI. PVI assigned its PVI Entities’ subleases with Nordhoff to the buyer as part of the sale.
 
Company Background
 
Pineapple shares of common stock are still quoted on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol “PNPL”. As of the date of this Annual Report, OTC Markets has designated the Company’s trading symbol as “Caveat Emptor” by placing a skull and crossbones icon next to the symbol. This designation occurred when the Company was issued an Order of Suspension of Trading from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 28th, 2016, because of “recent, unusual and unexplained market activity in the Company’s stock that raises concerns about the adequacy of publicly-available information regarding the Company”. The Company was released from suspension two weeks later. The Company was not charged with any wrong-doing and believes the unusual spike in stock activity was related to an enormous amount of press received by the Company because a famous cultural icon invested in the Company stock. The Company was not fully reporting with the SEC yet when this occurred. The Company intends on becoming fully reporting with the SEC. The Company then intends to have a market maker quote its shares of common stock on the OTCQB or another over-the-counter trading platform, thereby moving from the current OTC Grey platform.
 
The Company regained current status with its filing obligations in the fourth quarter of 2021, and a licensed broker filed a Form 15c2-11 application in order to remove the caveat emptor symbol and resume quotations on the OTC marketplace.
 
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 3, 1983, as “Global Resources, Ltd”. On April 12, 1999, the Company changed its name from “Global Resources, Ltd.” to “Helixsphere Technologies, Inc.” and on October 02, 2013, to “New China Global Inc.” On October 30, 2013, the Company filed Articles of Continuance with the Secretary of State in the State of Wyoming pursuant to which the Company re-domiciled from the State of Nevada to the State of Wyoming. On July 15, 2014, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from “New China Global Inc.” to “Globestar Industries”.

On August 24, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement) with Better Business Consultants, Inc. (“BBC”), a corporation incorporated under the laws of California on January 29, 2015, and Shane Oei, a majority shareholder of the Company at the time. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, BBC shareholders exchanged all of the issued and outstanding capital of BBC for an aggregate of 50,000,000 newly and duly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Company. Upon closing, BBC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In addition, Mr. Oei and Gary Stockport, another former shareholder of the Company at the time, cancelled 100,000,000 and 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, respectively, in connection with the Agreement. As the owners and management of BBC obtained voting and operating control of the Company after the share exchange and Globestar Industries was non-operating, the transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization of BBC, accompanied by the exchange of previously issued common stock for outstanding common stock of Globestar Industries, which was recorded at a nominal value. One of the owners, Jaime Ortega, also entered into a Lockup Agreement under which he could not sell his ownership in the Company through September 1, 2017.
 
On September 3, 2015, the Company changed its name from “Globestar Industries” to “Pineapple Express, Inc.” The Company’s name has no relation to the 2008 motion picture produced by Columbia Pictures.
 
In September 2015, the Company had entered into agreements to issue 500,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to Sky Island, Inc. in exchange for a patent and 100,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to Christopher Plummer as compensation for taking on the role of Chief Operating Officer. However, both of these issuances were rescinded effective December 31, 2015.
 
On February 12, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement of Merger to acquire all of the assets and assume several liabilities of THC Industries, Inc., a California corporation (“THC Parent”), through a two-step merger (the “THC Merger”) by and among the Company, THC Parent, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary THC Industries, LLC, a California limited liability company (“THC”), and the Company’s former wholly owned subsidiary THCMergerCo., Inc., a California corporation. In June 2016, the Company began to anticipate significant difficulties in monetizing the value of the acquired intangible assets and recorded an impairment of those assets.
 
On August 5, 2016, the Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement with THC Industries, Inc. because of late payments. This sparked a temporary foreclosure of assets. On March 23rd, 2017, The Company entered into a Standstill and Waiver Agreement with THC Industries, Inc. because of additional late payments. On June 22, 2017, the Company successfully completed the conditions of the Standstill and Waiver Agreement signed between the parties on March 27, 2017. The Company made its payments and completed its conditions in full for the Forbearance Agreement. The Company gained back control of the assets relative to the purchase transaction.
 
On March 14, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement to sell BBC and its three wholly owned subsidiaries, Pineapple Express One LLC, a California limited liability company, Pineapple Express Two LLC, a California limited liability company, and Pineapple Property Investments, LLC, a Washington limited liability company, to a related party, Jaime Ortega. The sale of BBC and its subsidiaries to Mr. Ortega was in exchange for Mr. Ortega forgiving a debt of $10,000 owed to Sky Island, Inc, a wholly owned entity by Mr. Ortega, and in order for Mr. Ortega to fund and prosecute litigation claims (as discussed below) and settle debts for the subsidiaries resulting from unconsummated parcel purchases which the Company believes were purposely circumvented by third parties involved in those transactions. The terms of the Share Purchase Agreement are discussed in greater detail in the “legal proceedings” section of this Annual Report. On January 27, 2018, the Company completed the sale of BBC, Pineapple Express One LLC, Pineapple Express Two LLC and Pineapple Property Investments, LLC to Mr. Ortega.
 
With respect to such litigation claims related to BBC, on April 7, 2017, Orr Builders, Prest-Vuksic Architects, Inc. and MSA Consulting, Inc. filed a claim against the Company, including subsidiaries Pineapple Express One LLC, Better Business Consultants Inc., Clonenetics Laboratories Cooperative, Inc.; United Pentecostal Church; and Healing Nature, LLC; within the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Riverside, Case No. PSC 1700746 (hereinafter referred to as the “Lead Case”), and a related and consolidated Case No. PSC1702268 (in which the Company was not a named defendant), alleging, among other things: (i) breaches of contracts related to the building of a warehouse in Desert Hot Springs, CA in the amount of $1,250,000, (ii) foreclosure of mechanics’ lien, (iii) negligent misrepresentation, and (iii) unjust enrichment (against United Pentecostal Church only). In 2019, the land (which was leased by the Company and sold to a third party) and warehouse (which was being built for the Company, yet completed by the third party) at 65241 San Jacinto Lane in Desert Hot Springs, CA, were ordered sold by way of judgment and the plaintiffs were entitled to recovery.

On March 16, 2017, the Company formed Pineapple Express Consulting, Inc. (“PEC”) as a wholly owned subsidiary. On August 3, 2017, a letter of intent (“LOI”) was entered into between PEC and Sky Island, Inc., whereby all the assets of Pineapple Park, LLC, a California limited liability company controlled by Sky Island, Inc. holding lease deposits, were to be transferred through a related party transfer to PEC in exchange for $100,000. On December 31, 2018, Pineapple Park, LLC pulled out of this project and signed a mutual release agreement for all lessees and Pineapple Park, LLC to terminate each party’s obligations and responsibilities under the Leases and the Parties’ relationship. The Company had planned on using revenue from operations, including license proceeds from contracts already signed with licensees as well as rental payments due from tenants. The Company was also in the process of developing a “franchise style” model whereas it would license its trademark, brand name, and retail design concept in exchange for a 5% perpetuity royalty. These revenue streams were to provide the Company with long-term and short-term growth. However, after the investment in PVI, the Company will now be receiving revenues from its 45.17% ownership.
 
On March 19, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “PVI Agreement”) with PVI and the stockholders of PVI (the “PVI Stockholders”). Upon execution of the PVI Agreement (the “Closing”), the Company acquired 20,000 shares of PVI’s outstanding capital stock (“PVI Shares”), equaling 20% of the outstanding shares of PVI. In consideration for the PVI Shares, the Company agreed to issue 1,000,000 shares of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.0000001 par value per share (“Series A Convertible Preferred Stock”), to the PVI Stockholders. Pursuant to the terms of the PVI Agreement and Amendment No. 1 dated June 26, 2019, upon the six-month anniversary of the PVI Agreement (the “Second Closing”), and subject to the conditions to closing set forth in the PVI Agreement, the Company was to acquire an additional 30,000 PVI Shares, equaling 30% of the outstanding shares of PVI, for a total of 50% of the outstanding shares of PVI, in consideration for an additional 1,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to be issued to the PVI Stockholders at the time of the Second Closing. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may, from time to time, be converted by the holder into shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.0000001 (the “Common Stock”) in an amount equal to ten (10) shares of Common Stock for each one (1) share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. On July 5, 2019, the Company, PVI and the PVI Stockholders, and their respective boards of directors waived the remaining conditions to closing as set forth in the PVI Agreement and ratified and approved the Second Closing. As a result of the PVI investment, the Company now has a portfolio asset (PVI) with which it has entered the cannabis cultivation, production, and distribution sector throughout California. The PVI Stockholders elected to immediately convert their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of common stock.
 
On January 17, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Jaime Ortega whereby in exchange for Mr. Ortega cancelling $1,062,000 of existing loans extended to the Company by Jaime Ortega, Neu-Ventures, Inc., and Sky Island, Inc., the Company sold to Mr. Ortega 10,000 shares of capital stock of Pineapple Ventures, Inc. (“PVI”). Subsequently, on February 11, 2021, the parties entered into amended agreement pursuant to which the original number of shares sold to Mr. Ortega were reduced from 10,000 shares of capital stock of PVI to 4,827 shares of capital stock of PVI. Accordingly, the Company currently owns 45,173 shares of capital stock of PVI. This amendment was entered into to properly reflect the value of the Company’s stock at the time of the initial agreement.
 
Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”), dated as of April 6, 2020, by and between, Pineapple Express, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“Pineapple Express”), and Pineapple, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Pineapple”) and wholly owned subsidiary of Pineapple Express, effective as of April 15, 2020 (the “Effective Date”), Pineapple Express merged with and into Pineapple, with Pineapple being the surviving entity (the “Reincorporation Merger”). The Reincorporation Merger was consummated to complete Pineapple Express’ reincorporation from the State of Wyoming to the State of Nevada. The Merger Agreement, the Reincorporation Merger, the Name Change (as defined below) and the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Pineapple were duly approved by the written consent of shareholders of Pineapple Express owning at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Pineapple Express’ common stock, par value $0.0000001 per share (the “PE Common Stock”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company’s corporate name changed from “Pineapple Express, Inc.” to “Pineapple, Inc.”
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States. As a result, significant volatility has occurred in both the United States and international markets. While the disruption is currently expected to be temporary, there is uncertainty around the duration. To date, the Company has experienced declining revenues, difficulty meeting debt covenants, maintaining consistent service quality with reduced revenue, and a loss of access to customers. Management expects this matter to continue to impact our business, results of operations, and financial position, but the ultimate financial impact of the pandemic on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial position, liquidity or capital resources cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

In October 2020, PNPXPRESS, Inc. (an entity managed by PVI) secured three cannabis licenses, including consumer delivery and statewide distribution, from the City of Los Angeles Department of Cannabis Regulation (“LADCR”) for a retail storefront location at the intersection of Hollywood & Vine (1704 N. Vine Street). The lease was signed in October 2020. This 3,460 square foot dispensary will be called Pineapple Express and is scheduled to open by February of 2022, pending inspections from the LADCR. PVI has initially received 30% equity and has received a management fee of 10% of sales of this entity. On October 29, 2021, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with an unrelated investor for the sale of 20% equity of PNPXPRESS, Inc. for a total consideration of $1,500,000. As of December 31, 2021, the Company will receive 10% of equity and will receive a management fee of 10% of sales of this entity.
 
On August 7, 2021, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “CGI Agreement”) with Capital Growth Investments, Inc., a California corporation (“CGI”) and PVI, the Company’s equity-method investee. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company can acquire up to 50,000 shares of CGI (the “Shares”), which comprise 50% of its issued and outstanding capital stock, from PVI for an aggregate purchase price of $1,000,000. As of December 31, 2021, $100,000 was paid by the Company, which was recorded and presented in Deposit – Stock purchase agreement related party in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021. No shares of CGI will be issued until the full purchase price is paid.
 
Within 60 days of execution of the Agreement, the remaining balance of $900,000 was to be paid in exchange for the full 50% of the Shares of the Company. Contemporaneously with the execution of the CGI Agreement, the parties entered into a Shareholder Agreement with CGI (the “Shareholder Agreement”). Pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement, the Company was granted certain anti-dilution rights, as well certain monthly distributions of net cash from the operations of CGI, along with other voting and indemnification rights. Pursuant to an Amendment to Stock Purchase Agreement, dated November 26, 2021, the Company, CGI and PVI have acknowledged that the Purchase Price, which shall be paid by Buyer in installments of $100,000 as a refundable deposit, has been received. The remaining balance of $900,000 was to be paid in exchange for the entirety of the Shares on or before March 31, 2022. Should the Buyer be unable to fund the balance of $900,000 by March 31, 2022, the transaction shall be cancelled and the refundable deposit of $100,000 shall be returned to the Company. In March of 2022, the parties mutually agreed to extend the closing date to June 30, 2022 (see note 14).
 
Regulatory Overview
 
As of the date of this filing, 37 states and four (4) territories allow for the medical use of cannabis products, while 17 of those states, the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam have also legalized the adult-use of cannabis. Although legalized in some states, cannabis is a “Schedule 1” drug under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”) and is illegal under federal law.
 
On August 29, 2013, the Department of Justice set out its prosecutorial priorities in light of various states legalizing cannabis for medicinal and/or recreational use. The “Cole Memorandum” provided that when states have implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to threaten the federal priorities. Indeed, a robust system may affirmatively address those priorities by, for example, implementing effective measures to prevent diversion of cannabis outside of the regulated system and to other states, prohibiting access to cannabis by minors, and replacing an illicit cannabis trade that funds criminal enterprises with a tightly regulated market in which revenues are tracked and accounted for. In those circumstances, consistent with the traditional allocation of federal-state efforts in this area, the Cole Memorandum provided that enforcement of state law by state and local law enforcement and regulatory bodies should remain the primary means of addressing cannabis-related activity. If state enforcement efforts are not sufficiently robust to protect against the harms set forth above, the federal government may seek to challenge the regulatory structure itself in addition to continuing to bring individual enforcement actions, including criminal prosecutions, focused on those harms.
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum for all United States Attorneys concerning cannabis enforcement under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Mr. Sessions rescinded all previous prosecutorial guidance issued by the Department of Justice regarding cannabis, including the August 29, 2013 “Cole Memorandum”.

-


In rescinding the Cole Memorandum, Mr. Sessions stated that U.S. Attorneys must decide whether or not to pursue prosecution of cannabis activity based upon factors including: the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. Mr. Sessions reiterated that the cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana continues to be a crime under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.
 
On March 23, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law a $1.3 trillion-dollar spending bill that included an amendment known as “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer,” which prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to prevent certain states “from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis.”
 
On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the “Farm Bill”. Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, was classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, and so illegal under the federal CSA.
 
With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is now broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.
 
Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive “high” associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis—or marijuana—under the CSA and would not be legally protected under this new legislation and would be treated as an illegal Schedule 1 drug.
 
Additionally, there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the “USDA”). A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states had in other policy areas, such as health insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under the Occupational Health and Safety Act—both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems.
 
The Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses.
 
One of the goals of the previous 2014 Farm Bill was to generate and protect research into hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill continues this effort. Section 7605 re-extends the protections for hemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further, section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under the Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it, but also recognizes that there is a still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives.
 
On January 21, 2021, Joseph R. Biden, Jr. was sworn in as President of the United States. President Biden’s Attorney General, Merrick Garland, was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2021. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), under President Biden and Attorney General Garland, will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. During his Senate confirmation, Merrick Garland told Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), “It does not seem to me useful the use of limited resources that we have to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.” Such statements are not official declarations or policies of the DOJ and are not binding on the DOJ, any United States Attorney, or the United States federal courts. Substantial uncertainty regarding United States federal enforcement remains. To date, there have been no new federal cannabis memorandums issued by the Biden Administration or any published change in federal enforcement policy.

Business Overview
 
Through our operating subsidiaries and equity-method investment, we provide capital to our canna-business clientele and provide consulting services and technology to develop, enhance, and expand existing and newly formed canna-businesses.
 
We also intend to create a nationally branded and vertically integrated chain of cannabis retail stores under the “Pineapple Express” brand, which will be supported by Company-owned cultivation and processing facilities and will feature products from anticipated Company-owned manufacturers. The Company currently owns and manages city and state licensed cannabis production, manufacturing, commercial distribution, retail dispensary and distribution and home delivery dispensaries.
 
Companies in the cannabis industry face unique challenges and risks. To mitigate these risks, we operate both as an operating business and as a business that invests in other entities. It is our intention that this strategy will enable us to quickly develop recurring and easily replicable revenue sources, and avoid large upfront investments in infrastructure, escalating payroll costs associated with expansion, and the years of initial losses often typical of start-up companies. We believe that our competitive advantages include our business model, our exclusive proprietary technology, our employees’ and consultants’ extensive experience, and our key industry contacts in an industry that is both new and foreign to most. It is our expectation that these factors will set us apart from most of our competitors.
 
We believe that due to the highly fragmented nature of the existing cannabis industry, a vertically integrated supply chain will provide a sustainable competitive advantage over competitors, allow faster growth, foster more consistent product offerings, and make Pineapple’s PVI portfolio asset more attractive for prospective licensees and customers. PVI’s revenues and profitability may be adversely affected by economic conditions and changes in the market for medical and recreational marijuana. PVI’s business is also subject to general economic risks that could adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition (see Risk Factors). We discuss each facet of our strategy and different line of business below.
 
Retail Opportunities
 
As of the date of filing of this Annual Report, management has identified the following nationally recognized retail cannabis chains: Cresco Labs, Curealeaf Holdings, Inc., Green Thumb Industries, Inc., Truelieve Cannabis Corp, Acreage Holdings, Inc., Medmen, iAnthus, and Harvest Health and Recreation.
 
We expect that the nationally recognized chains that will be successful will either find long-term success in the retail environment, or will discover a financially attractive exit when, as management anticipates, the acquisition and consolidation phase in the industry begins. However, we believe that phase is some time away and will be dependent, at least in part, upon changes to existing federal laws and classifications. We believe that this creates an exceptionally unique opportunity for experienced and focused management teams to develop a national presence. Of particular importance and a distinct barrier to entry for the average entrepreneur is the importance of personal networks, expertise, and processes necessary to carry out project goals in this industry. PVI management’s extensive experience and relationships set the Company apart from most of its competitors.
 
Due to a lack of established major national chains, PVI faces competition primarily from local or regional companies. It is our belief that a variety of federally enforced rules and regulations make participation by existing national healthcare chains unlikely in the near term.
 
Developing retail facilities from the ‘ground-up’ is a challenge in the cannabis industry. For example, stores must be licensed, which generally involves a costly, complex, and time-consuming process. Several jurisdictions have imposed strict limits on the number of licenses that may be issued. The present nature of cannabis in the national legislative realm has resulted in very strict zoning requirements for these types of businesses. These licensing hurdles translate into slow organic growth.
 
The PVI model involves PVI (a) funding established businesses in need of capital to expand where it may enjoy an eventual control option on the business (e.g. capital is invested in the business keeping the current owner focused on growth); (b) funding teams of industry professionals that are in the process of developing a new operation and are in need of guidance and capital; and to a more limited degree, (c) establishing Company owned stores from the “ground-up.” PVI believes there are many obstacles in creating a robust and profitable national chain and at present direct store development will not be the most efficient path to success in the current cannabis environment. PVI believes approaching growth in this manner will allow it to quickly generate revenue and reach sustainable profitability. PVI is looking to pursue additional transactions with retail and cultivation facilities, manufacturers, and distributors. Please see the Initial Strategy Execution Section below for additional information.
 
Obstacles and the Pineapple Solution
 
One obstacle to a national retail chain is producing and transporting the product. Due to existing federal laws, marijuana-based products cannot be transported across state lines. While cannabis remains illegal at the federal level, the federal government has by written policy set forth a safe harbor framework to allow the states limited independence to experiment with cannabis legalization in various forms. States have been careful to craft their local regulations to not run afoul of interstate transportation restrictions. State regulations generally require that cannabis must be grown locally (some states require retailers to grow their own product,) and that cannabis-related products, including marijuana-infused edibles, oils, lotions, or salves, cannot be transported across state lines. For larger manufacturers, state regulations generally require establishing local manufacturing in each state; this translates to securing a local state-issued license, a challenging task in jurisdictions with limited licenses. The alternative approaches to establishing national retail chains are either through contract manufacturing or licensing. These approaches create challenges with product consistency and the complications for the manufacturer of managing so many relationships and monitoring quality. PVI has found an opportunity in the obstacle.

Cannabis Production and Delivery Service
 
PVI is developing its cannabis and hemp and CBD-product cultivation, production and distribution businesses in various cities throughout the state of California. PVI’s business model is to provide for a vertical solution to its cannabis cultivation, production, and distribution services throughout the state of California.
 
In March 2019, PVI launched PineappleWellness.com, a website owned by PVI, to sale and distribute hemp and CBD-based products. In April 2019, PVI re-launched PineappleExpress.com, with a focus on its cannabis sales and delivery service.
 
PVI, through its affiliates, obtained several permits from the Department of Public Health in the State of California to permit the temporary production of medical cannabis and adult cannabis products, from the California Department of Food and Agriculture for the temporary cultivation of cannabis, and from the California Bureau of Cannabis Control to permit temporary cannabis distribution. PVI, through its affiliates, obtained cannabis-production, distribution, and delivery permits from local city authorities, including in the cities of Chatsworth, Palm Springs, and Maywood (Los Angeles County).
 
In March 2019, PVI entered into a Management Services Agreement with Universal Herbal Center, Inc. (“UHC”), located in Maywood, California, to serve as the Company’s primary cannabis retail delivery center for sourcing its cannabis products to local suppliers. As of the date of this Annual Report, UHC is currently delivering cannabis products to customers in Southern California.
 
In March 2019, PVI also entered into a second Management Services Agreement with Capital Growth Investments, Inc. (“CGI”), a retail dispensary and delivery hub intended to service the Palm Springs and Riverside County areas. PVI has obtained the relevant retail delivery and cultivation licenses for the CGI facility. It is anticipated that CGI will contain both delivery and a retail dispensary. This location is currently being built.
 
In October 2021, PVI entered into a Management Services Agreement with Enchanted Lands LLC located in Los Angeles, California.
 
The Company took preliminary business steps towards a project with Nordhoff Leases, Inc. and its proposed sub-lease companies, though the contemplated project never matriculated. As part of these preliminary business steps, rent payment paid by PVI for Nordhoff Leases, Inc., at a rate of $50,000 per month were made and PVI founders invested over $300,000 in leasehold improvements. In June 2020, the $50,000 rent payments per months were increased to $87,000 per month. During the same month, PVI then sold the licenses associated with these entities for $2.87 million to support its operation (15% was owned by PVI) and assigned the lease as part of the sale. PVI received 15% of the proceeds.
 
PVI through its affiliate UHC maintains a fleet of 15 delivery vehicles at the Los Angeles, CA location to service its retail delivery needs. The vehicles are outfitted with GPS, security cameras, temperature-controlled safes, cash drawers, and panic buttons.
 
Consulting Services
 
The Pineapple management team understands the consulting, licensing, development, and compliance areas of the cannabis business and has hands-on operational experience in dispensary management from previous employment in the cannabis industry. Currently, the Company is not pursuing any consulting revenue. The Company anticipates selling the Top Shelf Safe Display System in the third fiscal quarter of 2022. The Company is planning to sell the system to PVI and other cannabis dispensary companies at $30,000 per unit. Furthermore, the Company will receive revenues from its 45.17% ownership in PVI. These revenue streams will provide the Company with long- and short-term growth capital.

Marketing, Licensing & Promotion
 
The Company’s portfolio asset, PVI strives to establish brand objectives, identify promotional strategies, and execute publicity and marketing plans to ensure its place in the cultural conversation. The goal is to connect with consumers on a local and national level through advertising, marketing, and strategic alliances, in order to create brand awareness for the Pineapple and THC brands. Publicity and marketing initiatives include specific strategies for radio, billboards, print media (magazines and newspapers), social media, exhibitions at industry trade shows, and local grassroots marketing efforts.
 
We have developed a pipeline of opportunities and have executed definitive agreements for the following transactions:
 
On February 12, 2016, the Company acquired the business and assets of THC Parent, the web domain www.thc.com, and the trademark THC®. THC Parent was an operating business since its incorporation in California in 1996, making it one of the first internet-based cannabis related businesses in the nation. The acquisition includes the THC.com URL address, the THC branded clothing line, use of a clothing distribution facility, and the rights to sell clothing, namely T-shirts, hats, beanies, pants, shorts, baseball jerseys, jackets, sweatshirts, polo shirts, and sweatpants displaying the THC trademarked name and logo.
 
In connection with the THC Merger, Ramsey Salem, the former Chief Executive Officer of THC Parent, joined the Company as Chief Executive Officer of THC in February 2016 and agreed to serve in this position for a period of five years. The Company acquired the THC business for consideration consisting of (i) a cash payment in the amount of $400,000, (ii) 2,275,133 shares of Common Stock and (iii) a $600,000 note secured by all of the purchased intellectual property that is payable in two equal installments on the 60 day and 90-day anniversaries of closing. The Company has since made these payments and has subsequently paid all amounts due under the purchase agreement on June 22, 2017. The THC Parent shareholders had the option to require the Company to purchase from them up to 1,478,836 shares at a price of $0.68 per share from February 12, 2018, through August 12, 2018; provided, however, that they may only exercise this option if, for a 90-day period, the Company’s stock price is both less than $0.88 and the average daily trading volume is below 50,000. They did attempt to exercise this option, and the matter was subsequently resolved. The Company reported such settlement amount in accounts payable as of December 31, 2020. THC Parent Shareholders agreed to cancel an aggregate of 1,829,631 shares of the Company’s common stock, retaining 400,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Based on the settlement agreement, the Company derecognized the $1,000,000 put option exercise amount along with the $1,000,000 stock subscription receivable as of December 31, 2020.
 
In July 2016, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with The Sharpe Company (“Sharpe”) to develop brand strategy, positioning, and lifestyle merchandise for the THC brand. In partnership with Sharpe, the Company has updated THC’s catalog of products and added new products. This agreement is no longer in existence and the THC.com website and trademark are being utilized by PVI per the Share Exchange Agreement. The Company currently owes The Sharpe Company $18,692.
 
In May 2017, the Company entered into a transaction whereas it licensed the THC.com website to The Hit Channel, Inc., which has agreed to develop the website and pay an initial licensing fee of $150,000 and enter into a revenue sharing arrangement thereafter, subject to an annual minimum amount guaranteed for the life of the contract. The THC.com website re-launched in the first quarter of 2018. This relationship is no longer in existence per a February 4, 2020, Purchase and Settlement Agreement where the Company paid The Hit Channel $40,000 and 555,275 shares of the Company stock for control for a return of control of the THC.com website, which was returned to Pineapple.
 
In May 2017, the Company licensed its THC trademark to Putnam Accessory Group, Inc. (“PAG”), a leading accessory design, product development, production and logistics company for private label and branded fashion. PAG specialize in young men’s, women’s and junior’s headwear, cold weather beanies, scarves, gloves, an array of both fashion and technical bags as well as small accessory items. Established in 1997, PAG is a global organization with multiple office locations: worldwide headquarters in Los Angeles; San Diego, Colorado and Japan showrooms, as well as manufacturing offices located throughout mainland China. The royalty arrangement obligates PAG to pay the Company 12% of sales during an 18-month engagement and also calls for royalty guarantee payments during subsequent renewal terms. This agreement is no longer in existence and the THC trademark was being utilized by PVI for consumer products per the Share Exchange Agreement.

In July 2017, the Company entered into a Patent Assignment Agreement with Sky Island, Inc. for the assignment of the patent of the Top Shelf System, along with the opportunity to sell the Safe Display System. The Company will pay Sky Island, Inc. 30% of the gross sales price of each unit as a royalty payment. If a unit is leased, the Company will pay Sky Island, Inc. 30% of any lease payments made to the Company.
 
On September 20, 2018, the Company entered into a Website Licensing Agreement with PVI. Two websites, www.pineappleexpress.com and www.thc.com, were being used by PVI and Pineapple. The Company received a royalty from all sales made from these websites through the Website Licensing Agreement. This agreement was made non-effective per the Share Exchange Agreement with PVI. As of the filing date of this Annual Report, the www.thc.com domain has been returned to Ramsey Houston Salem as disclosed in Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) herein pursuant to an arbitration award.
 
As further discussed herein, on December 17, 2020, PVI purchased from the Company all trade dress and trade names, logos, internet addresses and domain names, trademarks and service marks, and related registrations and applications, including any intent to use applications, supplemental registrations and any renewals or extensions, all other indicia of commercial source or origin, and all goodwill of any business associated with any of the foregoing.
 
Properties
 
PVI and its affiliates (as mentioned above) require significant real estate to conduct its cannabis cultivation, production, and distribution services. The strategy is to lease existing structures to operate its businesses and/or sub-lease to clients for cannabis related purposes following development of the premises to provide the sub-tenant a suitable space for the business purpose.
 
Beginning in 2019 and as of the date of this Annual Report, the Company’s properties are as follows:
 

● | 9,859 sq ft of leased space in Los Angeles, CA 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 6,000 sq ft of leased space in Palm Springs, CA 
● | 3,600 sq ft of leased space in Hollywood, CA 

 
On October 12, 2016, Better Business Consultants, Inc.’s, Pineapple Express One, LLC’s (“PE1”), and Pineapple Express Two, LLC’s (“PE2”) rights under a purchase contract with United Pentecostal Church of Desert Hot Springs (“UPCDHS”) to purchase 3.78 acres and existing building structures was terminated by UPCDHS. BBC, PE1, and PE2 were unsuccessful in recouping any of the $1.5 million in costs associated with deposits to UPCDHS towards the acquisition of the parcel, as well as paid and unpaid development costs expended regarding the parcel. BBC, PE1, and PE2 attempted to resolve the matter amicably with UPCDHS and the ultimate acquirer of the parcel, which gained the benefit of the development costs expended by BBC, PE1, and PE2 in improving the value of the parcel as well as the conditional use permit tied to the real estate. As a result, BBC, PE1, and PE2 were sold by us to a related party and our majority shareholder, Jaime Ortega. Mr. Ortega, the new owner of BBC, PE1, and PE2, advised management that he would address the matter with UPCDHS as well as the purchaser of the parcel, and also resolve any debts to vendors that went unpaid, through litigation. As of this date, this action was found to be the culmination of a multiplicity of actions and cross-actions arising from the claims to title relating to certain real property more commonly known as 65241 San Jacinto Lane, Desert Hot Springs, California, 92240-5014 and construction disputes for building projects thereon. BBC, PE1 and PE2 were dismissed from this action and will only be subject to a deficiency judgment, if any, when the property is sold.
 
On April 5, 2017, the Company entered into a real estate purchase transaction for a 1.26-acre parcel of land in Desert Hot Springs, CA (the “Desert Hot Springs Property”). The Desert Hot Springs Property purchase was finalized on July 24, 2017, for $700,000 and the Company took possession of the Desert Hot Springs Property. In order to finance this purchase, the Company borrowed $700,000 from a related party entity, Sky Island, Inc., controlled by our majority shareholder, Jaime Ortega.

On June 20, 2017, the Desert Hot Springs Property was sold to Hawkeye, LLC in order to reduce a debt owed to them by the Company.
 
In March 2019, PVI entered into lease agreements related to two new locations, 9367 Cassia Road and 16441 Beaver Road in Adelanto CA, totaling 37,750 square feet of rentable warehouse space. PVI and its tenants of these properties never moved in and eventually moved the project to Chatsworth, CA.
 
In October 2020, PVI entered into a lease agreement related to a location at 1704 Vine Street in Hollywood CA, totaling 3,600 square feet of rentable retail space. This property is currently under construction and is expected to be ready to operate in February 2022.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company, excluding its subsidiaries, had no full-time employees, four independent contractors, and no part-time employees.
