ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company,” “Guardion” the “Company” and the “Registrant” refer to Guardion Health Sciences, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
We are a clinical nutrition company that develops and distributes clinically supported nutrition, including foods and dietary supplements. We offer a portfolio of science-based, clinically supported products designed to support consumers in achieving their health goals.
 
Our profile and focus fundamentally changed with the acquisition of Activ Nutritional, LLC (“Activ” or “Viactiv” as the context requires) in June 2021, the owner and distributor of the Viactiv® line of supplements for bone health, immune health and other applications.
 
The acquisition and integration of the Viactiv line of products has changed our financial position, market profile and brand focus, and has also expanded our search for additional business opportunities in the short-term, both internal and external.
 
We believe the Activ acquisition added valuable attributes, including (1) Viactiv’s brand awareness and acceptance from the consumer; (2) experienced management; (3) established distribution networks and relationships; (4) product development potential; and (5) a long track record of revenue growth and profitability.
 

● | Brand awareness – Viactiv was initially launched by industry leaders Mead Johnson/Johnson & Johnson approximately twenty years ago, and we believe this history, along with the product’s marketing campaigns, taste profile and receipt of consistently positive consumer reviews, have led to strong consumer awareness and acceptance. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Experienced management – As part of the Activ acquisition, we appointed Craig Sheehan as our Chief Commercial Officer. Mr. Sheehan was the senior executive responsible for the Viactiv brand as a member of the executive leadership team of Adare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Adare”), the previous owner of Viactiv. 
● | Established distribution – Viactiv’s products are currently marketed through many of the nation’s largest retailers, including, among others, Walmart (retail and online), Target, CVS and Amazon. 
● | Track record of profitability – Viactiv generated net revenues of approximately $11,900,000 and operating income of approximately $1,200,000 in the year-ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis and assuming Viactiv was owned by the Company for the entire year, our total revenues would have been $12,765,911 and the Viactiv products would have accounted for 96% of our pro forma total revenues for the period. We expect the acquisition of Viactiv to contribute increasing revenue and consistent operating margins and profitability, as well as a multitude of growth opportunities, to our Company. 

 
Acquisition of Activ Nutritional, LLC
 
On June 1, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Activ. The acquisition was made pursuant to an Equity Purchase Agreement, dated May 18, 2021, between us, Adare and Activ. We acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity of Activ from Adare for $26 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Equity Purchase Agreement.
 
Activ owns the Viactiv® line of supplement chews for bone health, immune health and other applications which are currently marketed through many of the nation’s largest retailers, including, among others, Walmart (retail and online), Target and Amazon. The Viactiv product lines will be our most prominent product lines for the foreseeable future absent any additional significant acquisitions.

Recent Developments
 
Equity Distribution Agreement
 
On January 28, 2022, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Maxim Group LLC, and Roth Capital Partners LLC as co-agents (collectively, the “Agents”), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through the Agents, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $25,000,000 in one or more at-the-market offerings. As of March 25, 2022, we have not sold any shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. As a result of the February Offering (described below), we are restricted from utilizing the at-the-market offering for a period of time.
February 2022 Securities Offering
 
On February 18, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which we issued and sold, in a best-efforts offering by the Company (the “February Offering”), (i) 32,550,000 units, priced at an offering price of $0.30 per unit, with each unit consisting of one share of our common stock, one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.37 per share that expires on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance (“Series A Warrant”) and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.37 per share that expires on the eighteen month anniversary of the date of issuance ( “Series B Warrant”), and (ii) 4,450,000 pre-funded units, priced at an offering price of $0.2999 per unit, with each unit consisting of one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share that is exercisable at any time after issuance until exercised in full (a “Pre-Funded Warrant” and together with the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants, the “Warrants”), one Series A Warrant and one Series B Warrant.
 
On February 18, 2022, we entered into a Placement Agency Agreement (the “Placement Agency Agreement”) with the Agents pursuant to which we paid the Agents an aggregate fee equal to 7.0% of the gross proceeds from the units sold in the February Offering and reimbursed the Agents $100,000 for expenses incurred in connection with the February Offering. In addition, we issued Roth warrants (the “Placement Agent Warrants”) to purchase up to 1,850,000 shares of our common stock exercisable at an exercise price of $0.37 per share. The Placement Agent Warrants will be exercisable immediately and expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of the issuance.
 
On February 23, 2022, we closed the February Offering, and issued (i) 32,550,000 shares of common stock, (ii) Series A Warrants to purchase 37,000,000 shares of common stock, (iii) Series B Warrants to purchase 37,000,000 shares of common stock, and (iv) Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase 4,450,000 shares of common stock. The net proceeds from the February Offering, after deducting the placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us were approximately $10.0 million. In the event that the Company fails to deliver shares by the required delivery date upon exercise of the warrants, the Company may be subject to cash penalties in an amount up to $20 per trading day for each $1,000 of warrant shares until such shares are delivered. In addition, if the warrant holder purchases shares in the market following the Company’s failure to deliver shares upon exercise of the warrants, the Company will be required to cover the cost of any buy-ins and, at the option of the warrant holder, either reinstate the portion of the warrant for the shares that were not delivered or deliver the number of shares that should have been issued.
 
In connection with the February Offering, we and our executive officers and directors entered into lock-up agreements providing that we and each of our executive officers and directors, subject to limited exceptions, may not offer, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of our Company’s securities for a period of (i) 90 days for executive officers and directors and (ii) 120 days for our Company following the February Offering, without the prior written approval of Roth (and in the case of our Company lockup, Roth and the investors party to the Securities Purchase Agreement).
 
In addition, until the 18 month anniversary of the February Offering, we are prohibited from entering into a variable rate transaction (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), provided, however, we will be permitted to utilize the at-the-market offering facility, described above, commencing 120 days following the closing of the February Offering.
 
On February 18, 2022, we entered into a warrant agency agreement with our transfer agent, VStock Transfer, LLC, who will also act as our warrant agent, setting forth the terms and conditions of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants sold in the February Offering.

Product Offerings
 
Our product profile and focus fundamentally changed with the acquisition of Activ in June 2021, the owner and distributor of the Viactiv® line of supplements for bone health, immune health and other applications. In 2021, sales of the Viactiv line of supplements represented approximately 90% of our consolidated net sales. The Viactiv line of supplements contains several flavored nutritional supplement products, but the milk chocolate and caramel flavored calcium chews constitute the main product category.
 
Viactiv was first introduced to the market over 20 years ago as a calcium-fortified soft chew intended to deliver clinical nutrition to women in a way that is enjoyable to taste and easy to consume. Since the original chocolatey-chew, multiple chews have been introduced, each delivering nutrition to help consumers maintain health goals, such as strong bones and immune support. Viactiv is regulated in the U.S. as a dietary supplement.
 
We also sell Lumega-Z, our medical food product that has a formula designed to replenish and restore the macular protective pigment, simultaneously delivering critical and essential nutrients to the eye. The current formulation has been delivered to patients and used in clinics since 2019.
 
As a medical food, Lumega-Z must be administered under the supervision of a physician or professional healthcare provider. We also use a variety of marketing strategies to increase awareness of Lumega-Z among ophthalmologists and optometrists. We also market Lumega-Z through direct-to-consumer strategies such as social media and paid search advertising.
 
In 2020, two peer-review scientific articles were published demonstrating the beneficial efficacy of Lumega-Z®. Both articles were published in the journal Nutrients. The first published study assessed the level of absorption of the carotenoids in Lumega-Z compared to absorption of the carotenoids in the industry leading eye vitamin, PreserVisionTM (AREDS 2 formula sold by Bausch and Lomb), and determined whether an elevated level of carotenoid absorption leads to increased macular pigment optical density (“MPOD”). The study found that despite only a 2.3-fold higher carotenoid concentration than PreserVisionTM, Lumega-Z supplementation provides approximately 3–4-fold higher absorption, which leads to a significant elevation of MPOD levels. The second study evaluated the visual benefits in a group of patients taking Lumega-Z compared to a group of patients taking AREDS 2 (PreserVisionTM) soft gel supplements, as well as a third control group that were ocular normals taking no supplements. Each study participant had retinal drusen, delayed dark adaptation recovery time and was at risk of developing vision loss from age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”). The results showed significant improvements in visual function, as measured by contrast sensitivity, in the group of patients taking Lumega-Z. The patients taking PreserVisionTM showed a trend toward an improvement, but no statistical change, while the control group showed no change.
 
GlaucoCetin, also currently considered a medical food, offers a formula that is designed to support proper mitochondrial function in the optic nerve cells in glaucoma patients. Loss of optic nerve cells is thought to be the primary cause of vision loss in glaucoma patients. Like Lumega-Z, we market GlaucoCetin through direct-to-consumer strategies such as social media and paid search advertising. We also use a variety of marketing strategies to increase awareness of GlaucoCetin among ophthalmologists and optometrists.
 
We distribute Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin through E-commerce, in an online store that is operated at www.guardionhealth.com, and we intend to expand our E-commerce capabilities in 2022.
 
Prior Product Offerings
 
Nutriguard: We had marketed a brand of dietary supplement products under the NutriGuard brand, which we acquired in 2019, but decided to stop marketing the brand after acquiring the Viactiv line of supplements in June of 2021. ImmuneSF, a unique proprietary nutraceutical formulation designed to support and maintain an effective immune system was the first product developed after the acquisition of NutriGuard. This formulation contained a synergistic blend of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients. While we still intend to build a portfolio of nutraceutical products, we plan to launch such products under the Viactiv brand rather than the NutriGuard brand.

VectorVision, CSV-1000 and CSV-2000: In September 2017, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary VectorVision Ocular Health, Inc., acquired VectorVision, Inc. (“VectorVision”), a company that specialized in the standardization of contrast sensitivity, glare sensitivity, low contrast acuity, and early treatment diabetic retinopathy study visual acuity testing. VectorVision’s standardization system  is designed to provide the practitioner or researcher with the ability to delineate very small changes in visual capability, either as compared to the population or from visit to visit. VectorVision developed, manufactured and sold equipment and supplies for standardized vision testing for use by eye doctors in clinics, for researchers to use in clinical trials, for real-world vision evaluation, and industrial vision testing.
 
During December 2021, as part of management’s comprehensive evaluation of our Company’s business and in order to focus on those brands and lines of business that management believes provide the greatest growth opportunities, we determined to restructure the operations of our VectorVision business. We are completing the process of substantially winding down the day-to-day operations of VectorVision, which is expected to significantly reduce costs, and we intend to explore various alternative ways to preserve, manage and exploit our intellectual property rights, including our U.S. patents, associated with the VectorVision technology. We are exploring both domestic and international business opportunities, such as licensing and distribution arrangements, with experienced parties, which could assist us in the economic exploitation of these intellectual property rights. As a result of this change to the VectorVision business strategy, management believes that it will be able to better focus its efforts and deploy capital resources to more growth-oriented brands and product lines, like Viactiv, and other products in development, that it hopes to bring to market in 2022.
 
Competitive Advantage and Strategy
 
Dietary Supplements
 
We intend to formulate high quality scientifically credible dietary supplements with a goal to become a globally respected clinical nutrition company. We believe our dietary supplements can play an important role in optimizing, preserving and restoring health.
 
Our products compete primarily in the consumer product category of dietary supplements. Successfully competing in this category requires a continuous flow of new products and line extensions, and significant sales and marketing expenses. We will also invest in research and development that will help guide our new product development process. We will compete in this category primarily on the basis of product innovation and performance, brand recognition, price, value and other consumer benefits. Consumer products, particularly dietary supplements, are subject to significant price competition. As a result, we, from time to time, may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share. Product introductions typically involve heavy marketing and trade spending in the year of launch, and we usually are not able to determine whether the new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line.
 
Our products are marketed primarily through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, and other discount and other specialty stores, and websites and other e-commerce channels, all of which sell our products to consumers. We also utilize the services of independent brokers, who represent our products in the food, mass, club, and numerous other classes of trade. Our products are stored in third-party owned warehouses and are delivered by independent trucking companies.
 
Medical Foods
 
Lumega-Z is a medical food designed to enhance the bioavailability of “difficult to absorb” ingredients like carotenoids. In contrast to other formulations, Lumega-Z is a liquid formulated using a proprietary molecular micronization process (“MMP”) to maximize efficiency of absorption and to minimize compatibility issues. The MMP is a proprietary homogenization process whereby the particle size of the ingredients is reduced to facilitate more efficient absorption into the body. As noted earlier, clinical studies have shown Lumega-Z offers significantly higher absorption of carotenoids, than the leading AREDS-based formula PreserVisionTM. In a subsequent study, Lumega-Z was also found to provide significantly better vision benefit than the AREDS-based formula in patients with drusen and at risk of vision loss from AMD, as measured by contrast sensitivity. We believe we have an advantage with Lumega-Z because of these two published studies showing superiority over the leading formula, PreserVisionTM, and because a growing body of evidence, particularly the results from the AREDS studies, has demonstrated the importance of supplementation with carotenoids to offset vision loss in patients with macular degeneration. Lumega-Z has demonstrated in studies to have higher absorption of carotenoids, which we believe may lead to better visual outcomes and a superiority over the competitive formulas.

GlaucoCetin is a medical food designed to support mitochondrial function in the optic nerve cells of glaucoma patients. For glaucoma, the primary risk factor for disease progression has been thought to be elevated intraocular pressure which in turn damages the optic nerve cells leading to vision loss. As such, the primary means for treating the disease, to slow or stop vision loss, is to lower the intraocular pressure through pharmaceutical or surgical means. We believe that we have an advantage with GlaucoCetin because it is designed to offset the mitochondrial dysfunction of cells in glaucoma patients.
 
Growth Strategy
 
We believe that developing new products, growing our established distribution and cost effectively marketing our products are the keys to growing our business. We have several innovation initiatives underway that are aimed at increasing the number of new products in our product portfolio and expanding our total addressable market, and we plan to grow our established distribution network. Our current network includes many of the nation’s largest retailers, including, among others, Walmart (retail and online), Target, CVS and Amazon. We are also focused on our direct-to-consumer website. We are working to add additional retailers that sell our products and adding new sales channels. We are also focused on marketing initiatives that strengthen our brand and target consumers who would benefit most from our specific products. We also intend to explore the acquisition of other companies, product lines and intellectual property rights that may be complementary or supplementary as part of our efforts to expand our business.
Sales
 
Viactiv has traditionally sold the majority of its products through traditional retailers via third party brokers. We have continued to utilize these brokers to sell the Viactiv products to retailers rather than employing an internal sales force. Online retailers have represented a smaller portion of sales, but we believe these sales can be meaningful and play an important role in our eCommerce strategy. In addition, we sell a limited amount of Viactiv products directly to consumers via our website, and plan to invest in this channel to grow sales. While the footprint for our direct-to-consumer channel is currently small, we expect this channel to play an important role in our new product launches and growth. Furthermore, the Company is evaluating its medical food product portfolio in order to determine whether it would be advantageous to fold those products into the Viactiv brand of supplements and utilize those distribution channels.
Marketing – Digital
 
We are focused on marketing initiatives that strengthen our brand and target consumers who would benefit most from our products. We utilize digital marketing for the majority of our marketing expenditures, and we believe that such methods have been among the most cost-effective way to market our products.
Marketing – Practitioners
 
Healthcare practitioners are important stakeholders for our products, especially Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin. We have deemphasized our direct sales approach that involved our sales representatives in favor of a more cost-effective approach to increase the awareness of our products with health care practitioners. This approach is designed to increase marketing reach through a combination of collaboration with industry-specific publishers, peer-to-peer promotion using key opinion leader clinicians, organic and paid search engine optimization and marketing, and other content-driven and educational approaches.
Domestic and International Expansion Strategy
 
We are primarily focused on expanding our business domestically rather than internationally. The acquisition of Activ in 2021 shifted our strategic focus towards the Viactiv line of supplements, which has historically focused on domestic markets. As a result, the domestic markets allow us to leverage Viactiv’s strong consumer brand awareness, distribution networks and key third party vendors relationships.

Although we have decreased our focus on international expansion, we maintain relationships that we hope will lead to increased distribution of our existing products and unique nutritional formulations in Asian markets. In March 2020, we received our first order for a novel immune support product from a Malaysian company, which order was valued at $890,000 and we believe that we could have similar opportunities in the future.
 
Intellectual Property

Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes and methods, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the U.S. and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our products and proprietary information through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
Patents
 
We currently own and have exclusive rights to four U.S. patents, one Canadian patent, and one Hong Kong patent application with respect to various products and product candidates, as follows:
 
(1) U.S. Patent No. 9,486,136 entitled “Apparatus for Use in the Measurement of Macular Pigment Optical Density and/or Lens Optical Density of an Eye,” issued on November 8, 2016.

* The patents marked with an asterisk are assigned to VectorVision Ocular Health, Inc.
 
Trademarks
 
We prominently display our trademarks on all Guardion and Viactiv products and believe that having distinctive trademarks is an important factor in the promotion and marketing our product offerings. We have acquired or are in the process of acquiring registered protection for the trademarks most critical to our business. We currently have ten trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and three applications pending before the USPTO, all of which are used in association with the Guardion line of products. In addition, we have six trademarks registered with the USPTO which are used in association with the Viactiv line of products.
 
Furthermore, we have 11 trademarks currently registered in foreign jurisdictions for use with our Guardion line of products, and we have 15 registrations for the Viactiv trademark in a broad range of geographies. We are evaluating whether additional foreign trademark protection may be appropriate. The domestic and foreign trademark registrations/applications referred to herein are set forth in the table below:

Products Manufacturing and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We outsource the manufacturing of our medical food products and dietary supplement product line to contract manufacturers. We process orders through purchase orders and invoices with each manufacturer. We believe that there are alternative sources, suppliers and manufacturers available for our products in the event of a termination or a disagreement with any current vendor.

Government Regulation
 
Dietary Supplement Regulation
 
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has primary jurisdiction for the regulation of dietary supplements. The FDA regulates dietary supplements, such as Viactiv chews, as “dietary supplements” under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) as a distinct, sub-category of “food.” Dietary supplements must meet the requirements of applicable food laws and regulations. A “dietary supplement” is defined under the FDCA as “a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs or other botanicals; a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of the ingredients listed above.” Dietary supplements are intended to enhance the diet and may not be represented as a conventional food or as the sole item of a meal or diet.
 
Dietary supplements do not require approval from the FDA before they are marketed. Except in the case of a “new dietary ingredient,” where pre-market review for safety data and other information is required by law, a firm is not required to provide the FDA with the evidence it relies on to substantiate safety or effectiveness before marketing a supplement product.
 
A manufacturer or distributor must notify the FDA if it intends to market a dietary supplement in the U.S. that contains a “new dietary ingredient.” A new dietary ingredient is an ingredient first marketed as or in a dietary supplement after October 15, 1994. The manufacturer must demonstrate to the FDA that the new ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe for use in a dietary supplement. There is no authoritative list of dietary ingredients that were marketed before October 15, 1994. Therefore, manufacturers are responsible for determining if a dietary ingredient is “new.”
 
Owners or responsible parties of any facilities at which dietary supplements are manufactured, packaged, labeled, or held for distribution must register the facility or facilities with FDA pursuant to the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (“Bioterrorism Act”) before producing supplements. Manufacturers of dietary supplements also must follow current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) regulations. Entities that manufacture, package, label or hold dietary supplement products must follow applicable cGMP regulations. These regulations focus on practices that ensure the identity, purity, quality, strength and composition of dietary supplements. We engage with contract manufacturers to manufacture our dietary supplements.
 
Companies are responsible for determining that the dietary supplements they manufacture or distribute are safe, and that any representations or claims made about them are substantiated by adequate evidence to show that the claims are not false or misleading. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has the primary responsibility to regulate the advertising of foods, including dietary supplements. Under the FTC Act, all advertising claims, both express and implied, must be truthful, non-misleading, and substantiated. In practice, the FDA and FTC share jurisdiction over promotional practices and monitor the promotion and advertising of dietary supplements in multiple media forms, including TV, radio, social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), and the internet.
 
Dietary supplements also are subject to the Nutrition, Labeling and Education Act, which regulates health claims, ingredient labeling, and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in a product. Dietary supplements may be intended to affect the structure or function of the human body. If the label of a dietary supplement contains such structure/function claims, the label must bear the disclaimer: “This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” We are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and truthfulness of all product claims.
 
Medical Foods Regulation
 
The FDA is primarily responsible for regulating medical foods. A medical food is defined under the FDCA as a “food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.”

The FDA advises that it considers the statutory definition of medical foods to “narrowly” constrain the types of products that fit within the category of food. FDA regulations further describe medical foods as a product that: (i) is a specially formulated and processed product (as opposed to a naturally occurring foodstuff used in its natural state) for the partial or exclusive feeding of a patient by means of oral intake or enteral feeding by tube; (ii) is intended for the dietary management of a patient who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or who has other special medically determined nutrient requirements, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone; (iii) provides nutritional support specifically modified for the management of the unique nutrient needs that result from the specific disease or condition, as determined by medical evaluation; (iv) is intended to be used under medical supervision; and (v) is intended only for a patient receiving active and ongoing medical supervision wherein the patient requires medical care on a recurring basis for, among other things, instructions on the use of the medical food.
 
Medical foods do not require approval or review by the FDA prior to marketing. However, a company must have data to demonstrate that the formula, when taken as directed, meets the distinctive nutritional requirements of the particular disease or condition.
 
We currently consider our Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin products to be medical foods. Like any evolving area, especially where no premarket approval is required, the FDA reserves the right to raise questions about the qualification of products within any category. If the FDA were to disagree and consider our medical foods to be “drugs” under the FDCA, we and our products would be subject to considerable additional FDA regulation.
 
The labeling for medical foods must comply with all applicable food labeling requirements, except for those specific requirements from which medical foods are exempt. Medical foods are exempt, for example, from the labeling requirements for nutrient content claims and health claims under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. As with all food labels, printing must be legible, and many required elements must be conspicuous, such as a statement of identity, which is the name of the food; the statement: “Must be administered under the supervision of a physician or professional healthcare provider;” the quantity; the ingredients listing; the name and address of the distributor, among other requirements.
 
All ingredients in foods must be either generally recognized as safe (“GRAS”) or approved food-additives. Many ingredients have been determined by the FDA to be GRAS and are listed as such by regulation. Other ingredients may achieve self-affirmed GRAS status through a panel of experts on that particular substance that author a GRAS report. The standard for an ingredient to achieve GRAS status requires not only technical demonstration of non-toxicity and safety, but also general recognition and agreement on that safety by experts in the field. All ingredients used in our medical foods are either FDA-approved food additives or have GRAS status.
 
Foods manufacturers must register with the FDA pursuant to the Bioterrorism Act before producing foods. Manufacturers of foods also must follow cGMP regulations applicable to foods. Entities that manufacture, package, label or hold food products must follow applicable cGMP regulations. These regulations focus on practices that ensure sanitary and cleanly conditions of manufacturing facilities. We engage contract manufacturers to manufacture Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin.
 
The FTC has the primary responsibility to regulate the advertising of foods. Under the FTC Act, all advertising claims, both express and implied, must be truthful, non-misleading, and substantiated.
 
Enforcement by the regulators is post-market, mostly via FDA inspections of food manufacturing facilities, including packaging, distribution facilities, and fulfillment houses. The FDA and FTC also gathers material at trade shows and conferences and review company websites and social media accounts.

Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
Stark Law
 
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 prohibits certain physician self-referrals. This law and its supporting regulations, which have been amended and expanded substantially, are commonly referred to as the “Stark Law,” and prohibit a physician from making any referral of a Designated Health Service (“DHS”) to an entity that furnishes or bills for DHS (a “DHS Entity”) and with which the physician has a financial relationship, and prohibits DHS Entities from billing for any DHS that is referred, unless all of the requirements of a regulatory exception are met. Stark covered DHS include both outpatient prescription drugs and diagnostic testing that are reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have similar laws (“State Self-Referral Prohibitions”), some of which can apply to all payors and not just governmental payors.
 
At present, neither Lumega Z nor GlaucoCetin are outpatient prescription drugs nor are they reimbursable under any federal program. Further, we do not furnish any DHS to patients, nor bill any DHS to any federal program. We believe that the federal Stark Law is thus inapplicable. Further, we believe that State Self-Referral Prohibitions are unlikely to apply for similar reasons. To the extent that the products might become reimbursable under a federal program, or otherwise become covered under the Stark Law, we believe that the physicians who recommend our medical foods, Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin, to their patients are aware of Stark Law and State Self-Referral Prohibition requirements. However, we do not monitor their compliance and have no assurance that the physicians are in material compliance with the Stark Law or State Self-Referral Prohibitions. If it were determined that the physicians who prescribe medical foods purchased from us were not in compliance with the Stark Law or State Self-Referral Prohibitions, it could potentially have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Anti-Kickback Statute
 
The federal anti-kickback statute (the “AKS”) applies to Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal programs. AKS prohibits the solicitation, offer, payment or receipt of remuneration in return for referrals of the purchase, or in return for recommending or arranging for the referral or purchase, of goods, including drugs, covered by the federal health care programs. At present, we do not participate in any federal programs and our products are not reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or any other state or federal program. The AKS is a criminal statute with criminal penalties, as well as potential civil and administrative penalties. The AKS, however, provides a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory “safe harbors” for particular types of transactions. Many states have similar fraud and abuse laws and their own anti-kickback laws, some of which can apply to all payors, and not just governmental payors. While we believe that we are in material compliance with both federal and state AKS laws, the AKS laws present different levels of risks as to our sale of our medical foods, Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin.
 
At present, our products are not reimbursable under any federal program. If, however, that changes in the future and we determine that we are not in compliance with the AKS, we could be subject to liability, and our operations could be curtailed. Moreover, if the activities of our customers or other entity with which we have a business relationship were found to constitute a violation of the AKS and we, as a result of the provision of products or services to such customer or entity, were found to have knowingly participated in such activities, we could be subject to sanctions or liability under such laws, including civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as exclusion from government health programs. As a result of exclusion from government health programs, neither products nor services could be provided to any beneficiaries of any federal healthcare program.
 
The Federal False Claims Act
 
The Federal False Claims Act provides for the imposition of extensive financial penalties (including treble damages and fines of over $22,000 for every false claim) if a provider submits false claims to any governmental health program either knowingly or in reckless disregard or in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the claims at issue. Liability under the False Claims Act can arise from patterns of deficient documentation, coding and billing, as well as for billing for services that are deemed not to have been medically necessary for the treatment of the patient. Many states have their own False Claims Acts as well.

-16-

To the extent we were billing governmental health care programs, the False Claims Act may potentially be applicable to such operations. We put a fraud and abuse compliance program in place that was designed to ensure that our documentation, coding and billing were accurate and compliant. Any patterns of uncorrected deficiencies in documenting, coding and billing, however, may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
 
State Regulatory Requirements
 
Each state has its own regulations concerning physician dispensing, restrictions on the Corporate Practice of Medicine (“CPOM”), anti-kickback and false claim regulations. In addition, each state has a board of pharmacy that regulates the sale and distribution of drugs and other therapeutic agents. Some states require that a physician obtain a license to dispense prescription products. When considering the commencement of business in a new state, we consult with healthcare counsel regarding the expansion of operations and utilize local counsel when necessary.
Other United States Regulatory Requirements
 
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of food and medical devices products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws. In addition, we may be subject to federal and state laws requiring the disclosure of financial arrangements with health care professionals.
Foreign Regulatory Requirements
 
We may eventually be subject to widely varying foreign regulations, which may be quite different from those of the FDA, governing clinical trials, product design, manufacturing, labeling, product registration and approval, and sales. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, generally we must obtain separate authorization for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the commencement of product marketing in those countries. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. The authorization or approval process varies from country to country.
Employees
 
As of March 25, 2022, we, including our subsidiaries, had a total of 13 full-time employees. and no part-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
Science Advisory Board
 
Our research and development efforts are shaped by our Science Advisory Board, a product development and research team composed of industry experts in clinical nutrition. This team is committed to revealing and validating the connections between health and nutrition and then developing products based on these findings. Their joint goal is the integration of a medical model incorporating nutritional therapy into clinical practice. 
 
In addition to developing products based on scientific studies in the public domain, members of our Science Advisory Board conduct and publish their own evidence. Their expertise and the evidence they develop guide the formulation of all of our products.
