ITEM 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Company Overview
Sotheby’s has been uniting collectors with world-class works of art1 since 1744. Today, Sotheby's offers property from more than 70 collecting categories to clients from 130 countries and presents auctions in ten different salesrooms, including New York, London, Hong Kong and Paris, and Sotheby’s BidNow program allows clients to view all auctions live online and place bids from anywhere in the world. We also offer collectors a variety of innovative art-related services, including the brokerage of private art sales, private jewelry sales through Sotheby's Diamonds, exclusive private selling exhibitions, art-related financing, and art advisory services, as well as retail wine locations in New York and Hong Kong.
As successor to a business that began in 1744, Sotheby's is the oldest company listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") (symbol: BID) and is the only publicly traded investment opportunity in the art market. Sotheby's is incorporated in Delaware.
Business Organization
Our operations are organized under two segments—the Agency segment and the Finance segment, which does business as and is referred to in this report as Sotheby’s Financial Services (“SFS”). The Agency segment earns commissions and fees by acting as agent for clients wishing to sell their artworks through the auction or private sale process. To a much lesser extent, the Agency segment also earns revenues from the sale of artworks that are owned by Sotheby's. SFS earns interest income and associated fees through art-related financing activities by making loans that are secured by works of art. Art Agency, Partners (“AAP”), which was acquired on January 11, 2016 and through which we offer art advisory services, provides art collectors with strategic guidance on collection identity and development, acquisitions, and short and long-term planning, and provides advice to artists and artists' estates. In addition, from time-to-time, AAP brokers private art sales for its advisory clients. Our advisory services are classified within All Other for segment reporting purposes, along with our retail wine business and brand licensing activities, and the results from certain equity method investments. (See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our segment reporting.)
Agency Segment
Through our Agency segment, we accept works of art on consignment and match sellers (also known as consignors) to buyers through the auction or private sale process. In both auction and private sale transactions, we act as exclusive agent for the seller. Prior to offering a work of art for sale, we perform due diligence activities to authenticate and determine the ownership history and condition of the consigned artwork. (See “Converting Consignment Opportunities” below for further information regarding the consignment process.) 
As compensation for our auction services, we earn a commission from both the buyer ("buyer's premium") and, to a lesser extent, the seller ("seller's commission") (collectively, "auction commission revenue"), both of which are calculated as a percentage of the hammer price of the property sold at auction. In certain situations, in order to secure a high-value consignment, we may not charge a seller's commission and/or may share a portion of our buyer's premium with the seller. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, auction commission revenues accounted for approximately 74%, 66%, and 75%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Private sale commission revenues are earned through the direct brokering of purchases and sales of art. Private sales are generally initiated by a client wishing to sell their artwork (i.e., the consignor) with Sotheby's acting as its exclusive agent in the transaction. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, private sale commission revenues accounted for approximately 8%, 6%, and 6%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues.
__________
1 In this report, the term "works of art" is meant to include authenticated fine art, decorative art, jewelry, wine, and collectibles, and may also be referred to as "art," "artwork," or "property."

Under the standard terms and conditions of our auction sales, we are not obligated to pay the consignor for property that has not been paid for by the buyer. If a buyer defaults on payment, the sale is cancelled, and the property is returned to the consignor. Alternatively, the consignor may reoffer the property at one of our future auctions or negotiate a private sale with us acting as their agent. In certain instances and subject to management approval under our internal corporate governance policy, we may pay the net sale proceeds to the seller before payment is collected from the buyer and/or we may allow the buyer to take possession of the property before making payment. In situations when the buyer takes possession of the property before making payment, we are liable to the seller for the net sale proceeds whether or not the buyer makes payment.
From time-to-time in the ordinary course of business, we will provide a guarantee to the consignor that their consigned artwork will achieve a specified minimum sale price at auction. This type of arrangement is known as an auction guarantee. If the property offered under an auction guarantee sells above the minimum guaranteed price, we are generally entitled to a share of the overage. In the event that the property sells for less than the minimum guaranteed price, we must perform under the auction guarantee by funding the shortfall between the sale price at auction and the amount of the auction guarantee. If the property offered under the auction guarantee does not sell, we must pay the amount of the auction guarantee to the consignor and then take ownership of the unsold property and may recover the amount paid through its future sale. In certain limited situations, if the guaranteed property fails to sell at auction or if the purchaser defaults, the consignor has the right to cancel the auction guarantee and retain the property. 
We may reduce our financial exposure under auction guarantees through contractual risk sharing arrangements. Such auction guarantee risk sharing arrangements include irrevocable bid arrangements and, from time-to-time, partner sharing arrangements. In exchange for accepting a share of the financial exposure under the auction guarantee, our counterparties to these arrangements may receive a fee for providing the irrevocable bid, and are generally entitled to receive a share of our auction commission if the property sells and/or a share of the overage, if any.
Auction guarantees are an important financial incentive which may significantly influence an art collector's decision on whether and how to sell their property. As such, auction guarantees provide us the opportunity to secure highly sought-after consignments, often well in advance of a specific selling season. When we evaluate the performance of our portfolio of auction guarantees, we take into consideration the overall net revenues earned on the transaction, which includes our auction commission revenue, as well as any overage or shortfall. Depending on the mix of items subject to an auction guarantee, in advance of peak selling seasons, a small number of guaranteed items may represent a substantial portion of the aggregate amount of outstanding auction guarantees. 
 (See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for a discussion of the overall financial performance of the Agency segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about auction guarantees.)
Sotheby's Financial Services
SFS is an art financing company that operates as a niche lender with the ability to tailor attractive financing packages for clients who wish to obtain immediate access to liquidity from their art assets. SFS leverages the art expertise of the Agency segment, skill in international law and finance, and access to capital to provide art collectors and dealers with financing secured by their works of art, allowing them to unlock the value in their collections. A considerable number of traditional lending sources offer conventional loans at a lower cost to borrowers than the average cost of loans offered by SFS and many traditional lenders offer borrowers a variety of integrated financial services such as wealth management. Few lenders, however, are willing to accept works of art as sole collateral for loans, as they do not have access to market information allowing them to effectively appraise collateral during the life of a loan, nor do they have the wherewithal to efficiently monetize loan collateral.
SFS makes term loans secured by artworks that are not presently intended for sale, allowing us to establish or enhance mutually beneficial relationships with art collectors. Term loans may also generate future auction or private sale consignments through the sale of the collateral at the conclusion of the loan and/or through future purchases of new property by the borrower. In certain situations, term loans are made to refinance the accounts receivable balances generated by the auction and private sale purchases of our clients. Term loans normally have an initial maturity of one year with an option to renew for an additional year, and typically carry a variable market rate of interest. To a much lesser extent, SFS also makes consignor advances secured by artworks that are contractually committed, in the near term, to be offered for sale through the Agency segment. Consignor advances allow sellers to receive funds upon consignment for an auction or private sale that will occur up to one year in the future and normally have short-term maturities.

Our previous credit agreements provided for dedicated asset-based revolving credit facilities for the Agency segment (the "Agency Credit Facility") and SFS (the "SFS Credit Facility"). Beginning in the first quarter of 2014 and into the third quarter of 2017, the SFS Credit Facility was used to fund a significant portion of client loans. In September 2017, we modified our cash management strategy in order to reduce borrowing costs by applying excess cash balances against revolver credit facility borrowings, and on June 26, 2018, we refinanced our previous credit agreements. Our new credit agreement combined the Agency Credit Facility and SFS Credit Facility into one asset-based revolving credit facility. Subsequent to the refinancing of our previous credit agreements and the resulting elimination of the SFS Credit Facility on June 26, 2018, the SFS loan portfolio is no longer being directly funded with revolving credit facility borrowings. 
(See "Sotheby's Financial Services" under Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for information on the financial performance of SFS for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the SFS loan portfolio.) 
The Art Market
The global art market, like other asset classes, is influenced over time by the overall strength and stability of the global economy, the financial markets of various countries, geopolitical conditions, and world events. However, the global art market often moves independently and sometimes, counter to, general macroeconomic cycles. Ultimately, we believe that the level of activity and buoyancy of the global art market is most prominently impacted by the collective sentiment of art market participants, as well as the individual circumstances of potential sellers of art. For example, many major artworks are offered for sale only as a result of the death or financial or personal situations of the owner (see "Converting Consignment Opportunities" below). In addition, in the wake of economic uncertainty, potential sellers may not be willing to offer their artworks for sale, and potential buyers may be less willing to purchase works of art. Also, in periods of market expansion, potential sellers may choose to not offer their artworks for sale in order to benefit from potential future price appreciation. Taken together, these factors cause the supply and demand for works of art to be unpredictable and may lead to significant variability in our revenues and earnings from period to period.
The most recent Art Basel & UBS Art Market Report estimates that global art sales totaled $64 billion2 in 2017 with private sales by dealers accounting for 53%2 of the market and public auctions accounting for 47%2. This level of global art sales represents a 12%2 increase when compared to 2016, when global art sales totaled $57 billion2, and a compound annual growth rate of 5.5%2 when compared to 2002, when global art sales totaled $27 billion. The growth since 2002 is indicative of the increasingly global nature of the art market, with a rise in cross-border transactions and a more global distribution network, and a significant increase in global wealth, due in part to rising affluence in newly industrialized countries. 
Seasonality
The global art auction market has two principal selling seasons, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. In the aggregate, second and fourth quarter Net Auction Sales3 represented 76%, 80%, and 82% of our total annual Net Auction Sales in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, with auction commission revenues comprising approximately 74%, 66%, and 75% of our total revenues in each of these years. Accordingly, our financial results are seasonal, with peak revenues and operating income generally occurring in the second and fourth quarters. Consequently, first and third quarter results have historically reflected lower revenues when compared to the second and fourth quarters and, typically, a net loss due to the fixed nature of many of our operating expenses. 
In quarterly reporting periods, the comparison of our results between reporting periods can be significantly influenced by a number of factors, such as changes in the timing of when certain auctions occur, the level of non-recurring single-owner auction sale events, the level and timing of individually negotiated private sale transactions, and changes in certain accounting estimates that rely upon forecasted results such as variable incentive and share-based compensation expense and our estimated annual effective income tax rate. Accordingly, when evaluating our performance, we believe that investors should also consider results for rolling six and twelve month periods, which better reflect the business cycle of the global art auction market. (See Note 28 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our quarterly results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.)

Competition
Artworks are sold primarily through the major auction houses, numerous art dealers, smaller auction houses, and also directly between private collectors. In recent years, a growing number of art dealers and private collectors also now buy and sell artworks at art fairs such as the The European Fine Art Fair ("TEFAF"), Art Basel, and the Frieze art fairs. 
Competition in the global art market is intense. A fundamental challenge facing any auctioneer or art dealer is the sourcing of high quality and valuable property for sale either as agent or as principal. Our primary competitor in the global art market is Christie's, a privately owned auction house. To a lesser extent, we also face competition from a variety of art dealers across all collecting categories, as well as smaller auction houses such as Bonhams, Phillips, and certain regional auction houses. In the Chinese art market, the largest auction houses are Beijing Poly International Auction Co. Ltd., China Guardian Auctions Co. Ltd. and Beijing Council International Auction Company Ltd.
In 2018, 2017, and 2016, Sotheby's and Christie's together totaled approximately $11.4 billion, $10.5 billion, and $8.7 billion, respectively, of Aggregate Auction Sales4, of which we accounted for $5.3 billion (46%), $4.6 billion (44%), and $4.2 billion (49%), respectively. 
Converting Consignment Opportunities
The ability to source high quality and valuable property for consignment is highly dependent on the meaningful institutional and personal relationships we have with our clients, which sometimes span generations. As these relationships develop over time, we provide our clients with strategic guidance on collection identity, development and acquisition, and then help them navigate the financial, logistical and personal considerations involved with deciding to sell their valued artworks. A client's decision to sell their art may be part of their long-term financial planning process or could occur suddenly as a result of an unexpected change in circumstances. The timing of when consignment opportunities may arise is often unpredictable and not within our control. As a result, it is difficult to predict with any certainty the supply of high quality and valuable property available for consignment in advance of peak selling seasons.
The more valuable the property, the more likely it is that a seller of art will solicit proposals from more than one potential purchaser or agent. The primary options available to a seller of art are: (i) sale or consignment to an art dealer; (ii) sale or consignment to an auction house; (iii) private sale to a collector or museum; or (iv) consignment to an internet-based service.
A complex array of factors may influence a seller's decision to favor one of these options over the others, and may include any or all of the following considerations:
Factors Influencing a Seller's Decision 
- The level and breadth of expertise of the art dealer or auction house with respect to the property. | - The desirability of a public auction in order to achieve the maximum possible price. 
- The extent of the prior relationship, if any, between the art dealer or auction house and its staff and the seller, and ease of transacting with such parties. | - The amount of cash offered by an art dealer, auction house or other purchaser to purchase the property outright, which is greatly influenced by the amount and cost of capital resources available to such parties. 
- The reputation and historic level of achievement by the art dealer or auction house in attaining high sale prices in the property's specialized category. | - The availability and terms of financial incentives offered by auction houses, including auction guarantees, short-term financing, and auction commission sharing arrangements. 
- Recommendations by third parties consulted by the seller. | - The commission charged by art dealers or auction houses to sell a work on consignment. 
- The client's desire for privacy. | - The cost, style, and extent of pre-sale marketing and promotion to be undertaken by an art dealer or auction house. 
- The level of pre-sale estimates. | - The availability and extent of related services, such as tax or insurance appraisals.

Regulation of the Art Market
Regulation of the art market varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In many jurisdictions, we are subject to laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, import and export regulations, cultural property regulations, data protection and privacy laws, anti-money laundering laws, antitrust laws, copyright and resale royalty laws, laws and regulations involving sales, use, value-added and other indirect taxes, and regulations related to the use of real estate. In addition, we are subject to local auction regulations, such as New York City Auction Regulations Subchapter M of Title 6 §§ 2-121-2-125, et. seq. Such regulations currently do not impose a material impediment to our business, but do affect the art market generally. A material adverse change in such regulations, such as the American Royalties Too Act of 2014 introduced in the U.S. Congress, which would impose a 5% resale royalty (with a cap of $35,000) on sales of art through large auction houses, could affect our business. Additionally, export and import laws and cultural property ownership laws could affect the availability of certain kinds of property for sale at our principal auction locations, increase the cost of moving property to such locations, or expose us to legal claims or government inquiries. We have a Compliance Department which, amongst other activities, develops and updates compliance policies, and audits, monitors, and provides training to our employees on compliance with many of these laws and regulations.
Developing Technology to Attract New Clients and Create Value
We are currently investing in technology to innovate and expand our traditional auction business, as well as to sharpen the differentiation between us and our competitors. The elements of these investments are:

• | Digital Infrastructure—We are developing a new auction engine and enhancing our digital capabilities to enable a paperless auction room. We have also recently installed a new content management system which will provide improved stability, depth, search optimization, and the potential for innovation.


• | Data—We are collating and standardizing our various collections of data, including the Sotheby's Mei Moses Index, our expanded customer relationship management system, object databases, and social media programs. The results of this process will establish the foundation for machine learning and other products that will enhance our ability to serve clients.


• | Basic Digital Services—We have been investing in basic digital services over the past three years. These basic services include a refreshed public website, an upgraded mobile app with payment and bidding capabilities, an upgraded retail wine store, and the acquisition of Viyet, now relaunched as Sotheby's Home, an online marketplace for interior design.


• | Content Marketing—We are continuing to develop a range of rich content to engage current and potential clients. In 2018, we produced and distributed more than 2,000 original pieces, including 373 videos, viewed over 28 million times. More than 15,000 visitors who viewed this content registered to bid in our auctions and a similar number requested estimates for consignments.


• | Advanced Digital Services—We are developing a range of advanced digital services that we believe will serve as a platform for future growth and efficiencies. Such services include our online estimates platform, which went live in 2017, and an improved appraisal interface, which is expected to launch in 2019.

An important measure of the effectiveness of our technology investments is the level of online sales. For the purposes of this discussion, the term "online sales" represents the aggregate sale price of lots purchased through online bids at our live auctions and in our online-only auctions, as well as items purchased through our retail websites, Sotheby’s Home and Sotheby's Wine. In 2018, online sales increased 24% to $220.4 million and include $72.1 million of sales attributable to online-only auctions and sales through Sotheby’s Home and Sotheby's Wine, as compared to $18.9 million in the prior year. Online sales are an important source of client growth and opportunity, with 60% of first-time bidders at Sotheby's coming through digital channels. 
While our technology investments are facilitating the innovation and expansion of our traditional business, these investments have contributed to an overall increase in operating expenses across various categories in recent years, including in 2018.

Brand Licensing Activities
Prior to 2004, we were engaged in the marketing and brokerage of luxury residential real estate sales through Sotheby's International Realty ("SIR"). In 2004, we sold SIR to a subsidiary of Realogy Corporation ("Realogy"), formerly Cendant Corporation. In conjunction with the sale, we entered into an agreement with Realogy to license the SIR trademark and certain related trademarks for an initial 50-year term with a 50-year renewal option (the "Realogy License Agreement"). The Realogy License Agreement is applicable worldwide. The Realogy License Agreement provides for an ongoing license fee during its term based on the volume of commerce transacted under the licensed trademarks. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, we earned $10.9 million, $10.3 million, and $9.1 million, respectively, in license fee revenue related to the Realogy License Agreement.
We also license the Sotheby's name for use in connection with the art auction business in Australia, and art education services in the U.S. and the U.K. We will consider additional opportunities to license the Sotheby's brand in businesses where appropriate.
