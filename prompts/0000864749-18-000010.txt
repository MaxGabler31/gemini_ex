Competition 
Our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future. Within our markets, we encounter direct competition from other GNSS, software, optical, and laser suppliers such as Hexagon and Topcon, and competition may intensify from various larger U.S. and non-U.S. competitors. Our hardware products are increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants from emerging markets such as China, which compete aggressively on price at the lower-priced end of the market. Our integrated hardware and software products may also be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets combined with relatively inexpensive applications, which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past. 
Many of our products and solutions are focused on specific industries. In each of these industries, we face competition from companies providing point solutions or more traditional, less technology intensive products and services, and these companies often have greater financial resources and more established and recognized brands in those industries. Competing in vertical markets with more established industry participants requires that we successfully establish a market position and market new and sometimes unfamiliar technology and automated solutions to customers that have not previously used such products. We also increasingly offer enterprise level solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our target industries. In doing so, we face competition from larger and more well established providers of enterprise software and services with whom we have not previously competed. See also "Risk Factors - We face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition."
Sales and Marketing

In addition to direct sales, many of our products are sold worldwide primarily through indirect channels, including distributors, dealers, and authorized representatives. Occasionally we grant exclusive rights to market certain products, or within specific countries. These channels are supported by our regional sales offices throughout the world. We also utilize distribution alliances, OEM relationships, and joint ventures with other companies as a means to serve selected markets, as well as direct sales to end-users.
During fiscal 2017, sales to customers in the United States represented 48%, Europe represented 26%, Asia Pacific represented 14%, and other regions represented 12% of our total revenue. 
Seasonality of Business 
Construction equipment revenues, within our Buildings and Infrastructure segment, historically have been higher in early spring. Our agricultural equipment revenues, within our Resources and Utilities segment, have historically been the highest in the first quarter, followed by the second quarter, reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the Northern hemisphere. However, overall as a company, as a result of diversification of our business across segments and the increased impact of subscription revenues, we may experience less seasonality in the future. Changes in global macroeconomic conditions could also impact the level of seasonality we experience.
Manufacturing
We outsource the manufacturing of many of our hardware products to our key contract manufacturing partners that include Flex Ltd., Benchmark Electronics Inc., and Jabil. Our contract manufacturing partners are responsible for significant material procurement, assembly, and testing. We continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products, and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products. Our current contract with Flex Ltd. continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice. We also utilize original design manufacturers for some of our products.
We manufacture our laser and optics-based products, as well as some of our GPS products, at our plants in Dayton, Ohio; Danderyd, Sweden, and Shanghai, China. Some of these products or portions of these products are also subcontracted to third parties for assembly.
Our design, manufacturing, and distribution sites in Dayton, Ohio; Sunnyvale, California; Danderyd, Sweden; Eersel, Netherlands; Auckland, New Zealand​, and Shanghai, China are registered to ISO9001:20​15, covering the design, production, distribution, and servicing of all our products.
