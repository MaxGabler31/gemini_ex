Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We are a medical device company focusing on the development and commercialization of our proprietary MicroNet™ stent platform technology for the treatment of complex vascular and coronary disease. A stent is an expandable “scaffold-like” device, usually constructed of a metallic material, that is inserted into an artery to expand the inside passage and improve blood flow. MicroNet, a micron mesh sleeve, is wrapped over a stent to provide embolic protection in stenting procedures.
 
Our CGuard™ carotid embolic prevention system (“CGuard EPS”) combines MicroNet and a self-expandable nitinol stent in a single device for use in carotid artery applications. Our CGuard EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in March 2013 and was fully launched in Europe in September 2015. Subsequently, we launched CGuard EPS in Russia and certain countries in Latin America and Asia, including India. In September 2020, we launched CGuard EPS in Brazil after receiving regulatory approval in July 2020 and as discussed below, on February 3, 2021, we executed a distribution agreement with Chinese partners for the purpose of expanding our presence in China. Currently, we are seeking strategic partners for a potential launch of CGuard EPS in Japan and other Asian countries.


On September 8, 2020, we received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) of our Investigation Device Exemption (“IDE”), thereby allowing us to proceed with a pivotal study of our CGuard™ Carotid Stent System, C-Guardians, for prevention of stroke in patients in the United States. C-Guardians is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, pivotal study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CGuard™ Carotid Stent System when used to treat symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in patients undergoing carotid artery stenting. The trial was designed to enroll approximately 315 subjects in a maximum of 40 study sites located in the United States and Europe. Study sites in Europe may contribute a maximum of approximately 50% of the total enrollees. The primary endpoint of the study will be the composite of incidence of death (all-cause mortality), all stroke, and myocardial infarction (DSMI) through 30-days post-index procedure, based on the clinical events committee (CEC) adjudication and ipsilateral stroke from 31-365 day follow-up, based on Clinical Events Committee (CEC) adjudication.
 
On July 23, 2021, we announced the initiation of enrollment and successful completion of the first cases of our C-Guardian trial of CGuard EPS. The first patients, who were under the care of principal investigator, Chris Metzger, M.D., system chair of clinical research at Ballard Health System in Eastern Tennessee, were successfully implanted with the CGuard EPS stent device. These are the first of 315 patients who are expected to be enrolled in the trial and receive CGuard EPS in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients undergoing carotid artery stenting. We are currently continuing with the enrollment phase.
 
Additionally, we intend to continue to invest in current and future potential product and manufacturing enhancements for CGuard EPS that are expected to reduce cost of goods and/or provide the best-in-class performing delivery system. In furtherance of our strategy that focuses on establishing CGuard EPS as a viable alternative to vascular surgery, we are exploring adding new delivery systems and accessory solutions for procedural protection to our portfolio.
 
We consider the current addressable market for our CGuard EPS to be individuals with diagnosed, symptomatic high-grade carotid artery stenosis (HGCS, ≥70% occlusion) for whom intervention is preferable to medical (drug) therapy. This group includes not only carotid artery stenting patients but also individuals undergoing carotid endarterectomy, as the two approaches compete for the same patient population. Assuming full penetration of the intervention caseload by CGuard EPS, we estimate that the addressable market for CGuard EPS will be approximately $666 million in 2022 (source: Health Research International Personal Medical Systems, Inc. September 13, 2021 Results of Update Report on Global Carotid Stenting Procedures and Markets by Major Geography and Addressable Markets). According to this same report, assuming full penetration of the caseload for all individuals diagnosed with high-grade carotid artery stenosis, we estimate that the total available market for CGuard EPS in 2022 will be approximately $5 billion.

Our MGuard™ Prime™ embolic protection system (“MGuard Prime EPS”) is marketed for use in patients with acute coronary syndromes, notably acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and saphenous vein graft coronary interventions, or bypass surgery. MGuard Prime EPS combines MicroNet with a bare-metal cobalt-chromium based stent. MGuard Prime EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in October 2010 for improving luminal diameter and providing embolic protection. Over the past years there has been a shift in industry preferences away from bare-metal stents, such as MGuard Prime EPS in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (“STEMI”) patients. As a result of declining sales of the MGuard Prime EPS, which we believe this is largely driven by the predominant industry preferences favoring drug-eluting, or drug-coated, stents, we intend to phase out future sales of our MGuard Prime EPS in 2022.
 
We also intend to develop a pipeline of other products and indications by leveraging our MicroNet technology to improve peripheral procedures such as the treatment of the superficial femoral artery disease and vascular disease below the knee as well as neurovascular procedures, such as the treatment of acute stroke.
 
Presently, none of our products may be sold or marketed in the United States, but we do derive revenues from the use of our products in the currently ongoing trials.
 
We were organized in the State of Delaware on February 29, 2008.

Public Offerings
 
On February 8, 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of 1,935,484 units, with each such unit being comprised of one share of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and one Series G Warrant to purchase one-half of one share of common stock (the “February 2021 Offering”). The offering price to the public was $9.30 per unit. The Series G Warrants were immediately exercisable at a price of $10.23 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, and expire five years from the date of issuance. We also granted the underwriter of the offering an option to purchase an additional 290,322 shares of common stock and Series G Warrants to purchase 145,161 shares of common stock, which the underwriter exercised in full. In connection with the offering we granted to the underwriter a compensation warrant to purchase up to 111,290 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $10.23 per share and which are exercisable for five years from February 3, 2021. Our net proceeds from the offering, after giving effect to the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option, were approximately $18.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and payment of other expenses associated with the offering, but excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of Series G Warrants sold in the offering.
Distribution and Purchase Agreement with Chinese Partners
 
On February 3, 2021, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with three China-based partners, pursuant to which the Chinese partners will be responsible for conducting the necessary registration trials for commercial approval of our products in China, followed by an eight-year exclusive distribution right to sell our products in China with the term of the agreement continuing on a year-to-year basis unless terminated. Under the Distribution Agreement, the China-based partners will be subject to minimum purchase obligations. The Distribution Agreement may be terminated for cause upon failure to meet minimum purchase obligations, failure to obtain regulatory approvals or for other material breaches.
 
In addition, and on the same day, we entered into an investment transaction with QIDI, which included (i) an SPA, pursuant to which QIDI agreed to invest $900,000 in exchange for shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $10.062 per share, and (ii) an IRA, whereby QIDI was provided certain customary registration rights, including a commitment by us to file a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-1 or Form S-3 and have such registration statement become effective not later than 150 days following the closing of the transactions under the SPA.

ATM Offering
 
On July 28, 2020, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Alliance Global Partners (“A.G.P.”) pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, at our option, through or to A.G.P., up to an aggregate of approximately $9,300,000 of shares of common stock (the “ATM Facility”). Any shares to be offered and sold under the Sales Agreement will be issued and sold pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-223130), filed with the SEC on February 21, 2018 and the prospectus supplement thereto filed with the SEC on July 28, 2020, by methods deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or if specified by us, by any other method permitted by law. On January 11, 2021, we increased the aggregate amount of our shares of common stock that may be sold under the Sales Agreement from $9,300,000 to $10,382,954, and, as a result, utilized and sold the maximum amount allowable under the ATM Facility, which resulted in an aggregate amount of $10,381,958.
 
Reverse Stock Split
 
On April 14, 2021, our stockholders approved a reverse stock split of our common stock, following which, and on the same date, our board of directors approved a ratio of 1-for-15 for the reverse stock split, or the Reverse Stock Split. On April 14, 2021, the Delaware Secretary of State approved our Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which set an effective date of April 26, 2021, for the Reverse Stock Split. The post-Reverse Stock Split CUSIP number for our common stock is 45779A 846.
 
On the April 26, 2021, the total number of shares of our common stock held by each stockholder was converted automatically into the number of whole shares of common stock equal to (i) the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock held by such stockholder immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split, divided by (ii) 15.
 
No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and no cash or other consideration was be paid. Instead, we issued one whole share of the post-Reverse Stock Split common stock to any shareholder who otherwise would have received a fractional share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.
 
Appointment of Kathryn Arnold to our Board of Directors
 
On May 10, 2021, the board of directors appointed Ms. Kathryn Arnold as a Class III member of the Board, effective as of that date, with a term expiring at the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. In connection with her appointment, on May 10, 2021, Ms. Arnold was granted (a) options to purchase 3,512 shares of Common Stock (the “Options”), and (b) 10,536 shares of restricted stock (the “Restricted Stock”, together with the Options the “Arnold Grant”). The Options have an exercise price equal to the closing fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant, subject to the terms and conditions of the Company’s 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The Options and the Restricted Stock will vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments beginning on the one-year anniversary of the date of the Arnold Grant, provided that in the event that Ms. Arnold is either (i) not reelected as a director at the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, or (ii) not nominated for reelection as a director at the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, any unvested Options or Restricted Stock will vest in full and become exercisable on the date of the decision not to reelect or nominate her (as applicable). The Options have a term of 10 years from the date of grant.

Nasdaq Listing
 
On May 10, 2021, we announced that our shares that previously traded on the NYSE American were approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) and such shares began trading on Nasdaq on May 21, 2021 under the symbol, “NSPR.” On May 27, 2021, we announced that our warrants that previously traded on the NYSE American were approved for listing on Nasdaq, and such warrants began trading on June 8, 2021. On July 7, 2021, our Series A warrants that previously traded under symbol “NSPRW” expired.
National Commission for the Evaluation of Medical Devices and Health Technologies
 
On October 13, 2021, we announced that our CGuard EPS stent system received a positive opinion from the National Commission for the Evaluation of Medical Devices and Health Technologies (CNEDIMTS) of the French National Authority for Health (HAS) regarding reimbursement in France, and the CGuard EPS was being added to the list of reimbursed medical products (LPPR) effective October 25, 2021. This was the final step to full commercial launch of CGuard EPS following CNEDIMTS’ positive opinion for reimbursement received by the Company on May 11, 2021 for the treatment of symptomatic and non-symptomatic lesions when surgery is not indicated.
COVID-19 Developments
 
The COVID-19 global pandemic has led governments and authorities around the globe to take various precautionary measures in order to limit the spread of COVID-19, including government-imposed quarantines, lockdowns, and other public health safety measures. We experienced a significant COVID-19 related impact on our financial condition and results of operations, primarily during the year ended December 31, 2020, which we primarily attribute to the postponement of CGuard EPS procedures (non-emergency procedures), as hospitals have shifted resources to patients affected by COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, there are European countries in which we operate reinstated non-emergency procedures. However, new COVID-19 variants, and potentially increasing infection rates make the current COVID-related environment highly volatile and uncertain and we anticipate that the continuation of the pandemic and related restrictions and safety measures will likely result in continued fluctuations in sales of our products, potentially enrollments in our studies as well as potential disruptions to our supply chain for the upcoming periods.
Our Industry
 
Carotid
 
Carotid arteries are located on each side of the neck and provide the primary blood supply to the brain. Carotid artery disease, also called carotid artery stenosis, is a type of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) that is one of the major risk factors for ischemic stroke. In carotid artery disease, plaque accumulates in the artery walls, narrowing the artery and disrupting the blood supply to the brain. This disruption in blood supply, together with plaque debris breaking off the artery walls and traveling to the brain, are the primary causes of stroke. According to the World Health Organization (https://www.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/resources/atlas/en/) every year, 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke, and nearly six million die and another five million are left permanently disabled. According to the same source, stroke is the second leading cause of disability, after dementia.
 
In 2021, 2.8 million people between the age of 50 and 89 years old were estimated to be diagnosed with high grade carotid artery disease, of which, approximately 380,000 of those diagnosed required intervention for carotid artery disease (according to the Health Research International Personal Medical Systems, Inc. September 13, 2021 Results of Update Report on Global Carotid Stenting Procedures and Markets by Major Geography and Addressable Markets). There are two current intervention treatments used for carotid artery disease. The first is a carotid endarterectomy where a surgeon accesses the blocked carotid artery though an incision in the neck, and then surgically removes the plaque. The second is carotid artery stenting, which is a minimally invasive endovascular treatment for carotid artery disease and an alternative to carotid endarterectomy. Endovascular techniques using stents and carotid embolic prevention system protect against plaque and debris traveling downstream, blocking off the vessel and disrupting blood flow. We believe that the use of a stent with an embolic protection system should increase the number of patients being treated since it would avoid the need for complex surgery.

Peripheral
 
Peripheral vascular diseases (“PVD”) are caused by the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in arteries, which carry blood to organs, limbs and head. It is also known as peripheral artery occlusive disease or peripheral artery disease. It comprises diseases pertaining to both peripheral veins and peripheral arteries, affecting the peripheral and cardiac circulation in the body. PVD includes diseases outside of the heart and brain, but most times refers to the leg and foot.
 
Peripheral stents are more often used in combination with balloon angioplasty to open the veins, so that blood can flow through the blocked veins in the body.
 
The growing prevalence of PVD is expected to cause increased demand for treatment options. PVD is age related and its prevalence increases markedly with advancing age. In addition, PVD is more prevalent in lower and medium income countries than in higher income countries (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(19)30255-4)
 
Our Products
 
Below is a summary of our current products and products under development, and their intended applications.
 
MicroNet
 
MicroNet is our proprietary circular knitted mesh which wraps around a stent to protect patients from plaque debris flowing downstream upon deployment. MicroNet is made of a single fiber from a biocompatible polymer widely used in medical implantations. The size, or aperture, of the current MicroNet ‘pore’ is only 150-180 microns in order to maximize protection against the potentially dangerous plaque and thrombus.
CGuard – Carotid Applications
 
Our CGuard EPS combines our MicroNet mesh and a self-expandable nitinol stent (a stent that expands without balloon dilation pressure or need of an inflation balloon) in a single device for use in carotid artery applications. MicroNet is placed over and attached to an open cell nitinol metal stent platform which is designed to trap debris and emboli that can dislodge from the diseased carotid artery and potentially travel to the brain and cause a stroke. This danger is one of the greatest limitations of carotid artery stenting with conventional carotid stents and stenting methods. The CGuard EPS technology is a highly flexible stent system that conforms to the carotid anatomy.
 
We believe that our CGuard EPS design provides advantages over existing therapies in treating carotid artery stenosis, such as conventional carotid stenting and surgical endarterectomy, given the superior embolic protection characteristics provided by the MicroNet. We believe the MicroNet will provide acute embolic protection at the time of the procedure, but more importantly, we believe that CGuard EPS will provide post-procedure protection against embolic dislodgement, which can occur up to 48 hours post-procedure. It is in this post-procedure time frame that embolization is the source of post-procedural strokes in the brain. Schofer, et al. (“Late cerebral embolization after emboli-protected carotid artery stenting assessed by sequential diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging,” Journal of American College of Cardiology Cardiovascular Interventions, Volume 1, 2008) have shown that the majority of the incidents of embolic showers associated with carotid stenting occur post-procedure.

Our CGuard™ carotid embolic prevention system (“CGuard EPS”) combines MicroNet and a self-expandable nitinol stent in a single device for use in carotid artery applications. Our CGuard EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in March 2013 and was fully launched in Europe in September 2015. Subsequently, we launched CGuard EPS in Russia and certain countries in Latin America and Asia, including India. In September 2020, we launched CGuard EPS in Brazil after receiving regulatory approval in July 2020 and on February 3, 2021, we executed a distribution agreement with Chinese partners for the purpose of expanding our presence in China. On October 13, 2021, we announced that our CGuard EPS stent system received a positive opinion regarding reimbursement in France. Currently, we are seeking strategic partners for a potential launch of CGuard EPS in Japan.
 
On September 8, 2020, we received approval from the FDA of our IDE, thereby allowing us to proceed with a pivotal study of our CGuard™ Carotid Stent System, C-Guardians, for prevention of stroke in patients in the United States. C-Guardians is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, pivotal study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CGuard™ Carotid Stent System when used to treat symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in patients undergoing carotid artery stenting. The trial was designed to enroll approximately 315 subjects in a maximum of 40 study sites located in the United States and Europe. Study sites in Europe may contribute a maximum of approximately 50% of the total enrollees. The primary endpoint of the study will be the composite of incidence of death (all-cause mortality), all stroke, and myocardial infarction (DSMI) through 30-days post-index procedure, based on the clinical events committee (CEC) adjudication and ipsilateral stroke from 31-365 day follow-up, based on Clinical Events Committee (CEC) adjudication.
 
On July 23, 2021, we announced the initiation of enrollment and successful completion of the first cases of our C-Guardian trial of CGuard EPS. The first patients, who were under the care of principal investigator, Chris Metzger, M.D., system chair of clinical research at Ballard Health System in Eastern Tennessee, were successfully implanted with the CGuard EPS stent device. These are the first of 315 patients who are expected to be enrolled in the trial and receive CGuard EPS in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients undergoing carotid artery stenting. We are currently continuing with the enrollment phase. Additionally, we intend to continue to invest in current and future potential product and manufacturing enhancements for CGuard EPS that are expected to reduce cost of goods and/or provide the best-in-class performing delivery system. In furtherance of our strategy that focuses on establishing CGuard EPS as a viable alternative to vascular surgery, we are exploring adding new delivery systems and accessory solutions for procedural protection to our portfolio.
 
MGuard Products– Coronary Applications
 
Bare-Metal Stent MGuard Product. Our MGuard Prime EPS coronary product is comprised of MicroNet wrapped around a cobalt-chromium based bare-metal stent. In comparison to a conventional bare-metal stent, we believe our MGuard Prime EPS coronary product with MicroNet mesh provides protection from dangerous embolic showers in patients experiencing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, the most severe form of a heart attack, referred to as STEMI. Standard stents were not engineered for heart attack patients. Rather, they were designed for treating stable angina patients whose occlusion is different from that of an occlusion in a heart attack patient. In acute heart attack patients, the plaque or thrombus is unstable and often breaks up as the stent is implanted causing downstream blockages in a significant portion of heart attack patients. Our MGuard Prime EPS is integrated with a precisely engineered micro net mesh that is designed to prevent the unstable arterial plaque and thrombus that caused the heart attack blockage from breaking off. Over the past years there has been a shift in industry preferences away from bare-metal stents, such as MGuard Prime EPS in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction STEMI patients. As a result of declining sales of the MGuard Prime EPS, which we believe this is largely driven by the predominant industry preferences favoring drug-eluting, or drug-coated, stents, we intend to phase out future sales of our MGuard Prime EPS in 2022.

PVGuard — Peripheral Vascular Applications
 
We intend to develop our MicroNet mesh sleeve and a self-expandable stent for use in peripheral vascular applications, to which we refer to as PVGuard. PVDs are usually characterized by the accumulation of plaque in arteries in the legs. This accumulation can lead to the need for amputation or even death, when untreated. PVD is treated either by trying to clear the artery of the blockage, or by implanting a stent in the affected area to push the blockage out of the way of normal blood flow.
 
As in carotid procedures, peripheral procedures are characterized by the necessity of controlling embolic showers both during and post-procedure. Controlling embolic showers is so important in these indications that physicians often use fully covered stents, at the risk of blocking branching vessels, to ensure that emboli do not fall into the bloodstream and move to the brain. We believe that our MicroNet design will provide substantial advantages over existing therapies in treating peripheral artery stenosis.
 
However, as we plan to focus our resources on the further expansion of our sales and marketing activities for CGuard EPS and potential product enhancements and manufacturing enhancements for CGuard EPS expected to reduce cost of goods and/or provide the best-in-class performing delivery system and its submission for CE mark approval, we do not intend to pursue the development of PVGuard in the near future.
 
Completed Clinical Trials for CGuard EPS
 
CARENET
 
The CARENET trial was the first multi-center study of CGuard EPS following the receipt of CE mark of this device in March 2013. The CARENET trial was designed to evaluate feasibility and safety of CGuard EPS in treatment of carotid lesions in consecutive patients suitable for coronary artery stenting (“CAS”) in a multi-operator, real-life setting. The acute, 30 day, magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”), ultrasound and six month clinical event results were presented at the LINC conference in Leipzig, Germany in February, 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, the results of the CGuard CARENET trial were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. In November 2015, positive twelve month follow-up data from the CGuard CARENET trial was presented at the 42nd Annual Symposium on Vascular and Endovascular Issues, documenting the benefits of the CGuard MicroNet technology as well as the patency benefits (maintaining the artery open) of the internal and external carotid arteries at twelve months.
 
MACCE (myocardial infarction (“MI”), stroke or death) rate was 0.0% at 30 days. At six months, there was one death, which was not device or procedure-related but did result in a MACCE rate of 3.6% at six months. At twelve months there were two additional deaths, which were not device or procedure-related resulting in a MACCE rate of 10.7% at one year.
 

 | 30 days (n=30) | | 6 months (n=28) | | 12 months (n=28) | 
------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+---+-------------------------------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------------------------------+--
MACCE (MI, stroke, death) | (0) 0.0 | % | (1) 3.6 | % | (3) 10.7 | %

CAS carries the risk of cerebral embolization during and following the procedure, leading to life-threatening complications, mainly cerebral ischemic events. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a sensitive tool used to identify cerebral emboli during CAS by measuring “lesions” within the brain which are areas that are ischemic and do not receive oxygenated blood due to cerebral emboli. In the CARENET trial, 37.0% of patients treated with CGuard EPS had new ischemic lesions at 48 hours after the procedure, with an average volume of 0.039 cm3. Of these lesions, there was only one that remained at 30 days following the procedure and all others had resolved. Complete details appear in the following table. Where there is a second number shown below after a ± symbol, it indicates the potential error in the measurement.

The healing process of the tissue and in-stent restenosis can be measured by a non-invasive form of ultrasound called duplex ultrasound. This type of ultrasound measures the velocity of the blood that flows within the carotid arteries, which increases exponentially as the lumen of the internal carotid artery narrows and the percent stenosis increases. One of the measurements is called PSV (peak systolic volume) and is known to be highly correlated to the degree of in-stent restenosis; PSV values higher than 300 cm/sec are indicative of >70% stenosis, while PSV values lower than 104 cm/sec are indicative of <30% restenosis and healthy healing. In the CARENET trial, duplex ultrasound measurements done at 30 days, 6 months and 12 months following the stenting procedure all attest to healthy normal healing without restenosis concerns, as the PSV values were 60.96 cm/sec ± 22.31, 85.24 cm/sec ± 39.56, and 90.22 cm/sec ± 37.72 respectively. The internal carotid artery was patent in all patients (100%).
 
The conclusions of the CARENET trial were:
 

● | The CARENET trial demonstrated safety of the CGuard EPS stent, with a 30 day MACCE rate of 0%. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Incidence of new ipsilateral lesions (percent of patients with new lesions on the ipsilateral side (same side where the stent was employed)) at 48 hours was reduced by almost half compared to published data, and volume was reduced almost tenfold. 
● | All but one lesion had resolved completely by 30 days. 
● | Twelve month data showed no stroke or stroke-related deaths, and no cardiac adverse events. 
● | CGuard EPS offers enhanced benefits for patients undergoing CAS with unprecedented safety. 

 
Physician-Sponsored Clinical Trials for CGuard—PARADIGM-101 Study
 
PARADIGM-101 (Prospective evaluation of All-comer peRcutaneous cArotiD revascularization In symptomatic and increased-risk asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, using CGuard™ Mesh-covered embolic prevention stent system-101) was an investigator-led, single center study with the objective of evaluating feasibility and outcome of routine use of CGuard EPS in 101 consecutive unselected all-comer patients referred for carotid revascularization, initiated in 2015. In May 2016, the 30-day results were presented at the EuroPCR 2016 Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Session in Paris, and in the Journal of EuroIntervention.
 
Key findings from the PARADIGM-101 study and the follow-up data are as follows:
 

● | CGuard EPS delivery success was 99.1%. The clinical evaluation also found no device foreshortening or elongation; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Angiographic diameter stenosis or vessel narrowing was reduced from 83±9% to only 6.7±5% (p<0.001); 
● | Periprocedural death/major stroke/ myocardial infarction (“MI”) rates were 0%; 
● | One event was adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee as a minor stroke (0.9%), with no change in NIH Stroke Scale or modified Ranking scale; 

 
The results of the PARADIGM-101 study demonstrated that CGuard EPS can safely be used in a high risk, all-comer population of patients with carotid artery stenosis and indicated that routine use of CGuard EPS may prevent cerebral events, such as strokes, by holding plaque against the vessel wall, preventing emboli from being released into the blood stream. The PARADIGM-101 study found that CGuard EPS is applicable in up to 90% of all-comer patients with carotid stenosis.

Clinical Results and Mechanical Properties of the Carotid CGUARD Double-Layered Embolic Prevention Stent Study
 
“Clinical Results and Mechanical Properties of the Carotid CGUARD Double-Layered Embolic Prevention Stent Study” was an investigator-led, prospective single-center study which evaluated CGuard EPS in 30 consecutive patients with internal carotid artery stenosis disease with the objective of reporting early clinical outcomes with a novel MicroNet covered stent for the internal carotid artery and the in vitro investigation of the device’s mechanical properties. In October 2016, the 30-day positive results were published online-ahead-of-print in the Journal of Endovascular Therapy.
 
Key findings from the study are as follows:
 

● | 100% success in implanting CGuard EPS without residual stenosis; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | No peri- or post-procedural complications; 
● | No deaths, major adverse events, minor or major strokes, or new neurologic symptoms during the six months following the procedure; 
● | Modified Rankin Scale improved for the symptomatic patients from 1.56 prior to the procedure to 0 afterwards; 
● | All vessels treated with CGuard EPS remained patent (open) at six months; and 
● | DW-MRI performed in 19 of 30 patients found no new ipsilateral lesions after 30 days and after six months compared with the baseline DW-MRI studies. 

 
Additionally, based on engineering evaluations, the study concluded that CGuard EPS provides a high radial force and strong support in stenotic lesions. The stent is easy to use and safe to implant because it does not foreshorten and its structure adapts well to changes in diameter and direction of tortuous vascular anatomies. The MicroNet mesh of CGuard did not cause any changes to specific mechanical parameters of the underlying stent.
 
CGUARD Mesh-Covered Stent in Real World: The IRON-Guard Registry
 
“CGUARD Mesh-Covered Stent in Real World: The IRON-Guard Registry using CGuard EPS” was a physician initiated prospective multi-center registry that included 200 patients from 12 medical centers in Italy. The objective of the study was to report 30-day outcomes (including MACCE) in a prospective series of patients who were treated with CGuard EPS between April 2015 and June 2016. In January 2017, 30-day results were presented at the Leipzig Interventional Course (LINC) 2017 and published in the Journal of EuroIntervention in May 2017. The 12 month follow-up was published in the Journal of EuroIntevention in October 2018.
 
Key 30-day results presented were:
 

● | 100% success in implanting CGuard EPS; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | No MI, major stroke or death at 30 days; 
● | There were two transient ischemic attacks and five periprocedural minor strokes, including one thrombosis solved by surgery. 
● | Total elimination of post-procedural neurologic complications by 30 days; 
● | DW-MRI performed pre-procedure and between 24 and 72 hours post-procedure in 61 patients, indicated that 12 patients had new micro emboli (19%). 
● | At 12 months, there were no new major neurological adverse events, thrombosis or external carotid occlusion recorded; 
● | One myocardial infarction occurred at 12 months.

Peri-procedural brain lesions prevention in CAS (3PCAS): Randomized trial comparing CGuard stent vs. WallStent™ Study
 
3PCAS study was an independent investigator-led single center randomized clinical trial, comparing CGuard EPS vs. WallStent™, intended to evaluate the incidence of peri-procedural diffusion-weighted-magnetic-resonance-imaging (DW-MRI) new brain lesions after carotid artery stenting. Sixty-one consecutive patients referred for carotid revascularization (between January 2015 and October 2016) were eligible for the study. The results of the 3PCAS study was published in the International Journal of Cardiology in September 2018. The discussion distinguished between peri-procedural (from procedure to 48h -72h) and post-procedural periods (72h to 30 days) where the CGuard EPS demonstrated a reduction in the post-procedural embolic effect during the carotid plaque healing period. In contrast, there was no difference between the two stent groups during the peri-procedural stage because of, according to the published article, the presence of bilateral/contralateral lesions (lesions resulting from the contralateral artery from the non-treated carotid) which suggest that the peri-procedural neurological damage may have originated from extra-carotid sources (outside of the artery which was treated and outside the stent itself).
 
Initial Clinical Study of the New CGuard EPS MicroNet Covered Carotid Stent: “One Size Fits All”
 
“Initial Clinical Study of the New CGuard EPS MicroNet Covered Carotid Stent: ‘One Size Fits All’” was an investigator-led, single-center study, which evaluated CGuard EPS in 30 consecutive patients with symptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery with the objective of evaluating the CGuard EPS MicroNet covered stent for its ability to adjust to different vessel diameters. The results of the study were published in the Journal of Endovascular Therapy in May 2019. The conclusion of the study as reported was that CGuard EPS has high conformability combined with an almost equivalent outward radial force at expansion diameters ranging from 5.5 to 9.0 mm. The first clinical results demonstrate the “One Size Fits All” stent can be implanted in internal carotid arteries with reference diameters within this range.
 
Key findings from the study were as follows:
 

● | 100% technical success in implanting CGuard EPS; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | No neurological events within 30 days; 
● | The chronic outward force normalized by stent length demonstrated a near-equivalent radial force outcome; and 
● | The stent displayed only a minor difference between the minimal radial force at 9.0 mm (0.195 N/mm) and the maximal radial force at 5.5 mm (0.330 N/mm). 

Preliminary Results from a Prospective Real-World Multicenter Clinical Practice of Carotid Artery Stenting Using the CGuard Embolic Prevention System: The IRONGUARD 2 Study
 
“Preliminary Results From a Prospective Real-World Multicenter Clinical Practice of Carotid Artery Stenting Using the CGuard Embolic Prevention System: The IRONGUARD 2 Study” is a physician initiated prospective multi-center registry enrolling 733 patients from 20 medical centers in Italy, from January 2017 to June 2019. The objective of the study is to evaluate periprocedural (24 hours), post-procedural (up to 30 days), and 12-month outcomes in a largest, prospective, multicenter series of patients submitted for protected carotid artery stenting with the CGuard Embolic Prevention System. The 24-hour, 30-day and 12-month preliminary results (data available on 726 patients out of the 733 treated) were presented at the Leipzig Interventional Course (LINC) in January 2021. The study’s preliminary results from the IRONGUAURD 2 study suggested in a real-world evaluation of carotid artery stenting, Cguard EPS can be safely used for treatment of extracranial carotid artery stenosis, allowing a low rate of post procedural adverse events by 12 months.
 
Key findings from the study are as follows:
 

● | 100%% procedural success in implanting CGuard EPS; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 1 death from hemorrhagic stroke (patient was admitted for immediate treatment of CAS due to stroke), 2 minor strokes, 6 TIAs and one nonfatal AMI at 24 hours; 
● | 1 minor stroke, 2 TIAs, three AMIs, no deaths and no stent thrombosis/occlusions between 24 hours and 30 days; and 
● | 1 minor stroke, 4 TIAs, 2 AMIs and 8 deaths (the 2 mentioned AMIs, 4 malignancies, 1 suicide and 1 undefined complication in Guillain-Barré Syndrome) between 30 days and 1 year.

The SIBERIA Trial for Carotid Artery Stenosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Conventional Versus Micronet™-Covered Stent Use in Percutaneous Neuroprotected Carotid Artery Revascularization: Peri-procedural and 30-day Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Clinical Outcomes
 
“The SIBERIA Trial for Carotid Artery Stenosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Conventional Versus Micronet™-Covered Stent Use in Percutaneous Neuroprotected Carotid Artery Revascularization: Peri-procedural and 30-day Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Clinical Outcomes” was an investigator-initiated randomized clinical trial, single-center study, which evaluated one hundred patients who qualified for carotid revascularization with high risk for surgery and were randomized 1:1 to either CGuard EPS or AcculinkTM. The primary endpoints were incidence and volume of new cerebral embolic post-procedural lesions (24-48 hours) as determined by diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). The principal secondary endpoints included incidence of periprocedural or postprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction and death at 30 days. The results of the study were presented in a late-breaking session at the EuroPCR in June 2020 and published (Randomized Controlled Trial of Conventional Versus MicroNet-Covered Stent in Carotid Artery Revascularization, JACC Cardiovascular Interventions, Vol. 14, November 21, 2021). The conclusion of the study was that the CGuard™ Micronet™-covered stent use in consecutive unselected patients subjected to neuroprotected carotid artery stenting was associated with a greater than three-fold reduction in the procedure-generated mean cerebral lesion volume, and with zero post-procedural cerebral embolisms observed. The MicroNet covered stent significantly reduced periprocedural and abolished post procedural cerebral embolism in relation to a conventional carotid stent. This is consistent with the MicroNet covered stent’s sustained embolism prevention, translating into cerebral protection not only during but after carotid artery stenting.
 
Key findings from the study are as follows:
 

● | Peri Procedure, the CGuard™ arm was observed to have a 57% reduction in new cerebral lesion average volume per patient (171 mm3 vs. 73 mm3), a statistically significant improvement (p=0.017) and 222 mm3 vs. 84 mm3 (p=0.038); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Post Procedure (24-48 hours), the CGuard™ arm was observed to have a 78% reduction in the average volume of new cerebral lesions (157 mm3 vs. 700 mm3), a statistically significant improvement (p=0.007); 
● | At 30 days, DW-MRI showed zero new cerebral lessons in the CGuard™ arm versus six in the Acculink™ arm (p=0.03); 
● | At 30 days, there were zero strokes, myocardia infarctions or deaths in the CGuard arm and three events the Acculink™ arm (two strokes and one myocardial infarction). 

Completed Clinical Trials for MGuard Bare-Metal Coronary Products
 
We have completed eight clinical trials with respect to our first generation stainless steel-based MGuard coronary device and our cobalt-chromium based MGuard Prime EPS stent. Our first generation MGuard stent combining the MicroNet with a stainless steel stent received CE mark approval for the treatment of coronary artery disease in the European Union in October 2007. We subsequently replaced the stainless steel stent with a more advanced cobalt-chromium based stent for MGuard Prime EPS.
 
The First in Men (FIM) study conducted in Germany from the fourth quarter of 2006 through the second quarter of 2008 focused on patients with occlusion in their stent graft. This group is considered to be in “high risk” for complications during and shortly after the procedure due to the substantial risk of occurrence of a thromboembolic event. The study demonstrated MGuard’s safety in this high risk group. This study was followed by the GUARD study in Brazil in 2007 with a similar patient population which reinforced the safety profile of MGuard in patients prone to procedural complications. The MAGICAL study was a pilot study in STEMI patients conducted in Poland from 2008 through 2012 which demonstrated safety, measured by MACE rates at 30 days following the procedure, as well as efficacy results, measured by the ability of MGuard to reestablish blood flow into the infarcted area of the muscle. Furthermore, we conducted three registries (iMOS, IMR and iMOS Prime) that confirmed the feasibility of MGuard and MGuard Prime EPS for the treatment of STEMI patients and the safety of MGuard and MGuard Prime EPS in the STEMI patient group. Safety was repeatedly demonstrated in these trials and registries by the low mortality rate in the first month after the procedure.
 
In the second calendar quarter of 2011, we began the MGuard for Acute ST Elevation Reperfusion Trial (which we refer to as our “MASTER I trial”), a prospective, randomized study, which demonstrated that among patients with acute STEMI undergoing emergency PCI, patients treated with MGuard had superior rates of epicardial coronary flow (blood flow within the vessels that run along the outer surface of the heart) and complete ST-segment resolution, or restoration of blood flow to the heart muscle after a heart attack, compared to those treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. The results of this trial are summarized in greater detail below.
 

-14-
----


Finally, the MASTER II trial, which we initially initiated as part of our efforts to seek approval of our MGuard Prime EPS by the FDA, was discontinued at our election in its current form in light of market conditions moving toward the use of drug-eluting stents over bare-metal stents. Analysis of the patients already enrolled in the MASTER II trial prior to its suspension, however, reconfirmed the MASTER I safety results due to a continued low mortality rate.
 
MASTER I Trial
 
In the second calendar quarter of 2011, we began the MASTER I trial, a prospective, randomized study in Europe, South America and Israel to compare the MGuard with commercially-approved bare metal and drug-eluting stents in achieving superior myocardial reperfusion (the restoration of blood flow) in primary angioplasty for the treatment of acute STEMI, the most severe form of heart attack. The MASTER I trial enrolled 433 subjects, 50% of whom were treated with MGuard and 50% of whom were treated with a commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. The detailed acute and 30 days results from the trial were presented at the TCT conference on October 24, 2012 and published (Prospective, Randomized, Multicenter Evaluation of a Polyethylene Terephthalate Micronet Mesh–Covered Stent (MGuard) in ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction, Stone et. al, JACC, 60; 2012). The results were as follows:

● | The primary endpoint of post-procedure complete ST-segment resolution (restoration of blood flow to the heart muscle after a heart attack) was statistically significantly improved in patients randomized to the MGuard compared to patients receiving a commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stent (57.8% vs. 44.7%). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Patients receiving MGuard exhibited superior rates of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 3 flow, which evidences normal coronary blood flow that fills the distal coronary bed completely, as compared to patients receiving a commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stent (91.7% vs. 82.9%), with comparable rates of myocardial blush grade 2 or 3 (83.9% vs. 84.7%) and corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC) (17.0 vs. 18.1 
● | Angiographic success rates (attainment of <50% final residual stenosis of the target lesion and final TIMI 3 flow) were higher in the MGuard group compared to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents (91.7% vs 82.4%). 
● | Mortality (0% vs. 1.9%) and major adverse cardiac events (1.8% vs. 2.3%) at 30 days post procedure were not statistically significantly different between patients randomized to MGuard as opposed to patients randomized to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. All other major adverse cardiac event components, as well as stent thrombosis, were comparable between the MGuard and commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. 

 
The six month results from the MASTER I trial were presented at the 2013 EuroPCR Meeting, the official annual meeting of the European Association for Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions, on May 23, 2013 in Paris, France. The results were as follows:
 

● | Mortality (0.5% vs. 2.8%) and major adverse cardiac events (5.2% vs. 3.4%) at 6 months post procedure were not statistically significantly different between patients randomized to the MGuard as compared to patients randomized to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. All other major adverse cardiac event components, as well as stent thrombosis, were comparable between patients treated with MGuard and those treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The twelve month results from the MASTER I trial were presented at the TCT conference on October 29, 2013 and published (Mesh-Covered Embolic Protection Stent Implantation in ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Final 1-Year Clinical and Angiographic Results From the MGUARD for Acute ST Elevation Reperfusion Trial, Dudek et. al, Coronary Interventions, 2014). The results were as follows:
 

● | Mortality (1.0% vs. 3.3%) and major adverse cardiac events (9.1% vs. 3.3%) at 12 months post procedure were not statistically significantly different between patients randomized to the MGuard as opposed to those randomized to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. All other major adverse cardiac events, as well as stent thrombosis, were comparable between the MGuard and commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In summary, the MASTER I trial demonstrated that among patients with acute STEMI undergoing emergency PCI patients treated with MGuard had superior rates of epicardial coronary flow (blood flow within the vessels that run along the outer surface of the heart) and complete ST-segment resolution compared to those treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. In addition, patients treated with MGuard showed a slightly lower mortality rate and a slightly higher major adverse cardiac event rate as compared to patients treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents six and twelve months post procedure.
 
A detailed table with the results from the MASTER I trial is set forth below. The “p-Value” refers to the probability of obtaining a given test result. Any p value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

Future Clinical Trials for CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS
 
Post-marketing clinical trials (outside the United States) could be conducted to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CGuard EPS in specific indications. These trials would be designed to facilitate market acceptance and expand the use of the product. We expect to be able to rely upon CE mark approval of the product and other supporting clinical data to obtain local approvals.
 
We do not anticipate conducting additional post-marketing clinical trials for our bare-metal MGuard coronary products.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Our primary business objective is to utilize our proprietary MicroNet technology and products to become the industry standard for treatment of stroke, complex vascular and coronary disease and to provide a superior solution to the common acute problems caused by current stenting procedures, such as restenosis, embolic showers and late thrombosis. We are pursuing the following business strategies to achieve this objective.

● | Widen the adoption of CGuard EPS. We are seeking to expand the population of CGuard EPS patients in those countries in which CGuard EPS is commercially available. In particular, our focus is on establishing CGuard EPS as a viable alternative (in appropriate cases) to conventional carotid stents and vascular surgery within the applicable medical communities. We intend to accomplish this goal by continuing to publish and present our clinical data, support investigator-initiated clinical registries and exploring addition of a procedural protection device to our portfolio incorporating the principal of reverse flow of the carotid artery as an adjuctive alternative to femoral access. We have partnered and will continue to seek out partnerships with organizations focused on the treatment of stroke. We will also continue to engage advisory boards and to develop a network of key opinion leaders to assist us in our efforts to widen the adoption of CGuard EPS. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Portfolio expansion and pipeline development We will continue to invest in advancing our portfolio with new delivery system alternatives to facilitate the use of CGuard by all physicians. Our delivery systems will enable all endovascular access points including accessory devices for Arterial Venous (AV) shunting. 
● | Grow our presence in existing and new markets for CGuard EPS. We have launched CGuard EPS in most European and Latin American countries through a comprehensive distributor sales organizations network. We are continuing to focus on larger growing markets through this network by supporting our distributors with a comprehensive marketing and clinical education programs. In additional we have begun to sell direct to hospitals in certain markets and continue to evaluate the transition to a direct selling to hospitals model in certain currently served distributor markets, increasing our control on the market and gross profit margins. We are pursuing additional product registrations and distribution contracts with local distributors in other countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. In February 2021, we executed a distribution agreement with Chinese partners for the purpose of expanding our presence in China. Currently, we are seeking strategic partners for a potential launch of CGuard EPS in Japan. In addition, we are conducting a pivotal study of our CGuard™ Carotid Stent System, C-Guardians, for prevention of stroke in patients in the United States.

● | Continue to leverage our MicroNet technology to develop additional applications for interventional cardiologists and vascular surgeons. In addition to the applications described above, we believe that we will eventually be able to utilize our proprietary MicroNet technology to address imminent market needs for new product innovations to significantly improve patients’ care. We continue to broadly develop and protect intellectual property using our mesh technology. Examples of some areas include peripheral vascular disease and neurovascular disease. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Establish relationships with collaborative and development partners to fully develop and market our existing and future products. We are seeking strategic partners for collaborative research, development, marketing, distribution, or other agreements, which could assist with our development and commercialization efforts for CGuard EPS and other potential products that are based on our MicroNet technology. 

Competition
 
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, subject to change and impacted by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
 
Carotid
 
The carotid stent markets in the United States and Europe are dominated by Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific Corporation, Covidien Ltd. (currently part of Medtronic, Inc.), and Cordis Corporation (currently part of Cardinal Health, Inc.). Gore Medical and Terumo Medical Corporation produce a polytetrafluoroethylene mesh-covered stent and a double layer metal stent, respectively. All of these larger companies have substantially greater capital resources, larger customer bases, broader product lines, larger sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs and larger facilities than ours and have established reputations and relationships with our target customers, as well as worldwide distribution methods that are more effective than ours. However, we believe that the European market is somewhat fragmented, and, in our opinion, smaller competitors may be able to gain market share with greater flexibility.

Neurovascular
 
Leading industry players in the global neurovascular devices market include Medtronic, Stryker, Terumo and Johnson & Johnson. Acquisitions and mergers are increasingly used as a strategy for product portfolio expansion and to grow footprint. (Global Market Insights, Inc. - Devices Market Share 2018-2024 Industry Size Report. https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/neurovascular-devices-market)
Sales and Marketing
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Based on the positive CGuard EPS clinical data, we initiated the commercial launch of CGuard EPS in CE marked countries in early 2015. In September 2015, we announced full market launch of CGuard EPS in Europe. Since 2017 we are focusing on sales of our products through local distribution partners and our own internal sales initiatives to gain greater reach into all the relevant clinical specialties and to expand our geographic coverage. Our current strategy seeks to broaden our sales efforts to increase CGuard EPS penetration within the community of interventionalists. In parallel, we aim at transitioning vascular surgeons from carotid endarterectomy procedures to carotid stenting with CGuard EPS and accessory devices, which we believe can greatly expand our customer base. We have focused and we plan to continue to focus our marketing efforts primarily on key growth markets and to evaluate opportunities in new territories if and when they become available. In addition, we are using international trade shows and industry conferences to gain market exposure and brand recognition. We continue to work with leading physicians to enhance our marketing effort and are developing relationships with new key opinion leaders to champion our technology and work with us in clinical studies. In additional we have begun to sell direct to hospitals in certain markets, such as France and the United Kingdom, in order to increase our growth in the market and gross profit margins.
 
As a result of declining sales of the MGuard Prime EPS, which we believe is largely driven by the predominant industry preferences favoring drug-eluting stents rather than bare metal stents such as MGuard Prime EPS in STEMI patients, we intend to phase out future sales of our MGuard Prime EPS in 2022.
 
Product Positioning
 
When treating carotid artery disease, we believe that CGuard has potential to become the standard of care in treading carotid artery disease. It is a second-generation stent with positive patient outcomes demonstrating significant reduction in post-procedural neurological events.
 
Additionally, we intend to continue to evaluate potential product enhancements and manufacturing enhancements for CGuard EPS expected to reduce cost of goods or provide the best-in-class performing delivery system and accessory solutions. We believe these improvements may allow us to reduce cost of goods and increase penetration in our existing geographies and better position us for entry into new markets. Finally, we do not expect that it would be crucial to use a drug-eluting stent platform to compete in certain new markets such as the neurovascular market, and hence, we plan to continue to explore this area of opportunity.
 
Insurance Reimbursement
 
In most countries, a significant portion of a patient’s medical expenses is covered by third-party payors. Third-party payors can include both government-funded insurance programs and private insurance programs. While each payor develops and maintains its own coverage and reimbursement policies, payors, in many instances, have similarly established policies, and in the U.S., for example, coverage policies and reimbursement rates of private payors are often influenced by those established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The CGuard products and MGuard coronary products sold to-date in applicable foreign countries have been designed and labeled to facilitate the utilization of existing reimbursement codes for such countries, and we intend to continue to design and label our present and future products in a manner consistent with this goal.

-18-
----


While most countries have established reimbursement codes for stenting procedures, certain countries may require additional clinical data before recognizing coverage and/or to obtain a certain level of reimbursement for one or more of our products. In these situations, we intend to complete the required clinical studies to obtain reimbursement approval in countries where it makes economic sense to do so.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
We have 53 issued patents, including 16 patents issued in the U.S., and 17 pending patent applications, 7 of which are pending in the United States. Many of these patents and applications cover aspects of our CGuard and MGuard technology. Patents outside the U.S. have been filed in Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Australia, and South Africa. The patents and applications fall into a number of patent families, as listed below:

The patents and patent applications listed above cover various aspects of our products, specifically focusing on the mesh sleeve covering our stents, as well as methods for production and delivery mechanisms of the stents. We believe that our patents, in particular those covering the use of a knitted micron-level mesh sleeve over a stent for various indications, as well as our pending patent applications (if issued as patents with claims substantially in their present form), create a significant barrier against other companies seeking to use similar technology. We believe these patents and patent applications collectively cover all our existing products and may be useful in protecting our future technological developments. We intend to aggressively continue patenting new technologies and to actively pursue any infringement of our key patents.
 
Trade Secrets
 
We also rely on trade secret protection to protect our interests in proprietary know-how and/or for processes for which patents are difficult to obtain or enforce. As part of our trade secret policy, we rely on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect trade secrets and other proprietary technology.

The trademarks are renewable indefinitely, so long as we continue using the marks and make the appropriate filings when required. We also use and may have common-law rights to various trademarks, trade names, and service marks.
 
Government Regulation
 
The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the European Union CE mark and other corresponding foreign agencies.

-20-
----


Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. These laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex approval process, clinical trials and production controls in others. As a result, the processes and time periods required to obtain foreign marketing approval may be longer or shorter than those necessary to obtain FDA market authorization. These differences may affect the timeliness of international market introduction of our products. For the European Union nations, medical devices must obtain a CE mark before they may be placed on the market. In order to obtain and maintain the CE mark, we must comply with the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC (“MDD”) by presenting comprehensive technical files for our products demonstrating safety and efficacy of the product to be placed on the market and passing initial and annual quality management system audit as per ISO 13485 standard by a European Notified Body. We have obtained ISO 13485 quality system certification and the products we currently distribute into the European Union display the required CE mark. In order to maintain certification, we are required to pass an annual surveillance audit conducted by Notified Body auditors. The European Union replaced the MDD with the new European Medical Devices Regulation, or MDR (MDR 2017/745, Council Directive 93/42/EEC). The MDR will apply after a transitional period of three years ending on May 26, 2021, which is expected to change several aspects of the existing regulatory framework in Europe. Manufacturers have the duration of the transition period to update their technical documentation and processes to meet the new requirements in order to obtain a CE Mark. After May 26, 2021, medical devices can still be placed on the market under the provision of the MDD until May 26, 2024; provided the CE Mark was issued prior to this date and the manufacturer continues to comply with this directive. By May 26, 2024, all medical devices entering the EU will need to have a CE Mark under the MDR, even if they have been on the market previously under the MDD. In our case, CGuard and MGuard Prime can continue to be marketed under the MDD until November 12, 2022. Specifically, the EU MDR will require changes in the clinical evidence required for medical devices, post-market clinical follow-up evidence, annual reporting of safety information for Class III products, Unique Device Identification (“UDI”) for all products, submission of core data elements to a European UDI database prior to placement of a device on the market, and multiple other labeling changes. Approvals for certain of our currently-marketed products could be curtailed or withdrawn as a result of the implementation and recertification process of the EU MDR and acquiring approvals for new products could be more challenging, time consuming and costly.
 
As noted below, we have or had regulatory approval and made sales of CGuard EPS, MGuard Prime EPS or both products either through distributors pursuant to distribution agreements or directly, in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Vietnam, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. While each of the European Union member countries accepts the CE mark as its sole requirement for marketing approval, some of these countries still require us to take additional steps in order to gain reimbursement rights for our products. Furthermore, while we believe that certain of the above-listed countries that are not members of the European Union accept the CE mark as a primary requirement for marketing approval, each such country requires additional regulatory requirements for final marketing approval of our products. Furthermore, we are currently targeting additional countries in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, however, even if all governmental regulatory requirements are satisfied in each such country, we anticipate that obtaining marketing approval in each country could take as few as three months or as many as twelve months or more, due to the nature of the approval process in each individual country, including typical wait times for application processing and review, as discussed in greater detail below.
 
In October 2007, our first generation MGuard stent combining the MicroNet with a stainless-steel stent received CE mark approval for the treatment of coronary artery disease in the European Union. We subsequently replaced the first generation MGuard product with MGuard Prime EPS, which uses a more advanced cobalt-chromium based stent. Our MGuard Prime EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in October 2010 and marketing approval in those countries listed in the table below.
 
The CGuard EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union on March 14, 2013 and marketing approval in the countries listed in the table below. We are currently seeking marketing approval for CGuard EPS in, South Korea.
 
Please refer to the table below setting forth the approvals and sales made for CGuard EPS and the MGuard Prime EPS on a country-by-country basis

FDA Government Regulation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects
 
Many of our activities are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and export of medical devices.
 
FDA Approval/Clearance Requirements
 
In the United States, most Class II or III medical devices must be cleared or approved by the FDA prior to commercialization. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market or wish to market in the United States must receive 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. Medical devices that receive 510(k) clearance are “cleared” by the FDA to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. Medical devices that obtain a premarket approval by the FDA are “approved” to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. We anticipate filing a premarket approval application, or PMA, in the future for our product and do not anticipate filing a 510(k) premarket notification, provided that the FDA will not instruct us otherwise. We cannot guarantee that we will obtain premarket approval, which will likely include clinical testing. Descriptions of the premarket approval and 510(k) clearance processes are provided below.
 
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory controls for medical devices, or the General Controls, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s quality system regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) process described below.
 
Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) process. Pursuant to the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA), as of October 2002, unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) submissions are subject to user fees. Certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. The FDA has recently indicated that it intends to modernize the 510(k) process and has issued new guidance documents that may change the way that devices are cleared by the FDA.
 
Class III includes devices with the greatest risk. Devices in this class must meet all of the requirements in Classes I and II. In addition, Class III devices cannot generally be marketed until they receive a premarket approval. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Under MDFUMA, PMAs (and supplemental PMAs) are subject to significantly higher user fees than 510(k) applications, and they also require considerably more time and resources.
 
The FDA decides whether a device line must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or premarket approval based on statutory criteria that utilize a risk-based classification system. Premarket approval is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices and, in many cases, Class II medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The FDA uses these criteria to decide whether a premarket approval or a 510(k) is appropriate, including the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination by the agency of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II. In many cases, the FDA requires the manufacturer to submit a 510(k) requesting clearance (also referred to as a premarket notification), unless an exemption applies. The 510(k) must demonstrate that the manufacturer’s proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed predicate device. A “predicate device” is a pre-existing medical device to which equivalence can be drawn, that is either in Class I, Class II, or is a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA. A product that lacks a predicate device will default to a Class III device, although a company may seek to submit a De Novo classification request, rather than a PMA. The De Novo request allows a regulatory pathway to classify novel medical devices for which general controls alone, or general and special controls, provide reasonable occurrence of safety and effectiveness for the intended use, but for which there is no legally marketed predicate device.

----


We expect that unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market or wish to market in the United States must receive 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. Medical devices that receive 510(k) clearance are “cleared” by the FDA to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. Medical devices that obtain a premarket approval by the FDA are “approved” to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. We anticipate that each device that we wish to commercialize will be considered a Class III device by the FDA and therefore we anticipate filing a PMA in the future and do not anticipate filing a 510(k) premarket notification, provided that the FDA will not instruct us otherwise. We cannot guaranty that we will obtain a premarket approval. Descriptions of the premarket approval and 510(k) clearance processes are provided below.
 
Premarket Approval Pathway
 
We expect that current and future applications of our technology will result in medical devices that are considered Class III devices subject to premarket approval. A PMA must be submitted if a device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process, unless FDA permits a De Novo application. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, analytical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing, statutory preapproval inspections, and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Before a premarket approval application is submitted, a manufacturer must apply for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to conduct clinical trials. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to file an IDE application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to initiation of enrollment of human subjects for clinical trials. The IDE provides the manufacturer with a legal pathway to perform clinical trials on human subjects where without the IDE, only approved medical devices may be used on human subjects.
 
The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as analytical, animal and laboratory testing results, manufacturing information, and an Investigational Review Board (IRB) approved protocol showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound, as well as ensuring patient informed consent is obtained. If the clinical trial design is deemed to have “non-significant risk,” the clinical trial may be eligible for “abbreviated” IDE requirements.
 
A clinical trial may be suspended by either the FDA or the IRB at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. Even if a study is completed, clinical testing results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, or they may be equivocal or otherwise insufficient to obtain approval of the product being tested. After the clinical trials have been completed, if at all, and the clinical trial data and results are collected and organized, a manufacturer may complete a premarket approval application.
 
After a PMA is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application,” although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, but it may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The preapproval inspections conducted by the FDA include an evaluation of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality Systems Regulations, as well as inspections of the clinical trial sites by the Bioresearch Monitoring group to evaluate compliance with good clinical practice and human subject protections. New premarket approval applications or premarket approval supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. Significant changes to an approved premarket approval require a 180-day supplement, whereas less substantive changes may utilize a 30-day notice, or a 135-day supplement. Premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application, and it may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 

-24-
----

510(k) Clearance Pathway
 
We do not currently market, distribute, or sell any products that have market clearance by the FDA under its 510(k) process. If, in the future, we develop products where 510(k) clearance is required, we would be required to submit a 510(k) demonstrating that such proposed devices are substantially equivalent to a respective previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of 510(k). The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months but could take longer. In some cases, the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
 
If a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, a premarket approval. The FDA requires each device manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a new 510(k) or a premarket approval, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of the modified device is obtained.
 
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
 
A host of regulatory requirements apply to our approved devices, including the quality system regulation (which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures), the Medical Device Reporting regulations (which require that manufacturers report to the FDA specified types of adverse events involving their products), labeling regulations, and the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses. Class II devices also can have special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidelines that do not apply to Class I devices.
 
A noncomprehensive list of the regulatory requirements that apply to our approved products classified as medical devices include:
 

● | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Quality Systems Regulations, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the development and manufacturing process; 
● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication; 
● | clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices (if obtained); 
● | approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our cleared devices (if obtained); 
● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; 
● | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; 
● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; 
● | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; 
● | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and, 
● | notices of corrections or removals. 


-25-
----


We do not currently have a registered establishment with the FDA. If we are approved or cleared to manufacture, prepare, or process a device in the United States, we and any third-party manufacturers that we may use will be required to register our establishments with the FDA. As such, we and our manufacturing facilities will be subject to FDA inspections for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation. Additionally, some of our subcontractors may also be subject to FDA announced and unannounced inspections for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation. These regulations will require that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and quality control activities. As a medical device manufacturer, we will further be required to comply with FDA requirements regarding the reporting of adverse events associated with the use of our medical devices, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. FDA regulations also govern product labeling and prohibit a manufacturer from marketing a medical device for unapproved applications.
 
Our CGuard EPS is classified as a Class III medical device by the FDA. Class III medical devices are generally the highest risk devices and are therefore subject to the highest level of regulatory control by the FDA, since the FDA process of premarket approval involves scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices for the purpose(s) intended. The FDA will either approve or deny a premarket approval application and we cannot market a device unless or until the FDA approves a premarket approval application.
 
We expect the approval process in the U.S. to take a significant amount of time, require the expenditure of significant resources, involve rigorous clinical investigations and testing, and potentially require changes to products. The approval process may result in limitations on the indicated uses of the medical devices for which we are able to obtain approval (since the FDA can take action against a company that promotes off-label uses) and will also require increased post-market surveillance.
 
U.S. Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
In addition to the FDA regulations, there are a variety of other healthcare laws and regulations to which we may be subject if any of our products are marketed, sold, distributed, and/or utilized in the United States. In the United States, we may be subject to the oversight of FDA, Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG), the Center for Medicare/Medicaid Services (CMS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), in addition to others. We supply products that may be reimbursed by federally funded programs such as Medicare. As a result, our activities may be subject to regulation by CMS and enforcement by OIG and DOJ. Of specific note are federal and state fraud and abuse laws, which prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration, including the offer or solicitation of such payment, intended to induce or reward the purchase, recommendation or generation of business involving healthcare products any item or service payable by a health-care program. Other provisions of federal and state laws prohibit presenting, or causing to be presented, to third party payors (including, government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid) for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. In addition, other healthcare laws and regulations may apply, such as transparency and reporting requirements, and privacy and security requirements. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA as medical devices, such as us, and hospitals, physicians and other institutional or individual providers that may refer or purchase such products. The healthcare laws that may be applicable to our business or operations include, but are not limited to:
 

● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits a person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for or to induce referring or recommending an individual to another person to receive items or services or to purchase, lease, order, or arrange for any good, facility, item or service payable in whole or in part under a Federal health care program; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-26-
----


● | Federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other government healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program, knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly makes a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which includes provisions that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, and for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations and requirements on healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform certain services for them that involve the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, with respect to safeguarding the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information; 
● | The federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act, including the provision commonly referred to as the Open Payments Act or Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
● | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to referrals and items or services reimbursed by both governmental and non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal law, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Customers
 
Our customer base is varied. We began shipping our MGuard product to customers in Europe in January 2008 and CGuard product to customers in Europe in 2014 and have since expanded our global distribution network to Southeast Asia, India, Latin America and Israel. We currently have distribution agreements for our CE mark-approved CGuard EPS with medical product distributors based in Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America. We are currently in discussions with additional distribution companies in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
 
Most of our current agreements with our distributors stipulate that, and we expect our future agreements with our distributors to stipulate that, while we shall assist in training by providing training materials, marketing guidance, marketing materials, and technical guidance, each distributor will be responsible for carrying out local registration, sales and marketing activities. In addition, in most cases, all sales costs, including sales representatives, incentive programs, and marketing trials, will be borne by the distributor. Under current agreements, distributors purchase stents from us at a fixed price. Our current agreements with distributors are generally for a term of two to three years.
 
On February 3, 2021, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with three China-based partners, pursuant to which the Chinese partners will be responsible for conducting the necessary registration trials for commercial approval of our products in China, followed by an exclusive distribution right to sell our products in China. Under the Distribution Agreement, the China-based partners will be subject to minimum purchase obligations.
 
We have also recently engaged in direct sales in certain geographic markets such as United Kingdom and France.

The cobalt-chromium stent for our MGuard Prime EPS was designed by Svelte Medical Systems Inc. We have an agreement with Svelte Medical Systems Inc., as amended, that grants us a non-exclusive, worldwide license for production and use of the MGuard Prime cobalt-chromium stent for the life of the stent’s patent, subject to the earlier termination of the agreement upon the bankruptcy of either party or the uncured default by either party under any material provision of the agreement. Our royalty payments to Svelte Medical Systems Inc. are determined by the sales volume of MGuard Prime EPS. Currently, the royalty rate is 2.9% of all net sales.
 
We manufacture our CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS at our own facility. The bare-metal cobalt-chromium stents for our MGuard Prime EPS and the self-expanding bare-metal stents for our CGuard EPS are being manufactured and supplied by MeKo Laserstrahl-Materialbearbeitung. Our agreement with MeKo Laserstrahl-Materialbearbeitung for the production of electro polished L605 bare-metal stents for MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS is priced on a per-stent basis, subject to the quantity of stents ordered. The complete assembly process for MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS, including knitting and securing the sleeve to the stent and the crimping of the sleeve stent on to a delivery catheter, is done at our Israel manufacturing site. Once MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS have been assembled, they are sent for sterilization in a third-party facility in Israel, and then back to our facility for final packaging and distribution.
 
Each MGuard stent is manufactured from two main components, the stent and the mesh polymer. The stent is made out of cobalt chromium. This material is readily available, and we acquire it in the open market. The mesh is made from polyethylene terephthalate (polyester). This material is readily available in the market as well, because it is used for many medical applications.
 
A CGuard EPS consists of a CGuard stent and the delivery system. Each CGuard stent is manufactured from two main components, a self-expending nickel-titanium stent and the mesh polymer. This material is readily available and we acquire it in the open market. The mesh is made from polyethylene terephthalate (polyester). We have patent rights that cover the proposed CGuard stent with mesh. This material is readily available in the market as well, because it is used for many medical applications. In the event that our supplier can no longer supply this material in fiber form, we would need to qualify another supplier, which could take several months. The delivery system for CGuard is made out of polymer tubes we acquire from an original equipment manufacturer. In the event that our supplier can no longer supply this material, we would need to qualify another supplier, which could take several months. In addition, in order to retain the approval of the CE mark, we are required to perform periodic audits of the quality control systems of our key suppliers in order to ensure that their products meet our predetermined specifications.
 
Properties
 
Our headquarters are located in Tel Aviv, Israel, where we lease a 1,000 square meter office and manufacturing facility that has the capacity to manufacture and assemble 1,200 stents per month, based upon the production schedule of one shift per day. We believe that our current facility is sufficient to meet anticipated future demand by adding additional shifts to our current production schedule.
Human Capital Management
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 52 employees 50 full-time and 2 part-time, consisting of 2 in executive management, 5 in research and development, 7 in quality assurance and compliance, 5 in finance and accounting, 20 in operations/production, 10 in sales, marketing and clinical, and 3 in all other miscellaneous roles, Human resources, information technology services, and administration. Except for 5 of our employees in Europe, our employees are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We do not expect the collective bargaining agreements to which our employees are party to have a material effect on our business or results of operations. We also employ 3 independent contractors in Poland and 1 in Brazil.
 
We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. In particular, we depend on the skills, experience and performance of our senior management and research personnel. We compete for qualified personnel with other medical device, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, as well as universities and non-profit research institutions.
 
We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region and employment classification) include incentive compensation plan, pension, healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, family leave, and on-site services, among others. We also use targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly for our key employees.
 
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health and safety of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we follow government regulations which may include at certain periods having employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
 
We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
