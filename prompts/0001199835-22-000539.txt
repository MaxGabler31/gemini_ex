Item 1. Business
 
We are an oil exploration and production company, primarily engaged in acquisition and exploration efforts to find mineral reserves on various properties. From our inception in March 2008 through October 2009, we were primarily engaged in acquisition and exploration efforts for mineral properties. Beginning in October 2009, we shifted our focus to locating mature oil fields, with the intention of acquiring those oil fields and recovering stranded oil using enhanced recovery methods. From June 14, 2011 to December 31, 2020, we were a management services company, managing the acquisition and operation of mature oil fields, focused on the recovery of stranded oil from those mature fields using enhanced oil recovery methods for our then sole customer, Stranded Oil Resources Corporation, or SORC, then a wholly owned subsidiary of Alleghany Corporation. We performed those services in exchange for a quarterly management fee and the reimbursement from SORC of our employee related expenses, which fees and reimbursements were effectively all of our revenues prior to the closing of the Securities Purchase Agreement with Alleghany described below.
 
On December 31, 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Alleghany Corporation. Under that agreement, we purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of SORC. As consideration for the SORC shares, we paid Alleghany $72,678 in cash and agreed to pay Alleghany a seven-year royalty of 5.0% of our future revenues and net profits from our oil, gas, gas liquids and all other hydrocarbons, subject to certain adjustments. Currently, there are no ongoing operations being conducted by SORC.
 
Under the Securities Purchase Agreement with Alleghany, we also entered into a Consulting Agreement, under which Alleghany paid us an aggregate of approximately $1.245 million during calendar year 2021 in exchange for our providing Alleghany with one to three years of consulting services from certain of our employees, including Mark See, our Chief Executive Officer.
 
Alleghany no longer pays us any management fees or reimbursement payments for the monthly expenses of our employees. Those fees and reimbursements were effectively all of our revenues prior to the closing of the Securities Purchase Agreement with Alleghany described above.
 
While we were providing services to Alleghany prior to December 31, 2020, we gained know-how and operational experience in evaluating, acquiring, operating and developing oil and gas properties using enhanced oil recovery methods. We also gained experience in designing, drilling and producing conventional oil wells without using those methods.
 
We have identified and leased 45,246 gross acres, and 37,932 net acres, of mineral property interests in the State of Montana. We have identified ten drilling locations in the area and began to drill one exploratory well in 2022. If that exploratory well yields the results we anticipate, we plan to continue to develop the leased area by drilling ten new wells. We expect that each such future well in the field will have a footprint of approximately 80 acres, resulting in coverage of a total of 800 acres. This will include less than two percent of the total acreage under lease. The results we obtain from this acreage will largely depend on the success of our first exploratory well. If we cannot achieve sufficient results from this well, we will have difficulty in securing additional funding to drill additional wells in this area.
 
In connection with our securing the acreage in Montana described above, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lustre Oil Company LLC, or Lustre, entered into an Acquisition and Participation Agreement with Erehwon Oil & Gas, LLC, or Erehwon. The agreement with Erehwon allows us to acquire oil and gas interests, and drill, complete and equip wells, in Valley County, Daniels County and Roosevelt County, Montana. Our agreement with Erehwon also specifies calculations for royalty interests and working interests we will receive for the first ten well completions, and first ten well recompletions, which is defined as the completion of a well for production from an existing well bore in another formation. We will acquire the initial mineral leases, and pay 100% of the initial acquisition costs, up to $500,000. When the total costs exceed $500,000, Erehwon has the option to acquire a 10% working interest in any lease we acquired by paying us 10% of our acquisition cost of that lease, resulting in our paying 90% of the applicable leases acquisition costs. Until we are repaid the full amount we paid to complete the first ten wells and first ten recompletions in the acreage, the working interest split will remain 10% to Erehwon and 90% to us. After we have recovered our acquisition costs, Erehwon will receive a 20% working interest. Additional wells and recompletions will have a working interest split equal to 10% to Erehwon and 90% to us, unless Erehwon exercises its option to increase its working interest by 10%, as described above.

Under the Erehwon agreement, we fund 100% of the construction costs of the first ten wells and first ten completions. The lease acquisition costs of any additional wells will be funded 80% by us and 20% by Erehwon; provided, however, that Erehwon will have the option to repay to us 10% of our acquisition costs to increase its working interest to 20%. Royalty expense for these wells will consist of a royalty interest to the landowner and an overriding royalty interest of between 3% and 6% for two individuals who generated the prospects. The two individuals who generated the prospects will also receive an amount equal to 5% of the cost of the first ten new completed wells and the first ten completed recompletions.
 
In January 2022, we executed a Net Profits Interest Agreement with Erehwon and Olfert No. 11-4 Holdings, LLC, or Olfert Holdings, for the purpose of funding the first well, Olfert #11-4, under the Acquisition and Participation Agreement described above. In exchange for Olfert Holdings funding of the development of the first well, Olfert Holdings receives 90% of funds resulting from Olfert #11-4 prior to Payout and 50% after Payout. The Net Profits Interest Agreement defines Payout as the point in time when the aggregate of all Net Profits Interest payments made to Olfert Holdings under the agreement equals 105% of the total well development costs.
 
In January 2022, we also entered into the operating agreement for Olfert Holdings. Pursuant to this operating agreement, we agreed to make a capital contribution to Olfert Holdings in the amount of $500,000, out of an aggregate of $1,500,000 of capital to be raised by Olfert Holdings. As of May 31, 2022, we were credited with a contribution totaling $59,935 of well development costs, representing a 5.5% interest in Olfert Holdings, based upon the market value of the assets we contributed. Since then, other investors, including our chief financial officer (see Related Party Transactions), assumed and funded our remaining capital contribution commitment.
 
On June 30, 2020, we entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement of Cat Creek Holdings LLC, a Montana limited liability company, forming a joint venture with Lipson Investments LLC and Viper Oil & Gas, LLC for the purchase of certain oil and gas properties in the Cat Creek Field in Petroleum County and Garfield County in the State of Montana. Cat Creek Holdings entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement with Carrell Oil Company on July 1, 2020. Upon closing under that agreement, Cat Creek Holdings paid Carrell Oil $400,000 in cash, subject to certain adjustments resulting from pre- and post-effective date revenue, expense and tax allocations, in exchange for the Cat Creek Field properties. We invested $448,900 in Cat Creek Holdings for 50% of its ownership interests. Lipson Investments LLC and Viper Oil & Gas, LLC, the other two members of Cat Creek Holdings, have ownership interests of 25% each, which they received for their respective investments of $224,450. Cat Creek Holdings is managed by four managers, two of which are designated by us.
 
Competition
 
Our operating results are largely impacted by competition from other oil and gas companies in all areas of operation, including the acquisition of mature fields. Our competitors include large, well established, companies with substantially more capital resources than we have.
Oil and Gas Price Volatility
 
Market prices for oil and gas decreased significantly in the first six months of calendar year 2020, as the combination of the COVID-19 global pandemic and geopolitical tensions among the worlds energy producers resulted in the simultaneous reduction of demand and increase in supply of crude. This price reduction has adversely affected the results, prospects and values of energy-related businesses. These businesses are likely to remain under pressure until the uncertainty around the pandemic decreases and the price of energy products recovers. Although oil and gas prices have recovered over the second half of calendar year 2021 and the first half of calendar year 2022, reaching over $100 per barrel, they still remain volatile.

Operating Hazards and Uninsured Risks
 
Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered. We believe that the cost and timing of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and that drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including low oil prices, title problems, reservoir characteristics, weather conditions, equipment failures, delays by project participants, compliance with governmental requirements, shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services and increases in the cost for such equipment and services. Future oil recovery activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 
Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for and producing and transporting oil, such as fires, natural disasters, explosions, encountering formations with abnormal pressures, blowouts, craterings, pipeline ruptures and spills, any of which can result in the loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution, personal injury claims and other damage to our properties and those of others. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above. In particular, the insurance we maintain does not cover claims relating to failure of title to oil leases, loss of surface equipment at well locations, business interruption, loss of revenue due to low commodity prices or loss of revenues due to well failure. The occurrence of an event that is not covered, or not fully covered, by insurance which we maintain or may acquire, could have a material adverse effect on our sales in the period such event may occur.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Oil and natural gas exploration, production, transportation and marketing activities are subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations promulgated by federal and state legislatures and agencies, including but not limited to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and various state regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with such laws, rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties, including the delay or stopping of our operations. The legislative and regulatory burden on the oil industry increases our cost of doing business.
 
State regulatory agencies, as well as the federal government when operating on federal or Indian lands, require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil. These governmental authorities also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. In each jurisdiction, we will most likely need exceptions to some regulations requiring regulatory approval. All of these matters could affect our operations.
 
Environmental Matters
 
The oil industry is subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment, as well as safety and health. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation is generally toward stricter standards, and this trend is likely to continue. These laws and regulations may require a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences, and for certain other activities, limit or prohibit access, seismic acquisition, construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas, impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from its operations, and require the reclamation of certain lands.
 
The permits that are required for oil and gas operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities.

Federal regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil to prepare and implement spill prevention, control countermeasure and response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. For onshore and offshore facilities that may affect waters of the United States, the OPA requires an operator to demonstrate financial responsibility. Regulations are currently being developed under federal and state laws concerning oil pollution prevention and other matters that may impose additional regulatory burdens on participants in the oil and gas industry. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require permits to be obtained to authorize discharge into surface waters or to construct facilities in wetland areas. The Clean Air Act of 1970 and its subsequent amendments in 1990 and 1997 also impose permit requirements and necessitate certain restrictions on point source emissions of volatile organic carbons (nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide) and particulates with respect to certain of our operations. The EPA and designated state agencies have in place regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff and stationary sources of air emissions. These programs require covered facilities to obtain individual permits, participate in a group or seek coverage under an EPA general permit. Most agencies recognize the unique qualities of oil and natural gas exploration and production operations. A number of agencies, including but not limited to MSHA, the EPA, the BLM, and similar state commissions, have adopted regulatory guidance in consideration of the operational limitations on these types of facilities and their potential to emit pollutants.
