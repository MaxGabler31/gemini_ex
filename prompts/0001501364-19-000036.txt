Description of Business
The Bank is a state-chartered stock savings bank organized in Connecticut in 1858. The Company, through United Bank, delivers financial services to individuals, families and businesses primarily in Connecticut and Massachusetts, including retail, commercial and consumer banking, as well as financial advisory services. United maintains 58 retail banking locations, commercial and mortgage loan production offices and 71 ATMs. Personal and business banking customers also bank with United online through its website at www.bankatunited.com as well as its mobile and telephone banking channels.
Our Four Key Objectives
The Company seeks to organically grow through favorable risk adjusted returns; continually deliver superior value to its customers, stockholders, employees and communities, and periodically consider merger/acquisition opportunities, through achievement of its four key operating objectives, which are to:

1. | Align earning asset growth with organic capital and low cost core deposit generation to maintain strong capital and liquidity;


• | During the year ending December 31, 2018, loans and deposits grew 5.9% and 9.1%, respectively, from the prior year end, and capital grew 2.8% over the same time period.


• | The Company grew non-interest bearing deposit accounts 2.7% in the year ending December 31, 2018 from the prior year end.


2. | Re-mix cash flows into better yielding risk adjusted return on assets with lower funding costs relative to peers;


• | Continued growth focused on commercial business loans, which increased 5.5% year over year.


• | Continued discipline with the risk-adjusted return on capital (“RAROC”) model.


3. | Invest in people, systems and technology to grow revenue and improve customer experience while maintaining an attractive cost structure;


• | During 2018, the Company shifted its mortgage banking strategy to reflect customers’ preference to conduct business both over the Internet and through direct sales channels. Consequently, the mortgage business division was restructured to streamline the customer experience and improve efficiency.


• | The Company’s ratio of non-interest expense to average assets increased to 2.21% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2.10% and 2.11% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


4. | Grow operating revenue, maximize operating earnings, grow tangible book value and pay dividends. Achieve more revenue into non-interest income and core fee income;


• | During 2018, the Company continued its strategy of reducing its effective tax rate through utilization of tax exempt loans, municipal securities, and investments in bank owned life insurance, maintaining entities in our unconsolidated corporate structure that have state tax advantages, and maintaining a portfolio of tax credit investments that include alternative energy and affordable housing. These tax reduction strategies support tangible book value creation. Furthermore, the Company identified additional tax strategies and planning opportunities while completing the income tax return for the prior year, resulting in a $1.7 million income tax benefit associated


5

with the tax rate change as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.

• | The Company continued to pay its dividend, totaling $0.48 per share for each of the years ended 2018, 2017, and 2016.


• | Tangible book value per share totaled $11.54 as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.30 per share, or 2.7%, compared to $11.24 per share at December 31, 2017, which increased $0.71 per share, or 6.7%, in 2017 from December 31, 2016.


• | Revenue increased $9.4 million, or 4.3%, from 2017 and increased $16.9 million in 2017, or 8.4%, from 2016.

Enterprise Risk Management Approach
The Company has made significant investments in its enterprise risk management approach. Management has established committees that manage strategic risks of the Company including oversight of specialized groups that bring in a broader team to address tactical and operational considerations. Board Risk Committee (“BRC”) has oversight over several management committees that report into it, including the Management Asset Liability Committee (“ALCO”) which oversees interest rate risk management. Credit risk management is overseen by our Chief Credit Officer in conjunction with our Chief Risk Officer. 
Risk Committees & Operational Risks
Risk Management Steering Committee (“RMSC”) is responsible for ensuring overall compliance with the Company’s Risk Management Policy. RMSC reviews and approves new or revised business proposals as required by the Risk Management Policy to ensure that the initiative is within the Board approved risk tolerance levels. RMSC oversees and approves risk management practices deployed throughout the Company to assist the Board in identifying, assessing, measuring, controlling and monitoring the various risks that the Company faces. RMSC ensures that a risk management infrastructure is established to manage credit, interest rate, liquidity, market, legal, compliance, strategic, operation, and reputational risks. Further activities of the RMSC, includes reviewing the Risk Management Policy, monitoring exceptions to risk limits and making recommendations to the BRC for revisions to the Company’s risk tolerance levels. RMSC reviews and provides feedback on the annual Company-wide risk assessment report including providing corrective action plans for identified deficiencies, monitoring the Company’s risk profile and its ongoing and potential exposures to internal and external risks; reviews and recommends for approval to the Board Risk Committee any significant changes to the Company’s Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan, Bank Secrecy Act Program, Identity Theft Prevention Program, Annual Information Security Report and the Information Security Program and related policies; as well as review and approval of the Company’s high risk vendors and Incidence Response Plan. The RMSC is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer.
The Management Risk Committee’s (“MRC”) purpose is to review, consider and discuss the micro risks facing the Company.  The Company and the industry are confronted daily with new and ever-changing risks. The degree and magnitude of these risks can change; however, MRC recognizes that these risks can and will remain in some form and can be tied to macro events beyond Management’s control. The MRC functions as a mechanism to educate managers on risk management concepts and to establish open communication channels across business lines in which to understand and manage company-wide business risks and opportunities.  As Management is responsible for identifying, measuring, controlling and monitoring risks across the Company, the MRC is charged with the responsibility for reviewing the results of key risk assessments conducted by Management in the areas of Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (“BSA/AML”), Customer Identification Program (“CIP”), Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), Automated Clearing House (“ACH”), Internal Fraud, Operational, Vendor Management, Information Technology and Information Security recommending further enhancements to the Company’s risk management practices. Additional responsibilities include oversight of the Company’s compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley requirements, the review and approval of new or revised business proposals and staying abreast of new and changing risks facing the banking industry and the Company. Key to providing oversight of potential third-party risks, the MRC is also responsible for reviewing the adequacy of the Company’s formal Vendor Management Program and the ongoing monitoring activities of its significant vendors. The MRC 

6

members will report on key operational risks affecting their area of responsibilities and risk strategies to be deployed on an ongoing basis. The MRC is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk Officer reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. 

The Enterprise Risk Management Department (“ERM”) is responsible for the development and ongoing maintenance of a formal Vendor Management Program. This comprehensive program provides the requirements for the selection, due diligence, contract review and ongoing monitoring of vendors to identify, manage and control third-party risks (operational, financial, strategic, compliance, reputational and legal). The Enterprise Risk Management Department updates the Program as necessary to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and new regulatory guidance. It is the responsibility of Enterprise Risk to oversee the Company’s adherence with this Program and ensure proper vendor documentation is maintained.  Additionally, the ERM Department facilitates Management’s compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and oversees Management’s assessment of Operational risks.
The Company has developed a comprehensive Business Continuity Management (“BCM”) Program framework based on its size and complexity. Its goal is to minimize financial losses to the institution, serve customers and financial markets with minimal disruptions, and mitigate the negative effects of disruptions on business operations. We manage our Business Continuity Risk by establishing and implementing a policy and associated plans that help to ensure the availability of critical business processes. The BCM Plans reflect the following risk management objectives for the program: prioritization of business objectives and critical operations that are essential for business continuance; development and maintenance of BCM Plans to provide for the recovery and resumption of affected critical processes, including reliance on critical IT Services, Data, Applications & Equipment, Third Party Vendors, Facilities and Personnel. Periodic and as-necessary updates are made to each BCM Plan based on changes in United Bank’s organizational structure or business processes covered by any such plan, audit or independent function recommendations and lessons learned from validation exercises or actual events. 
The Company has made significant investments in the creation of a Financial Intelligence Unit (“FIU”) that ensures the Company maintains compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), USA PATRIOT Act and OFAC regulations. One of the main purposes of the FIU is to identify financial transactions that may involve tax evasion, money laundering or some other criminal activity. The Company has developed a robust BSA Program that includes a system of internal controls to ensure ongoing compliance based on the BSA Risk Assessment; independent audits; designation of a BSA/AML/OFAC Officer responsible for coordinating and monitoring day to day compliance; and training of all appropriate Company personnel on a periodic basis. The Company has developed a risk assessment that identifies the Company’s BSA/AML and OFAC risk profile. Our risk assessment consists of assessment of products, services, customers, entities and geographic locations. The risk assessment program is an ongoing process. The Board of Directors and senior management update the risk assessment periodically or when the Company’s risk profile changes in a material manner such as when new products and services are introduced, existing products and services change, high risk customer’s open and close accounts, or the Company expands through mergers and acquisitions. The Company maintains a comprehensive system for detecting and deterring such transactions that is commensurate with the Company’s risk for money laundering and terrorist financing. The FIU gathers information about the financial affairs of customers to understand and predict their intentions. 
The Company has established an Information Security Program and dedicated Department to protect customers’, employees’ and stakeholders’ information from unauthorized disclosure, modification and destruction. The Program ensures that the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information are protected by implementing Company-wide risk assessments, policies, standards, controls, procedures and reviews designed to manage and control risk and to secure information through technical, administrative and physical controls.
The Information Security Program includes a cybersecurity program that consists of identifying, measuring, mitigating, monitoring and reporting cybersecurity-related risks. The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (“NIST”) defines cybersecurity as “the process of protecting information by preventing, detecting, and responding to attacks.” Cyber incidents can have a significant financial, operational, legal and reputational impact to United. United uses the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s Cybersecurity Assessment Tool to assess United’s cybersecurity inherent risk profile and its maturity level. The Cybersecurity Assessment Tool is consistent with and maps to the National Institute Standards and Technology’s Cybersecurity Framework, providing a measurable and repeatable process to inform management of United’s risks and cybersecurity preparedness to enable Management and the Board to evaluate United’s cybersecurity maturity level across five domains (Cyber Risk Management and Oversight, Threat Intelligence and Collaboration, Cybersecurity Controls, External Dependency Management and Cyber Incident Management and Resilience) against risk tolerance levels. The Board Risk Committee approves the risk tolerance levels annually. At least annually, the results of the risk assessment and comparison to approved tolerance levels are presented to the Board for their approval.

Technology Governance
Technology Governance Committee (“TGC”) is responsible to act as a decision making authority over technology capital investments, technology resource allocation and utilization. The TGC approves and monitors key strategic technology projects and plans that are required to fulfill critical business outcomes. The TGC acts as a communication forum to exchange critical information to ensure that technology strategies and initiatives are optimized to achieve maximum business value. The TGC will review all strategic project progress, as well as address major project challenges and opportunities, as appropriate. Additionally, the TGC is updated regularly on key technology trends in the financial services sector that may affect technology direction, technology standards, and use of technology within the Company or in conjunction with its partners. Responsibilities include but are not limited to: (a) act as a strategic body and in the best interest of the enterprise as a whole; (b) improve communication between technology and the business units; (c) review and approve funding for all projects exceeding $30,000 for internal or external technology expense; (d) review and approve the annual Information Technology Strategic and Operational Plan; (e) participate in the annual resource planning and allocation for development, enhancements and production support; (f) participate in technology updates, presentations and/or briefings that are germane to the business and will cultivate an atmosphere of informed decision making relative to technology alternatives; (g) oversee the justification criteria for technology investment decisions and resource allocations; (h) validate and ensure that all technology projects have consistent and measurable justification; (i) ensure that technology decisions and priorities are consistent with the overall business strategy; (j) establish and adjust, as appropriate, the priority-setting process and score card; (k) provide approval for significant project scope changes and/or schedule changes, as appropriate; (l) review and approve, as required, significant unplanned expenditures related to projects contained within and/or added to the plan; (m) review and approve any major reallocation of resources made necessary by priority changes required to meet business needs; (n) be enlightened proponents of technology within the business community providing communication and support for TGC actions and decisions; and (o) support the objectives to comply with technology principles, standards and internal controls. The TGC is chaired by the Chief Information & Administration Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. 
Asset Liability Committee & Oversight
ALCO is responsible for ensuring overall compliance with the Company’s Asset Liability Management policies and suggesting changes to the BRC and Board of Directors for approval; as well as maintaining responsibility for the development and oversight of the Company’s asset/liability management strategies, management of the investment portfolio, liquidity risk management framework, loan and deposit pricing strategies, use of off-balance sheet hedging instruments and the supervision of the accuracy and adequacy of management information systems utilized for reporting and supplying data to the ALCO to fulfill its role on a timely basis. Further activities include but are not limited to reviewing and analyzing output from the internal Interest Rate Risk Model, interpreting economic data and outlooks for interest rates to develop strategies to respond proactively to changes in loan and deposit product offerings, reviewing asset allocation strategies and the relative risk/return profiles, reviewing capital allocation strategies and capital adequacy results, reviewing and approving strategies related to tax credit investments and performance, reviewing the Bank and Holding Company liquidity positions and respective borrowing capacities, expected loan demand, and recommend adjustments to strategy. The ALCO is further responsible for oversight of authorities delegated to the Investment Committee (“IC”), the Secondary Marketing Committee (“SMC”), the Retail Pricing Committee (“RPC”), and the Commercial Pricing Committee (“CPC”). The ALCO is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. The Chief Financial Officer reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. 
The IC is charged with the responsibility of advising ALCO, the Board and other key stakeholders of the investment policy, with implementation of investment portfolio strategy and compliance with investment policy guidelines. The IC shall formulate and propose investment policy modifications to the ALCO, BRC and Board and shall implement such changes to the policy as approved by the governing bodies. In addition, the IC shall oversee the performance monitoring of the investment assets of the Company by monitoring the management of the portfolio assets for compliance with investment guidelines, overseeing the purchase and sale of securities, reviewing duration and yield performance of the portfolio, addressing the implications of portfolio stress testing and assessing the performance of the assets relative to the Company’s peer group and market indices. The IC is also responsible for evaluating and assessing new investment strategies from a risk and reward perspective and ensuring that such strategies do not create exceptions to the existing policy. The IC meeting can occur through assembly of the ALCO; however, the IC may meet more frequently to assess the implications of market movements, regulatory changes and performance of the portfolio.  
ALCO shall serve as the strategic decision making and governing body for the secondary marketing initiative for the Company’s residential loan portfolio, with managing authority delegated to the SMC, which meets monthly. The SMC shall establish the Company’s budgeted pricing spreads through valuation of mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”), setting the price offering and selling of mortgages via the secondary market at the whole loan or securities level for the purposes of achieving the Company’s targeted gain on sale and servicing rights levels. The SMC manages the interest rate risk management of the open pipeline through the Board approved hedge instruments and a lock policy. The SMC also serves as the governor of new originations 

8

for the Company’s mortgage portfolio ensuring that the targeted asset mix is maintained at approved levels. The SMC produces monthly reporting of hedge and sale activity for ALCO as well as the Board level policy exception reporting.
ALCO is responsible for the strategic oversight of the Company’s deposit pricing strategies, with managing authority delegated to the RPC and CPC. The meeting of the respective committees can occur through the assembly of the ALCO; however, the RPC and CPC may meet more often as necessary, to address pricing opportunities and assess pricing strategy related to the Company’s retail, commercial and municipal deposit programs. The RPC is responsible for a review of the Company’s retail pricing strategy and deposit trends, while oversight of the commercial and municipal deposit trends is bestowed to CPC. Both RPC and CPC consider the implications related to anticipated deposit inflows or outflows to the Company’s structural liquidity ratios when making pricing decisions.  In the event that circumstances occur that result in a stress to the Company’s liquidity profile and activation of the Contingent Liquidity Plan, elevated and more frequent levels of deposit and liquidity reporting are to be provided to the ALCO and, depending on the perceived severity of the stress scenario, reporting is to be elevated to the Board of Directors.  Under normal operating conditions, the ALCO is responsible for reviewing pricing for the Company’s deposit programs, deposit specials, new deposit initiatives and the competitive landscape of the Company’s deposit footprint.
Credit Risk Management Oversight
The Company adheres to established underwriting practices which include, lending limits to specific borrowers, accountability throughout the approval process with established lending authorities and risk rating classification, which considers various financial performance metrics of the borrower. The Company has established an internal loan review process as well as an external loan review process via an independent third-party vendor in order to review originated loans. Findings from the external loan review are reported to the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Credit Officer, and the full report is presented to the Board Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. 
Delinquency and Watched Assets Committees are responsible for the oversight of loans which have experienced financial difficulties or have not made all contractual payments in accordance with the loan terms. Delinquencies are discussed on a monthly basis with special assets and collections in order to determine if there is any risk of loss. Adversely rated loans are presented quarterly to the Watched Asset Committee or Loans in Litigation Committee to determine loss exposure and related reserves. There are various credit management practices utilized to manage loans which are considered performing including the review of borrower financial performance, testing existing loan conditions and covenants, industry concentrations and the evaluation of economic and market risks. These credit management practices are established to determine overall risk prior to the loan becoming adversely classified. 
On a quarterly basis, credit risk management provides portfolio and asset quality reporting to the Board Risk Committee. Portfolio presentation materials include discussions of the various loan portfolios, loans to one borrower reporting, concentration to various industries, concentration in various geographical regions and other underwriting metrics which are critical to managing credit risk. Asset quality reporting includes items such as, non-performing loan totals, delinquencies, Troubled Debt Restructures (“TDR’s”), watched assets, loans in litigation, charge-offs and recoveries as well as the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease loss. The Credit Risk Management process is overseen by the Chief Credit Officer in close consultation with the Chief Risk Officer. Both the Chief Credit Officer and Chief Risk Officer report directly to the Chief Executive Officer.
 Competition
The Company is subject to strong competition from banks and other financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, commercial banks, finance and mortgage companies, credit unions, consumer finance companies, brokerage firms and insurance companies. Certain of these competitors are larger financial institutions with substantially greater resources, larger lending limits, larger branch systems and a wider array of commercial banking services than United. Competition from both bank and non-bank organizations is expected to continue. Competition could intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation, the increasing availability of products and services from non-banks, greater technological developments in the industry and banking regulatory reform.
The Company faces substantial competition for deposits and loans throughout its market area. The primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates, personalized services, the quality and range of financial services, convenience of office locations, online banking services, automated services and office hours. Competition for deposits comes primarily from other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, mutual funds and other investment alternatives. The primary factors in competing for loans are interest rates, loan origination fees, the quality and range of lending services, online services and personalized service. Competition for origination of loans comes primarily from other savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, mortgage brokers and commercial banks and from other non-traditional lending financial service providers such as internet 

9

based lenders and insurance and securities companies. Competition for deposits, for the origination of loans and for the provision of other financial services may limit the Company’s future growth.
Market Area
For our deposit gathering activities, we operate in primarily suburban market areas throughout Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island that have a stable population and household base. Currently, we maintain 58 retail banking branches covering markets throughout Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, providing customers access to full-service banking opportunities including retail and commercial banking, consumer and commercial lending, and financial advisory services. 
Our retail banking and lending offices are located in Connecticut throughout Hartford, Fairfield, New Haven, New London and Tolland Counties, in Massachusetts in West Springfield, Greater Springfield and Worcester regions, and recently expanded into Rhode Island with the Westerly Branch. In addition, we maintain a commercial loan production office and a mortgage loan origination office in New Haven County, supported by two retail branches in Hamden and North Haven, Connecticut. Our market area in Connecticut is located in the north central part of the state including, in part, the eastern and western parts of the greater Hartford metropolitan area, the central part of New Haven County and Fairfield County through our Westport loan production office. Our market area in Massachusetts covers a wide geography in the western and central parts of the state. 
Our Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island markets have a mix of industry groups and employment sectors, including financial services, wholesale/retail trade, construction and manufacturing as the basis of the local economy. The Company’s primary deposit gathering area consists of the communities and surrounding towns that are served by its branch network. 
Our primary lending area is much broader than our primary deposit gathering area and includes the entire state of Connecticut as well as Massachusetts and to a lesser extent other New England and certain Mid-Atlantic states, although; as of December 31, 2018, most of the Company’s loan portfolios are made to borrowers in its primary deposit gathering area. 
Lending Activities
General
The Company’s wholesale lending team includes bankers, cash management specialists and originators, underwriting and servicing staff in each of our disciplines in wholesale lending which includes commercial real estate, commercial business, business banking, cash management, and a shared national credits desk. Our consumer lending team includes the following disciplines which, in nearly all channels, drive lending activities: retail branches and retail lending, customer contact center which includes outbound calling, direct sales, correspondent lending, LH-finance and United Wealth Management, Inc. (“UWM”). 
The Company’s lending activities have historically been conducted principally in Connecticut and Massachusetts; however, as we seek to enhance shareholder value through favorable risk adjusted returns, we often will lend throughout the Northeast and to a lesser extent certain Mid-Atlantic states and other select states. The Company’s experience in our geographic areas we lend in allows us to look at a wide variety of commercial, mortgage, and consumer loans. Opportunities are first reviewed initially to determine if they meet the Company’s credit underwriting guidelines. After successfully passing an initial credit review, we then utilize the Company’s risk adjusted return on capital model to determine pricing and structure that supports or is accretive to the Company’s return goals. Our systematic approach is intended to create better risk adjusted return on capital. Through the Company’s Loan and Funds Management Policy, both approved by the Board of Directors, we set limits on loan size, relationship size and product concentration for both loans and deposits. Creating diversified and granular loan and deposit portfolios is how we mitigate risk and create improved return on risk adjusted capital. 
The Company can originate, purchase, and sell commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, residential and commercial construction loans, residential real estate loans collateralized by one-to-four family residences, home equity lines of credit and fixed rate loans, marine floor plan loans and other consumer loans. Loans originated and purchased totaled $1.75 billion in 2018, consisting primarily of commercial originations and retail production of $615.5 million and $506.7 million, respectively. Loans originated and purchased totaled $1.94 billion in 2017, consisting of commercial originations and retail production of $769.0 million and $589.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018, 14.3% of our total production was purchased compared to 12.5% at December 31, 2017.
Real estate collateralized the majority of the Company’s secured loans as of December 31, 2018, including loans classified as commercial loans. Interest rates charged on loans are affected principally by the Company’s current asset/liability strategy, the demand for such loans, the cost and supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by competitors. These factors are, in turn, affected by general economic and credit conditions, monetary policies of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, federal and state tax policies and budgetary matters.

10

The Company’s approach to lending is influenced in large part by its risk adjusted return models. With the high level of competition for high quality earning assets, pricing is often at levels that are not accretive to the Company’s aspirational equity return metrics. The Company utilizes a web-based risk adjusted return model that includes inputs such as internal risk ratings, the marginal cost of funding the origination, contractual loan characteristics such as interest rate and term and origination and servicing costs. This model allows the Company to understand the life-of-loan impact of the origination, leading to proactive and informed decision making that results in the origination of loans that support the Company’s aspirational return metrics. We seek to acquire, develop and preserve high quality relationships with customers, prospects and centers of influence that support our return goals and compensate our commercial bankers and branch management for improving returns on equity for their respective areas of responsibility.
Periodically, the Company will purchase loans to enhance geographical diversification and returns and gain exposure to loan types that we are unwilling to make infrastructure investments to originate ourselves. Total lending activities, including origination of loans as well as purchasing of loans in the calendar year of 2018, totaled $1.75 billion, of which 14.3% were purchased, compared to $1.94 billion, of which 12.5% were purchased, in the calendar year of 2017. Loans purchased by the Company are underwritten by us, are generally serviced by others (“SBO”), and undergo a robust due diligence process. Management performs a vigorous due diligence exercise on the originator, including visiting and observing first hand the servicer and its operational process and controls to ensure that the originator and servicer meet the standards of the Company. Financial modeling includes reviewing prospective yields, costs associated with purchasing loans, including servicing fees and assumed loss rates to ensure that risk adjusted returns of the target portfolio are accretive to our return goals. The Company has set portfolio and capital limits on each of its purchased portfolios and has hired staff to oversee on-going monitoring of the respective servicer and performance to ensure the portfolio performance is meeting our initial and on-going expectations. In the event that our expectations are not met, the Company has many remedies at its disposal, including replacing the servicer, ending its relationship with the originator and selling the entire target portfolio. Contractually, the Company has the ability to cross-sell dissimilar products to customers in its purchased portfolios allowing us to develop a relationship using our existing online and mobile channels that support servicing and acquisition of our current and prospective clients without the need for a brick and mortar branch.
The Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”) approves the Lending Policy on at least an annual basis. The Lending Policy addresses approval limits, appraisal requirements, debt service coverage ratios, loan concentration, loan to value and other matters relevant to sound and prudent loan underwriting.
Owner Occupied and Investor Commercial Real Estate Loans
The Company makes commercial real estate loans throughout its market area for the purpose of acquiring, developing, constructing, improving or refinancing commercial real estate where the property is the primary collateral securing the loan, and the income generated from the property is the primary repayment source. Small office buildings, industrial facilities and retail facilities normally collateralize commercial real estate loans. These portfolios also include commercial one-to-four family and multifamily properties. These properties are primarily located in Connecticut and Massachusetts, but also include the Northeast and certain Mid-Atlantic states. Beginning in 2006, the Company started its expansion of commercial real estate through the Northeast and certain Mid-Atlantic states and over that time has developed deep knowledge of markets we lend in, retained talented commercial bankers and underwriters specializing in the procurement, underwriting and monitoring of these relationships, and put in place a robust credit administration process, discussed further in this report. In addition to providing geographic diversification within the overall commercial real estate loan portfolio, originated loans meet our return hurdle rates supporting the Company’s return goals. Properties financed are high quality, income producing and have experienced sponsorships. Loans may generally be made with amortizations of up to 30 years and with interest rates that are fixed or adjust periodically. Most commercial mortgages are originated with final maturities of 20 years or less. The Company generally requires that borrowers have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of available cash flows before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.15 times. Loans may be originated up to 80% of the appraised value. Generally, commercial mortgages require personal guarantees by the principals. Credit enhancements in the form of additional collateral or guarantees are normally considered for start-up businesses without a qualifying cash flow history. Among the reasons for management’s continued emphasis on commercial real estate lending is the desire to invest in assets with yields which are generally higher than yields on one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, and are more sensitive to changes in market interest rates.
Commercial real estate lending generally poses a greater credit risk than residential mortgage lending to owner occupants. The repayment of commercial real estate loans depends on the business and financial condition of the borrower. Economic events and changes in government regulations, which the Company and its borrowers do not control, could have an adverse impact on the cash flows generated by properties securing commercial real estate loans and on the market value of such properties. Commercial properties tend to decline in value more rapidly than residential owner-occupied properties during economic recessions and individual loans on commercial properties tend to be larger than individual loans on residential properties. The Company seeks to minimize these risks through strict adherence to its underwriting standards and portfolio management processes. At December 31, 

11

2018, the Company’s outstanding owner occupied commercial real estate loans and investor commercial real estate loans totaled $443.4 million and $1.91 billion, respectively.
Commercial Business Loans
Commercial loans primarily provide working capital, equipment financing, financing for leasehold improvements and financing for expansion. Commercial loans are frequently collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, and/or general business assets and are generally supported by personal guarantees. Depending on the collateral used to secure the loans, commercial business loans are typically made up to 80% of the value of the loan collateral. A significant portion of the Company’s commercial and industrial loans are also collateralized by real estate, but are not classified as commercial real estate loans because such loans are not made for the purpose of acquiring, developing, constructing, improving or refinancing the real estate securing the loan, nor is the repayment source income generated directly from such real property. Periodically, the Company participates in a shared national credit (“SNC”) program, which engages in the participation and purchase of credits with other “supervised” unaffiliated banks or financial institutions, specifically loan syndications and participations. These loans generate earning assets to increase profitability of the Company and diversify commercial loan portfolios by providing opportunities to participate in loans to borrowers in other regions or industries the Company might otherwise have no access. The Company offers both term and revolving commercial loans. Term loans have either fixed or adjustable rates of interest and, generally, terms of between three and seven years and amortize on the same basis. Additionally, two market segments the Company has focused on is franchise and educational banking. The franchise lending practice lends to certain franchisees in support of their development, acquisition and expansion needs. The Company typically offers term loans with maturities between three to eight years with amortization from seven to ten years. These loans generally are on a floating rate basis with spreads slightly higher than the standard commercial business loan spreads. The educational banking practice consists of K-12 schools and colleges/universities utilizing both taxable and tax-exempt loan products for campus improvements, expansions and working capital needs. Generally, educational terms loans have longer dated maturities that amortize up to 30 years and typically offer the Company a full deposit and cash management relationship. Both the franchise and educational lending areas focus on opportunities across New England and certain Mid-Atlantic states.   
Commercial business loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting standards and enhanced risk assessments, including a quarterly review of portions of the portfolio and a review of new commercial loans by the Chief Credit Officer.
At December 31, 2018, the Company’s outstanding commercial business loan portfolio totaled $886.8 million, or 15.7%, of our total loan portfolio and included the following business sectors: manufacturing, professional services, wholesale trade, retail trade, transportation, educational and health services, contractors and real estate rental and leasing. Industry concentrations are reported quarterly to the Board Risk Committee.
Residential Real Estate Loans
A principal activity of the Company is to originate and sell loans secured by first mortgages on one-to-four family residences. Towards the end of 2018, the Company transitioned its approach to mortgage origination, and now originates residential real estate loans through a direct sales channel model: over the phone, online, or in person with a member of our direct sales team or with a branch manager in one of our retail bank branches within our branch footprint. Residential mortgages are generally underwritten according to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association (“Freddie Mac”) and Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) guidelines for loans they designate as “A” or “A-” (these are referred to as “conforming loans”). Private mortgage insurance is generally required for loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%. The Company also originates loans above conforming loan amount limits, referred to as “jumbo loans.” The Company may also sell loans to other secondary market investors, either on a servicing retained or servicing released basis. The Company is an approved originator of loans to be sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority and the Massachusetts Housing Finance Authority. 
Loan sales in the secondary market provide funds for additional lending and other banking activities. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent mortgagees, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. The Company sold $407.6 million and $332.6 million of residential mortgages into the secondary market in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company has continued to successfully shift to a purchase market model from a refinancing model, with purchase volume constituting 76.2% of 2018 volume compared to 65.7% of 2017 volume.

12

The Company retains the ability to sell loans from portfolio when secondary market returns are attractive. Additionally, the Company has implemented multiple secondary options, in order to ensure maximum pricing on loan sales, when it is in our best interest to do so. Furthermore, we continue to move towards variable cost structures where possible through expansion of incentive base pay. As a result, we expect mortgage banking will continue to contribute to the Company’s profits.
The Company offers adjustable rate mortgages (“ARM”) which do not contain negative amortization features. After an initial term of five to ten years, the rates on these loans generally reset every year based upon a contractual spread or margin above LIBOR. ARM loans reduce the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk. However, ARM loans generally pose credit risks different from the credit risks inherent in fixed rate loans primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying debt service payments of the borrowers rise, thereby increasing the potential for default. The Company also has interest only loans, which at December 31, 2018 represent 5.9% of the total residential real estate portfolio. Interest only loans are underwritten at the fully amortized rate (to include principal and interest) and are subject to the same higher credit standards as jumbo loans. As a result, interest only loans originated have higher credit scores and lower loan to value ratios than the existing residential portfolio. At year-end 2018, the Company’s ARM portfolio totaled $560.0 million.
The Company also originates loans to individuals for the construction and acquisition of personal residences. These loans generally provide for construction periods from 12 to 36 months followed by a permanent mortgage loan, and follow the Company’s normal mortgage underwriting guidelines.
At December 31, 2018, the Company’s outstanding residential loan portfolio totaled $1.31 billion, or 23.2% of our total loan portfolio.
Home Equity Loans
The Company offers home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, both of which are secured by one-to-four family residences. Home equity loans are offered with fixed rates of interest and with terms up to 15 years. The loan-to-value ratio for our home equity loans and lines of credit is generally limited to no more than 90%. Our home equity lines of credit have ten year terms and adjustable rates of interest which are indexed to the Prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal. Interest rates on home equity lines of credit are generally limited to a maximum rate of 18% per annum. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company purchased four home equity portfolios totaling $82.5 million, compared to purchased portfolios totaling $105.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. These loans are not serviced by the Company. The outstanding balance of the purchased home equity portfolio balance at December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $249.3 million and $246.5 million, respectively. The purchased home equity portfolio is secured by second liens. Purchased and originated home equity loans totaled $583.5 million, or 10.3%, of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, the unadvanced amounts of home equity lines of credit totaled $453.6 million.
Construction Loans
The Company originates both residential and commercial construction loans. Typically loans are made to owner-borrowers who will occupy the properties (residential construction) and to licensed and experienced developers for the construction of single-family home developments (commercial construction). We extend loans to residential subdivision developers for the purpose of land acquisition, the development of infrastructure and the construction of homes.
Residential construction loans to owner-borrowers generally convert to a fully amortizing long-term mortgage loan upon completion of construction which generally is 12 to 36 months. Commercial construction loans also generally have terms of 12 to 36 months. Some construction-to-permanent loans have fixed interest rates for the permanent portion of the loan, but the Company originates mostly adjustable rate construction loans. The proceeds of commercial construction loans are disbursed in stages and the terms may require developers to pre-sell a certain percentage of the properties they plan to build before the Company will advance any construction financing. Company officers, appraisers and/or independent engineers inspect each project’s progress before additional funds are disbursed to verify that borrowers have completed project phases.
Construction lending, particularly commercial construction lending, poses greater credit risk than mortgage lending to owner occupants. The repayment of commercial construction loans depends on the business and financial condition of the borrower and on the economic viability of the project financed. A number of borrowers have more than one construction loan outstanding with the Company at any one time. Economic events and changes in government regulations, which the Company and its borrowers do not control, could have an adverse impact on the value of properties securing construction loans and on the borrower’s ability to complete projects financed and, if not the borrower’s residence, sell them for amounts anticipated at the time the projects commenced. Construction lending contains a unique risk characteristic as loans are originated under market and economic conditions that may change between the time of origination and the completion and subsequent purchaser financing of the property. Construction loans totaled $108.1 million, or 1.9%, of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018.

13

 Other Consumer Loans
Other consumer loans totaled $410.2 million, or 7.3%, of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. Our other consumer loans generally consist of loans on high-end retail boats and small yachts ranging on average from $400,000 to several million dollars in value, new and used automobiles, home improvement loans, loans collateralized by deposit accounts and unsecured personal loans. While the asset quality of these portfolios is currently strong, there is increased risk associated with consumer loans during economic downturns as increased unemployment and inflationary costs may make it more difficult for some borrowers to repay their loans. During December 2015, the Company purchased two consumer loan portfolios consisting of marine retail loans and home improvement loans totaling $229.2 million. The outstanding balance on the 2015 purchases at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $95.5 million and $130.9 million, respectively. The marine retail loans are based on premium brands and the borrowers are financially strong. The home improvement loans are 90% backed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and consist of loans to install energy efficient upgrades to the borrowers’ one-to-four family residences. There were no additional loan portfolio purchases of marine retail loans during 2017 or 2018. In 2018, the Company purchased $73.4 million in unsecured home improvement loans, compared to $80.8 million of purchases of home improvement loans in 2017.
LH-finance, the Company’s marine lending unit, includes purchased and originated retail loans, which are classified as other consumer loans, and dealer floorplan loans, which are classified as commercial loans. The Company’s relationships are limited to well established dealers of global premium brand manufacturers. The Company’s top three manufacturer customers have been in business between 30 and 100 years. The Company has generally secured agreements with premium manufacturers to support dealer floor plan loans which may reduce the Company’s credit exposure to the dealer, despite our underwriting of each respective dealer. We have developed incentive retail pricing programs with the dealers to drive retail dealer flow. Retail loans are generally limited to premium manufacturers with established relationships with the Company which have a vested interest in the secondary market pricing of their respective brand due to the limited inventory available for resale. Consequently, while not contractually committed, manufacturers will often support secondary resale values which can have the effect of reducing losses from non-performing retail marine loans. Retail borrowers generally have very high credit scores, substantial down payments, substantial net worth, personal liquidity, and excess cash flow. Retail loans have an average life of four years and key markets include Florida, California, and New England.
Credit Risk Management and Asset Quality
One of management’s key objectives has been and continues to be to maintain a high level of asset quality. The Company utilizes the following general practices to manage credit risk:

• | Limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend;


• | Establishing a process for credit approval accountability;


• | Careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower, transaction, market and collateral risks;


• | Established underwriting practices;


• | Ongoing servicing of the majority of individual loans and lending relationships;


• | Continuous monitoring of the transactions and portfolio, market dynamics and the economy;


• | Periodically reevaluating the Company’s strategy and overall exposure to economic, market and other risks; and


• | Ongoing review of new commercial loans by the Chief Credit Officer.

Credit Administration is responsible for the completion of credit analyses for all loans above a specific threshold, for determining loan loss reserve adequacy and for preparing monthly and quarterly reports regarding the credit quality of the loan portfolio, which are submitted to senior management and the Board, and to ensure compliance with the credit policy. In addition, Credit Administration and the Special Assets Team are responsible for managing non-performing and classified assets. On a quarterly basis, the criticized loan portfolio, which consists of commercial, commercial real estate and construction loans that are risk rated Special Mention or worse, are reviewed by management, focusing on the current status and strategies to improve the credit.
The loan review function is outsourced to a third party to provide an independent evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower and the appropriateness of the risk rating classifications. The findings are reported to the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Credit Officer and the full report is then presented to the Board Risk Committee. This review is supplemented with selected targeted internal reviews of the commercial loan portfolio. Various techniques are utilized to monitor indicators of credit deterioration in the portfolios of residential real estate mortgages and home equity lines and loans, including the periodic tracking and analysis of loans with an updated FICO score. LTV is determined on non-accrual loans through either an updated drive-by appraisal or, less frequently, the use of computerized market data and an estimate of current value.

14

Classified Assets
Under our internal risk rating system, we currently classify loans and other assets considered to be of lesser quality as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by either the current net worth or the repayment capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with added weaknesses which make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as “loss” are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets that are individually reviewed for impairment are those that exhibit elevated risk characteristics that differentiate themselves from the homogeneous loan categories including certain loans classified as substandard, doubtful or loss.
The loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require risk classification or reclassification. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets.
Investment Activities
The securities portfolio is managed to generate interest income, to implement interest rate risk management strategies, and to provide a readily available source of liquidity for balance sheet management. Investment decisions are made in accordance with the Company’s investment policy and include consideration of risk, return, duration and portfolio concentrations. Compliance with the Company’s investment policy rests with the Chief Financial Officer. The ALCO meets monthly and reviews and approves investment strategies.
The Company may acquire, hold and transact in various types of investment securities in accordance with applicable federal regulations, state statutes and guidelines specified in the Company’s internal investment policy. Permissible bank investments include federal funds, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, interest-bearing deposits of federally insured banks, U.S. Treasury and government-sponsored agency debt obligations, including mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized loan obligations, municipal securities, investment grade corporate debt, mutual funds, common and preferred equity securities and Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”) stock.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses interest rate swap instruments for its own account and also offers them for sale to commercial customers that qualify for their own accounts, normally in conjunction with commercial loans offered by the Company to these customers. As of December 31, 2018, the Company held derivative financial instruments with a total notional amount of $1.84 billion. The Company has a policy for managing its derivative financial instruments, and the policy and program activity are overseen by ALCO. Interest rate swap counterparties are limited to a select number of national financial institutions and qualifying commercial customers. Collateral may be required based on financial condition tests. The Company works with a third-party firm which assists in marketing swap transactions, documenting transactions and providing information for bookkeeping and accounting purposes.
Sources of Funds
General
The Company uses deposits, repayments and prepayments of loans and securities, proceeds from sales of loans and securities, proceeds from maturing securities and borrowings to fund lending, investing and general operations.
Deposits
Deposits are the major source of funds for the Company’s lending and investment activities. Deposit accounts are the primary product and service interaction with the Company’s customers. The Company serves commercial, personal, non-profit and municipal deposit customers. Most of the Company’s deposits are generated from the areas surrounding its branch offices. The Company offers a wide variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. The Company also periodically offers promotional interest rates and terms for limited periods of time. The Company’s deposit accounts consist of interest-bearing checking (“NOW”), non-interest-bearing checking, regular savings, money market savings and time deposits. The Company emphasizes its transaction deposits – checking and NOW accounts for personal accounts and checking accounts promoted to businesses and municipalities. These accounts have the lowest marginal cost to the Company and are also often a core account for a customer relationship. The Company offers debit cards and other electronic fee producing payment services to transaction account customers. The Company is promoting remote deposit capture devices so that commercial accounts can make deposits from their place of business. The Company offers mobile check deposit services to customers with eligible accounts to allow for convenient and quick access to deposit checks directly into their accounts without visiting a branch. The Company’s time deposit accounts 

15

provide maturities from three months to five years. Additionally, the Company offers a variety of retirement deposit accounts to business and personal customers. Deposit service fee income also includes other miscellaneous transaction and convenience services sold to customers through the branch system as part of an overall service relationship.
Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit pricing strategy is monitored weekly by the Retail Pricing Committee, monthly by the ALCO and quarterly by the Board Risk Committee. Deposit pricing is set weekly by the Company’s EPC. When setting deposit pricing, the Company considers competitive market rates, FHLBB advance rates and rates on other sources of funds. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies, market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. To attract and retain deposits, we rely upon personalized customer service, marketing our products, long-standing relationships and competitive interest rates.
Borrowings
The Company is a member of the FHLBB and uses borrowings as an additional source of funding, particularly for daily cash management and for funding longer duration assets. FHLBB advances also provide more pricing and option alternatives for particular asset/liability needs. The FHLBB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a FHLBB member, the Company is required to own capital stock of the FHLBB, calculated periodically based primarily on its level of borrowings from the FHLBB. FHLBB borrowings are secured by a blanket lien on certain qualifying assets, principally the Company’s residential mortgage loans. Advances are made under several different credit programs with different lending standards, interest rates and range of maturities.
On September 23, 2014, the Company closed its public offering of $75.0 million of its 5.75% Subordinated Notes due October 1, 2024 (the “Notes”). The Notes were offered to the public at par. The Company is using the proceeds for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Notes are payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year.
Additional funding sources are available through securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”), Federal Funds lines of credit and other wholesale funding providers.
Risk Management 
United has a comprehensive Risk Management Program that provides a methodology to identify, assess, mitigate, monitor, manage and report inherent risks within the organization. United manages risk taking activities within the Board-approved risk framework through an enterprise-wide governance structure that outlines the responsibilities for risk management activities and oversight of the same. Risk management is fully integrated into the strategic planning process and plays a key role in the approval process for all new activities. The Management Risk Committee, Risk Management Steering Committee and the Board Risk Committee oversee United’s risk-related matters. United’s Risk Management Steering Committee is chaired by United’s Chief Risk Officer and is comprised of members of the Executive Team and the Enterprise Risk Manager. The Management Risk Committee is chaired by United’s Chief Risk Officer and is comprised of Risk Division officers and various members of line management.
As a regulated banking institution, United is examined periodically by federal and state banking authorities. The results of these examinations are presented to the full Board. Identified issues from such examinations are tracked by the Director of Internal Audit and compliance is reported to and reviewed by the Audit Committee. These examinations, in addition to the internal Compliance Department reports and Internal Audit reports, are reviewed by the Audit Committee. The Compensation Committee also incorporates risk considerations into incentive compensation plans.
The Chief Risk Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for oversight of the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management framework, which includes but is not limited to credit risk, operational risk management, business continuity management, compliance programs, information security, financial intelligence, vendor management, fraud and risk policy. The Director of Treasury, who reports to the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for overseeing market, liquidity and capital risk management activities and is closely monitored by the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Credit Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for overseeing credit risk as well as the Company’s loan workout and recovery activities. The Director of Internal Audit, who reports directly to the Audit Committee, is responsible for providing an independent assessment of the quality of internal controls for the Company.
Credit Risk
The Company manages and controls risk in its loan and investment portfolios through established underwriting practices, adherence to consistent standards and utilization of various portfolio and transaction monitoring activities. Written credit policies 

16

are in place that include underwriting standards and guidelines, provide limits on exposure and establish various other standards as deemed necessary and prudent. Additional approval requirements and reporting are implemented to ensure proper identification, rationale and disclosure of policy exceptions.
Credit Risk Management policies and transaction approvals are managed under the supervision of the Chief Credit Officer and are independent of the loan production and Treasury areas. The credit risk function oversees the underwriting, approval and portfolio management process, establishes and ensures adherence to credit policies and manages the collections and problem asset resolution activities in order to control and reduce classified and non-performing assets.
As part of the Credit Risk Management process, the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer hold regular meetings with senior managers to report and discuss key credit risk topics, issues and policy recommendations affecting the Company. Important findings regarding credit quality and trends within the loan and investment portfolios are regularly reported to the Board Risk Committee.
In addition to the Credit Risk Management team, there is an independent Credit Risk Review function, reporting to the Chief Risk Officer, that performs independent assessments of the risk ratings and credit underwriting process for the commercial loan portfolio. Credit Risk Review findings are reported to Executive Management and the Board by the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Credit Officer.
Market Risk
Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and other relevant market rates and prices, such as equity prices. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. Due to the nature of its operations, United is primarily exposed to interest rate risk. Accordingly, United’s interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by its ALCO and by its Board Risk Committee. ALCO’s primary goals are to manage interest rate risk to maximize earnings and net economic value in changing interest rate and business environments within previously approved Board risk limits.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk refers to the ability of the Company to meet a demand for funds by converting assets into cash or cash equivalents and by increasing liabilities at acceptable costs. Liquidity management involves maintaining the ability to meet day-to-day and longer-term cash flow requirements of customers, whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs. Liquidity sources include the amount of unencumbered or “free” investment portfolio securities the Company owns, deposits, borrowings, cash flow from loan and investment principal payments and pre-payments and residential mortgage loan sales. The Company also requires funds for dividends to shareholders, repurchase of shares, potential acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. Its sources of funds include dividends from the Bank, the issuance of equity and debt and borrowings from capital markets.
Both the Bank and the Company will maintain a level of liquidity necessary to achieve their business objectives under both normal and stressed conditions. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed by ALCO and reviewed regularly with the Board.
Capital Risk
United needs to maintain adequate capital in both normal and stressed environments to support its business objectives. ALCO monitors regulatory and tangible capital levels according to management targets and regulatory requirements and recommends capital conservation, generation and/or deployment strategies to the Board. ALCO also has responsibility for the Capital Management Plan and Contingent Liquidity Plan, and quarterly stress testing which are all reviewed with the Board Risk Committee. The Capital Management Plan and Contingent Liquidity Plan are approved annually by the Board.
Operational Risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from external events. The definition includes the risk of loss from failure to comply with laws, ethical standards and contractual obligations and includes oversight of key operational risks including cash transfer risk. United’s Chief Risk Officer oversees the management and effectiveness of United’s risk management program. The Chief Risk Officer oversees the Compliance Program, the Bank Secrecy Act Program, and the Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Programs. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for reporting on the adequacy of these risk management components and programs along with any issues or concerns to the Board.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
General
United Bank is a Connecticut-chartered stock savings bank and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Financial Bancorp, Inc., a stock corporation. United Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). United Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Connecticut Banking Department, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, as its deposit insurer. United Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the Connecticut Banking Department concerning its activities and financial condition. It must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers. In March 2016, the Company elected to become a financial holding company. As a registered financial holding company and a bank holding company it is subject to inspection, examination, and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHC Act”). As a financial holding company, the Company can engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. Any change in such regulations, whether by the Connecticut Banking Department, the FDIC or the FRB, could have a material adverse impact on the Bank or the Company.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
On July 21, 2010, the President of the United States signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). This law significantly changed the historical bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years.
The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. United Bank, as a bank with $10 billion or less in assets, will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by our primary bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorney generals the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires minimum leverage (Tier I) and risk-based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks, which will exclude certain instruments that previously have been eligible for inclusion by bank holding companies as Tier I capital, such as trust preferred securities.
A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution, rather than deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor for each account relationship category, retroactive to January 1, 2008. The legislation also increases the required minimum reserve ratio for the DIF, from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits, and directs the FDIC to offset the effects of increased assessments on depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.
Under the Dodd-Frank Act we are required to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using our proxy materials. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”) was signed into law on May 24, 2018, modifying certain, important Dodd-Frank provisions intended to relieve certain regulatory requirements and burden on institutions with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. The EGRRCPA requires the federal banking agencies to establish a Community Bank Leverage Ratio between 8% and 10% for which banks with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets that exceed the minimum ratio will be deemed to be “well-capitalized” and in compliance with risk based capital and leverage requirements. The EGRRCPA amended the Bank Holding Company Act to exempt banks with total assets of $10 billion or less from the Volcker Rule requirements. Other notable modifications to the prior Dodd-Frank provisions include: raising the threshold for which publicly traded bank holding companies are required to perform annual company run stress tests from $10 billion to

$250 billion in total assets, raising the threshold for which publicly traded bank holding companies are required to establish an independent risk committee of its board of directors from $10 billion to $50 billion, as well as raising the threshold from $2 billion to $10 billion for which banks may deem loans originated and retained as “qualified mortgages” for purposes of the ability-to-pay rule set forth by the CFPB. Despite these improvements and modifications, many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act remain in place and will continue to increase our operating and compliance costs.
Connecticut Banking Laws And Supervision
Connecticut Banking Commissioner:    The Commissioner regulates internal organization as well as the deposit, lending and investment activities of state chartered banks, including United Bank. The approval of the Commissioner is required for, among other things, the establishment of branch offices, including those in other states, and business combination transactions. The Commissioner conducts periodic examinations of Connecticut-chartered banks. The FDIC also regulates many of the areas regulated by the Commissioner, and federal law may limit some of the authority provided to Connecticut-chartered banks by Connecticut law.
Lending Activities:    Connecticut banking laws grant banks broad lending authority. With certain limited exceptions, loans to any one obligor under this statutory authority may not exceed 15%, and fully secured loans may not exceed an additional 10% of a bank’s capital and allowance for loan losses.
Dividends:    The Bank may pay cash dividends to the Company out of its net profits. For purposes of this restriction, “net profits” represents the remainder of all earnings from current operations. Further, the total amount of all dividends declared by a savings bank in any year may not exceed the sum of a bank’s net profits for the year in question combined with its retained net profits from the preceding two years. Federal law also prevents an institution from paying dividends or making other capital distributions that, if by doing so, would cause it to become “undercapitalized.” The FDIC may limit a savings bank’s ability to pay dividends. No dividends may be paid to the Company’s shareholders if such dividends would reduce regulatory capital below the amount of the liquidation account required by the Connecticut conversion regulations.
Powers:    Connecticut law permits Connecticut chartered banks to sell insurance and fixed and variable rate annuities if licensed to do so by the applicable state insurance commissioner. With the prior approval of the Commissioner, Connecticut banks are also authorized to engage in a broad range of activities related to the business of banking, or that are financial in nature or that are permitted under the BHC Act or the Home Owners’ Loan Act (“HOLA”), both federal statutes, or the regulations promulgated as a result of these statutes. Connecticut banks are also authorized to engage in any activity permitted for a national bank or a federal savings association upon filing notice with the Commissioner unless the Commissioner disapproves the activity.
Assessments:    Connecticut banks are required to pay annual assessments to the Connecticut Banking Department to fund the Department’s operations. The general assessments are paid pro-rata based upon a bank’s asset size.
Enforcement:    Under Connecticut law, the Commissioner has extensive enforcement authority over Connecticut banks and, under certain circumstances, affiliated parties, insiders, and agents. The Commissioner’s enforcement authority includes cease and desist orders, fines, receivership, conservatorship, removal of officers and directors, emergency closures, dissolution and liquidation.
Federal Regulations
Capital Requirements:    The Federal Reserve Board monitors our capital adequacy, on a consolidated basis, and the FDIC and Connecticut Department of Banking monitor the capital adequacy of the Bank. Under FDIC regulations, federally insured state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (“state non-member banks”), such as United Bank, are required to comply with minimum leverage capital requirements. For an institution determined by the FDIC to not be anticipating or experiencing significant growth and to be, in general, a strong bank holding company, rated composite 1 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Ranking System established by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the minimum capital leverage requirement is a ratio of Tier I capital to total assets of 4%. Tier I capital is the sum of common stockholders’ equity, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including any related surplus) and minority investments in certain subsidiaries, less intangible assets (except for certain servicing rights and credit card relationships) and certain other specified items.
The FDIC regulations require state non-member banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital in relation to regulatory risk-weighted assets. The ratio of regulatory capital to regulatory risk-weighted assets is referred to as a bank’s “risk-based capital ratio.” Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet items (including recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes and residual interests) across 17 risk-weighted categories ranging from 0% to 1250%, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. For example, under the FDIC’s risk-weighting system, cash and securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government are given a 0% risk weight, 

20

loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties generally have a 50% risk weight, and commercial loans have a risk weighting of 100%, however, certain investment securities risk-weighted under the simplified supervisory formula approach can carry a risk weight up to 1250%.
State non-member banks such as United Bank, must maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%, of which at least one-half must be Tier I capital. Total capital consists of Tier I capital plus Tier 2 or supplementary capital items, which include the allowance for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, cumulative preferred stock and certain other capital instruments, and a portion of the net unrealized gain on equity securities. The includible amount of Tier 2 capital cannot exceed the amount of the institution’s Tier I capital. Banks that engage in specified levels of trading activities are subject to adjustments in their risk-based capital calculation to ensure the maintenance of sufficient capital to support market risk.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (the “FDICIA”) required each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital standards for insured institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risk of nontraditional activities, as well as to reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family residential loans. The FDIC, along with the other federal banking agencies, has adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank’s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank’s capital adequacy. The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution’s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances.
As a financial and bank holding company, United Financial Bancorp, Inc. is subject to capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies similar to those of the FDIC for state-chartered banks. United Financial Bancorp, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity exceeds these requirements.
The current U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies’ risk-based capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord (“Basel I”) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”). The Basel Committee is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors/regulators from the major industrialized countries that meet under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland to develop broad policy guidelines for use by each country’s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply.
In 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, now officially identified by the Basel Committee as “Basel III.” Basel III, when implemented by the U.S. bank regulatory agencies and fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity.
As of January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank became subject to new rules that implemented changes to the regulatory capital framework for U.S. banks. The rules set minimum requirements for both the quantity and quality of capital held by community banking institutions. The final rule includes a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets of 4.5%, raises a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets to 6%, a minimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking organizations and a minimum total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 8%. Additionally, community banking institutions must maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets to avoid being subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The phase in period for the capital conservation buffer began for the Company on January 1, 2016, with full compliance phased in by January 1, 2019. The Company’s capital levels remain characterized as “well-capitalized” under the new rules. 
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action:    Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. An institution is deemed to be “well-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a common equity Tier I capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, a common equity Tier I capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, and generally a leverage ratio of 4% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a common equity Tier I capital ratio that is less than 4.5%, or generally a leverage ratio of less than 4%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, a common equity Tier I capital ratio that is less than 3%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it 

21

has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. As of December 31, 2018, United Bank was considered a “well-capitalized” institution.
“Undercapitalized” banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank’s compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status.
Transactions with Affiliates:    Under current federal law, transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (the “FRA”). In a holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of a savings bank and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the savings bank. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the savings bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to 10% of such savings bank’s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to 20% of capital stock and surplus. The term “covered transaction” includes, among other things, the making of loans or other extensions of credit to an affiliate and the purchase of assets from an affiliate. Section 23A also establishes specific collateral requirements for loans or extensions of credit to, or guarantees, acceptances on letters of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate. Section 23B requires that covered transactions and a broad list of other specified transactions be on terms substantially the same, or no less favorable, to the savings bank or its subsidiary as similar transactions with non-affiliates.
Loans to Insiders:    Further, Section 22(h) of the FRA restricts an institution with respect to loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders (“insiders”). Under Section 22(h), loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the institution’s total capital and surplus. Loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the Board. Further, under Section 22(h), loans to Directors, executive officers and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the bank’s employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA places additional limitations on loans to executive officers. In addition to enhancing restrictions on insider transactions, the Dodd-Frank Act increases the types of transactions with insiders subject to restrictions, including certain asset sales with insiders.
Enforcement:    The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including United Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
The FDIC has authority under Federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under limited circumstances. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.” The FDIC may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member institution under specific circumstances on the basis of the institution’s financial condition or upon the occurrence of other events, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; and (4) insufficient capital, or the incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts
The FDIC has adopted a risk-based insurance assessment system. The FDIC assigns an institution to one of three capital categories based on the institution’s financial condition consisting of (1) well-capitalized, (2) adequately capitalized or (3) undercapitalized, and one of three supervisory subcategories within each capital group. The supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned is based on a supervisory evaluation provided to the FDIC by the institution’s primary federal regulator and information which the FDIC determines to be relevant to the institution’s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance funds. An institution’s assessment rate depends on the capital category and supervisory category to which it is assigned. Assessment rates for insurance fund deposits range from 2.5 basis points for the strongest institution to 45 basis points for the 

22

weakest. DIF members are also required to assist in the repayment of bonds issued by the Financing Corporation in the late 1980’s to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.
As part of the Dodd-Frank bill, the FDIC insurance limit was permanently increased to $250,000 per depositor for each account relationship category. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the total FDIC assessments were $2.7 million, $3.1 million and $3.6 million, respectively. The FDIC has exercised its authority to raise assessment rates in the past and may raise insurance premiums in the future. If such action is taken by the FDIC it could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the Company.
The FDIC may terminate insurance of deposits if it finds that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The management of the Company does not know of any practice, condition or violations that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
Federal Reserve System
The FRB regulations require depository institutions to maintain non-interest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The FRB regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts. The Company is in compliance with these requirements.
Federal Home Loan Bank System
The Bank is a member of the FHLBB, which is one of the regional Federal Home Loan Banks composing the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions. As a member of the FHLBB, we are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLBB. While the required percentages of stock ownership are subject to change by the FHLBB, the Company was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLBB stock at December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company purchased $8.2 million and $6.3 million of FHLBB stock, respectively. The FHLBB repurchased $17.0 million and $9.6 million excess capital stock from the Company during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Holding Company Regulation
General:    As a registered bank holding company and financial holding company, United Financial Bancorp, Inc. is subject to comprehensive regulation and regular examinations by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board also has extensive enforcement authority over bank and financial holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Under Connecticut banking law, no person may acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a Connecticut-chartered bank, or any bank holding company of such a bank, without prior notification of, and lack of disapproval by, the Connecticut Banking Commissioner.
Under Federal Reserve Board policy, which has been codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength for its subsidiary bank. Under this policy, the Federal Reserve Board may require, and has required in the past, a holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. As a bank holding company, United Financial Bancorp, Inc. must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before: (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares); (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.
As a financial holding company with a bank subsidiary, the Company must comply with the Bank Holding Company Act which prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities which, by statute or by FRB regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks. The list of activities permitted by the FRB includes, among other things: (i) operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; (ii) performing certain data processing operations; (iii) providing certain investment and financial advice; (iv) underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; (v) leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; (vi) selling money orders, travelers’ checks and United States savings bonds; (vii) real estate and 

23

personal property appraising; (viii) providing tax planning and preparation services; (ix) financing and investing in certain community development activities; and (x) subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers.
Dividends:    The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies that the Company must comply with, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The FRB also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a holding company of a bank from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.”
Bank holding companies are required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the consolidated net worth of the bank holding company. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board.
Financial Modernization:    The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act permits greater affiliation among banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other companies under a new type of financial services company known as a “financial holding company.” A financial holding company essentially is a bank holding company with significantly expanded powers. Financial holding companies are authorized by statute to engage in a number of financial activities previously impermissible for bank holding companies, including securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; and merchant banking activities. The act also permits the Federal Reserve Board and the Department of the Treasury to authorize additional activities for financial holding companies if they are “financial in nature” or “incidental” to financial activities. A bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well-capitalized, well managed, and has at least a “Satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating. A financial holding company must provide notice to the Federal Reserve Board within 30 days after commencing activities previously determined by statute or by the Federal Reserve Board and Department of the Treasury to be permissible. In March 2016, United Financial Bancorp, Inc. received approval from to the Federal Reserve Board of its intent to be deemed a financial holding company. 
Miscellaneous Regulation
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002:    The Company is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”), which implements a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures for public companies designed to promote honesty and transparency in corporate America and better protect investors from corporate wrongdoing. In general, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandated important new corporate governance and financial reporting requirements intended to enhance the accuracy and transparency of public companies’ reported financial results. It established new responsibilities for corporate chief executive officers, chief financial officers and audit committees in the financial reporting process, and it created a new regulatory body to oversee auditors of public companies. It backed these requirements with new SEC enforcement tools, increased criminal penalties for federal mail, wire and securities fraud, and created new criminal penalties for document and record destruction in connection with federal investigations. It also increased the opportunity for more private litigation by lengthening the statute of limitations for securities fraud claims and providing new federal corporate whistleblower protection.
Section 402 of the Act prohibits the extension of personal loans to directors and executive officers of issuers (as defined in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). The prohibition, however, does not apply to loans advanced by an insured depository institution, such as the Company, that are subject to the insider lending restrictions of Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act.
The Act also required that the various securities exchanges, including the NASDAQ Global Select Stock Market, prohibit the listing of the stock of an issuer unless that issuer complies with various requirements relating to their committees and the independence of their directors that serve on those committees.
Community Reinvestment Act:    Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), as amended as implemented by FDIC regulations, a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial 

24

institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. United Bank’s latest FDIC CRA rating was “Satisfactory.”
Connecticut has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA which is also applicable to United Bank. The Connecticut version is generally similar to the CRA but utilizes a five-tiered descriptive rating system. Connecticut law requires the Commissioner to consider, but not be limited to, a bank’s record of performance under Connecticut law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. United Bank’s most recent rating under Connecticut law was “Satisfactory.”
Consumer Protection And Fair Lending Regulations:    The Company is subject to a variety of federal and Connecticut statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for certain types of violations.
The USA Patriot Act:    On October 26, 2001, the USA PATRIOT Act was enacted. The Act gives the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The Act also requires the federal banking regulators to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money-laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of an FDIC-insured institution. As such, if the Company or the Bank were to engage in a merger or other acquisition, the effectiveness of its anti-money-laundering controls would be considered as part of the application process. The Company has established policies, procedures and systems to comply with the applicable requirements of the law. The Patriot Act was reauthorized and modified with the enactment of the USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005.
Federal Securities Laws
United Financial Bancorp, Inc.’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Based on the foregoing, it is anticipated that the resource allocation burdens to support Regulatory compliance will need to increase. This will require continued infrastructure build and may negatively impact profitability to a material degree.
TAXATION
Federal
General:    The Company is subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company.
Method of Accounting:    For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns.
Bad Debt Reserves:    Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), United Financial Bancorp, Inc.’s subsidiary, United Bank, was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at our taxable income. As a result of the 1996 Act, United Bank was required to use the specific charge-off method in computing its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal tax return. Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve). At December 31, 2018, the subsidiary had no reserves subject to recapture in excess of its base year. 
Taxable Distributions and Recapture:    Bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 are subject to recapture into taxable income should the Bank fail to meet certain asset and definitional tests.
Alternative Minimum Tax:    The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), imposes an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (alternative minimum taxable income or “AMTI”). The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI. Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Job Act (“Tax Act”) enacted on December 22, 2017 for tax years after December 31, 2017, AMT has been repealed and any corporate 

25

AMT credit which accumulated through prior years AMT liabilities may offset the regular tax liability for any taxable year after 2017. In addition, the AMT credit is refundable for any taxable year beginning after 2017 and before 2022 in the amount equal to 50 percent (100 percent for taxable years beginning in 2021) of the excess credit for the taxable year. 
Net Operating Loss Carryovers:    As a result of the Tax Act, for net operating losses incurred in tax years after December 31, 2017, a corporation may no longer carryback net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. Additionally net operating loss usage is limited by the Tax Act to 80%. The 80 percent limitation on NOL deductions applies to losses generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and the elimination of carrybacks and indefinite extension of carryforwards applies only to NOLs generated in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017. NOLs generated in 2017 and earlier would retain their 20-year life and be available to offset 100 percent of taxable income, subject to certain limitations. At December 31, 2018, United Financial Bancorp, Inc. had net operating loss carryforwards of $900,000 for federal income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in 2029.
Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction:    The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The Tax Act changed the corporate dividends received deduction of 80% to 65% in the case of dividends received from corporations after December 31, 2017 with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, and corporations which own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only 50%, previously 70% for dividends prior to December 31, 2017, of dividends received or accrued on their behalf.
The Company is not currently under audit with respect to its federal tax returns which have not been audited for the past four years.
State
The Company reports income on a calendar year basis to various states, mainly including the State of Connecticut and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Generally, the income of financial institutions in Connecticut, which is calculated based on federal taxable income subject to certain adjustments, is subject to Connecticut tax. The Company and the Bank are currently subject to the corporate business tax at 7.5% of taxable income, subject to a 10% surcharge in 2018 and an 8% surcharge for tax years after 2018.
In 1998, the State of Connecticut enacted legislation permitting the formation of passive investment companies (“PIC”) by financial institutions. This legislation exempts qualifying passive investment companies from the Connecticut corporation business tax and excludes dividends paid from a passive investment company from the taxable income of the parent financial institution. United Bank established a passive investment company, United Bank Mortgage Company, in December 1998.
The Company believes it is in compliance with the state PIC requirements, however, the Company has not been audited by the Department of Revenue Services for such periods. If the state were to determine that the PIC was not in compliance with statutory requirements, a material amount of taxes could be due. The State of Connecticut continues to be under pressure to find new sources of revenue, and therefore could enact legislation to eliminate the passive investment company exemption. If such legislation were enacted, United Financial Bancorp, Inc. would be subject to higher state income taxes in Connecticut.
The Company also reports income on a calendar year basis to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Generally, Massachusetts imposes a tax of 9.0% on income taxable in Massachusetts, although Massachusetts Security Corporations are taxed at 1.32%.  Massachusetts taxable income is based on federal taxable income after modifications pursuant to state tax law. 
The Company is not currently under audit with respect to its state tax returns which have not been audited for the past five years.
