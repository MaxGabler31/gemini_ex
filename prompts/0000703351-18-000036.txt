ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
References to “Brinker,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in this Form 10-K are references to Brinker International, Inc. and its subsidiaries and any predecessor companies of Brinker International, Inc.
We own, develop, operate and franchise the Chili’s® Grill & Bar (“Chili’s”) and Maggiano’s Little Italy® (“Maggiano’s”) restaurant brands. The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in September 1983 to succeed to the business operated by Chili’s, Inc., a Texas corporation, which was organized in August 1977. We completed the acquisition of Maggiano’s in August 1995. 
Restaurant Brands
Chili’s Grill & Bar
Chili’s, a recognized leader in the bar & grill category of casual dining, has been operating restaurants for over 40 years. Chili’s enjoys a global presence with locations in 31 countries and two territories outside of the United States. Whether domestic or international, company-owned or franchised, Chili’s is dedicated to delivering fresh, high-quality food with a unique point of view, as well as dining experiences that make people feel special. Historically, Chili’s menu has featured bold, kicked-up American favorites, and Chili’s has built a reputation for gourmet burgers, sizzling fajitas, baby back ribs and hand-shaken margaritas. We have refocused on and reinvested in these core equities, and we plan to continue to innovate our food offerings within these core menu platforms. We believe our focused menu, our “Chilihead” culture and our reputation for hospitality will allow Chili’s to differentiate our food and service from other restaurants.
We also believe that guests are evolving not only their standards of food quality but also their expectations of convenience. Chili’s To Go menu is available on-line, by calling the restaurant, or through our mobile app. In the summer of 2017, we began offering curbside service in all our company-owned restaurants for orders placed through our website or mobile app. Curbside service has now been expanded and is available at most franchise restaurants. In fiscal 2018, we relaunched our My Chili’s Rewards program and began offering a free chips and salsa or soft drink to members at every visit. Our database of guests in our My Chili’s Rewards program increased by approximately 20% in fiscal 2018.

During the fiscal year ended June 27, 2018, at our company-owned restaurants, entrée selections ranged in menu price from $6.00 to $19.49. The average revenue per meal, including alcoholic beverages, was approximately $15.70 per person. Also during fiscal 2018, food and non-alcoholic beverage sales constituted approximately 85.9% of Chili’s total restaurant revenues, with alcoholic beverage sales accounting for the remaining 14.1%. Our average annual net sales volume per company-owned Chili’s restaurant during fiscal 2018 was $2.8 million.
Maggiano’s Little Italy
Maggiano’s is a full-service, national, casual dining Italian restaurant brand with a passion for making people feel special. The exterior of each Maggiano’s restaurant varies to reflect local architecture; however, the interior of all locations transport our guests back to a classic Italian-American restaurant in the style of New York’s Little Italy in the 1940s. Our Maggiano’s restaurants feature individual and family-style menus, and most of our restaurants also have extensive banquet facilities designed to host large party business or social events. We have a full lunch and dinner menu offering chef-prepared, classic Italian-American fare in the form of appetizers and entrées with bountiful portions of pasta, chicken, seafood, veal, prime steaks and desserts. On Saturdays and Sundays, all Maggiano’s restaurants offer a brunch menu alongside our lunch menu. Our Maggiano’s restaurants also offer a full range of alcoholic beverages, including a selection of handcrafted classic cocktails and premium wines. In addition, Maggiano’s offers a full carryout menu as well as local delivery services.
During the fiscal year ended June 27, 2018, entrée selections ranged in menu price from $12.95 to $47.95. The average revenue per meal, including alcoholic beverages, was approximately $28.40 per person. Also during fiscal 2018, food and non-alcoholic beverage sales constituted approximately 84.6% of Maggiano’s total restaurant revenues, with alcoholic beverage sales accounting for the remaining 15.4%. Sales from events at our banquet facilities made up 17.8% of Maggiano’s total restaurant revenues for the year. Our average annual sales volume per Maggiano’s restaurant during fiscal 2018 was $8.3 million.
Business Strategy
We are committed to strategies and a company culture that we believe are centered on long-term sales and profit growth, enhancing the guest experience and team member engagement. Our strategies and culture are intended to differentiate our brands from the competition, reduce the costs associated with managing our restaurants and establish a strong presence for our brands in key markets around the world.
We believe the restaurant industry has been building restaurants at a pace that exceeds consumer demand. Growing sales and traffic continues to be a challenge with increasing competition and heavy discounting in the casual dining industry. We regularly evaluate our processes and menu at Chili’s to identify opportunities where we can improve our service quality and food. During fiscal 2018, we cut our menu offerings by a third compared to the prior year, and focused on our core equities of burgers, ribs, fajitas and margaritas. This initiative improved kitchen efficiency and allowed our managers and cooks to deliver our food hotter and faster to our guests. We also invested in the quality of our food and brought bigger burgers, meatier ribs and fajitas to our guests. Additionally, we launched a margarita of the month platform that features a new margarita every month at an every-day value price of $5.00. As fiscal 2018 ended, our average delivery time in the dining room has improved by approximately one minute compared to the year before, and our burger, fajita and margarita businesses are all growing.
We remain competitive with our value offerings at both lunch and dinner and are committed to offering consistent, quality products at a compelling every day value. During the latter half of fiscal 2018, we offered a promotional “3 for $10” platform that allowed guests to combine a starter, a non-alcoholic drink and an entree for just $10.00. We plan to leverage our scale and business model to continue this promotional platform in fiscal 2019, and we believe that few of our competitors can match this promotional value on a consistent basis. In the latter half of fiscal 2018, we also relaunched our My Chili’s Rewards program and moved away from the points system that is characteristic of most retail and restaurant loyalty programs. Our simple program currently provides customized offers to loyalty members, that includes free chips and salsa or soft drink on every visit. We will continue to seek opportunities to reinforce value and create interest for the Chili’s brand with new and varied offerings to further enhance sales and drive incremental traffic.

The Chili’s brand continues to leverage technology to improve convenience for our guests and to create a digital guest experience that we believe will help us engage our guests more effectively. Our database of guests in our My Chili’s Rewards program increased by approximately 20% in fiscal 2018, and we are able to give our loyalty members customized offers tied to their purchase behavior. We anticipate that guest loyalty programs will be a significant part of our marketing strategy going forward. We also have put greater emphasis on advertising our To Go capabilities. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Chili’s grew its To Go business by double digit sales increases every month compared to the prior year. To Go sales grew to be approximately 11.5% of total Chili’s To Go and dine-in sales by the end of fiscal 2018. We believe that guests will continue to prefer more convenience and options that allow them to eat at home, and we plan to continue investments in our digital guest experience and To Go capabilities.
We believe that improvements at Chili’s will have a significant impact on the business; however, our results will also benefit through additional contributions from Maggiano’s and our global Chili’s business. Maggiano’s opened one restaurant in fiscal 2018, and Maggiano’s is expected to open one franchise location in fiscal 2019. Guests are responding favorably to the addition of Saturday and Sunday brunch, together with our lunch menu, at all Maggiano’s restaurants. Maggiano’s is committed to delivering high quality food and a dining experience in line with this brand’s heritage.
Our global Chili’s business continues to grow with locations in 31 countries and two territories outside of the United States. Our international franchisees opened 34 new restaurants in fiscal 2018, including our first Chili’s restaurants in the countries of Chile and Panama. We plan to strategically pursue expansion of Chili’s internationally through development agreements with new and existing franchise partners. 
Company Development
Over the past fiscal year, we continued the expansion of our restaurant brands domestically through a select number of new company-owned restaurants in strategically desirable markets. We concentrate on the development of certain identified markets that are most likely to improve our competitive position and achieve the desired level of marketing potential, profitability and return on invested capital. Our domestic expansion efforts focus not only on major metropolitan areas in the United States but also on smaller market areas and non-traditional locations (such as airports and universities) that can adequately support our restaurant brands. For smaller market areas, we have developed a newer smaller prototype building for both brands that allows us to expand into these markets and serve our guests while maintaining a focus on profitability and return on invested capital.
The restaurant site selection process is critical, and we devote significant effort to the investigation of new locations utilizing a variety of sophisticated analytical techniques. Our process evaluates a variety of factors, including: trade area demographics, such as target population density and household income levels; physical site characteristics, such as visibility, accessibility and traffic volume; relative proximity to activity centers, such as shopping centers, hotel and entertainment complexes and office buildings; and supply and demand trends, such as proposed infrastructure improvements, new developments and existing and potential competition. Members of each brand’s executive team inspect, review and approve each restaurant site prior to its lease or acquisition for that brand.
The specific rate at which we are able to open new restaurants is determined, in part, by our success in locating satisfactory sites, negotiating acceptable lease or purchase terms, securing appropriate local governmental permits and approvals, and by our capacity to supervise construction and recruit and train management and hourly team members.

Franchise | — | | 1 
Chili’s international: | |

Franchise | 34 | | 33-38
Total | 46 | | 40-47

We periodically re-evaluate company-owned restaurant sites to ensure attributes have not deteriorated below our minimum standards. In the event site deterioration occurs, each brand makes a concerted effort to improve the restaurant’s performance by providing physical, operating and marketing enhancements unique to each restaurant’s situation. In some cases the brand considers relocation to a proximate, more desirable site, or evaluates closing the restaurant if the brand’s measurement criteria, such as return on investment and area demographic trends, do not support relocation. We closed thirteen company-owned restaurants in fiscal 2018 that were generally performing below our standards or were near or at the expiration of their lease terms. We relocated two company-owned restaurants in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2019, we plan to relocate five company-owned restaurants. Relocations are not included in the above table. Our strategic plan is targeted to support our long-term growth objectives, with a focus on continued development of those restaurant locations that have the greatest return potential for the Company and our shareholders. 
Franchise Development
In addition to our development of company-owned restaurants, our restaurant brands pursue expansion through our franchisees.
As part of our strategy to expand through our franchisees, our franchise operated locations increased in fiscal 2018. The following table illustrates the percentages of franchise operations as of June 27, 2018 for the Company and by restaurant brand, respectively:

 | Percentage of FranchiseOperated Restaurants
 | Domestic(1) | | International(2) | | Overall(3)

Chili’s | 25 | % | | 99 | % | 42 | %
Maggiano’s | — | % | | — | % | — | %

International
We continue our international growth through development agreements with new and existing franchise partners, introducing Chili’s to new countries and expanding the brand within our existing markets. As of June 27, 2018, we had 20 total development arrangements. During fiscal 2018, our international franchisees opened 34 Chili’s restaurants. We entered into new development agreements with new and existing franchisees for development in Saudi Arabia and China. During fiscal 2018, we sold our Dutch subsidiary that held our equity interest in our Chili’s joint venture in Mexico to the franchise partner in the joint venture.
We plan to strategically pursue expansion of Chili’s internationally in areas where we see the most growth opportunities. Our international agreements provide the vehicle for payment of development fees and initial franchise fees in addition to subsequent royalty fees based on the gross sales of each restaurant. We expect future agreements to remain limited to enterprises that demonstrate a proven track record as a restaurant operator and showcase financial strength that can support a multi-unit development agreement.
Domestic
We remain committed to finding and working with new and existing domestic franchise partners to develop more restaurants. We plan to accomplish this through new or existing development and franchise agreements with new or existing franchisees. In addition, we have from time to time also sold and may sell company-owned restaurants to our franchisees (new or existing). As of June 27, 2018, three domestic development arrangements existed. Similar to our international agreements, a typical domestic agreement provides for payment of development and initial franchise fees in addition to subsequent royalty and advertising fees based on the gross sales of each restaurant. We expect future domestic agreements to remain limited to enterprises having significant experience as restaurant operators and proven financial ability to support and develop multi-unit operations.
During the fiscal year ended June 27, 2018, our domestic franchisees opened five Chili’s restaurants.
Restaurant Management
Our Chili’s and Maggiano’s brands have separate designated teams who support each brand, including operations, finance, franchise, marketing, human resources and culinary. We believe these strategic, brand-focused teams foster the identities of the individual and uniquely positioned brands. To maximize efficiencies, brands continue to utilize common and shared infrastructure, including, among other services, accounting, information technology, purchasing, legal, and restaurant development.
At the restaurant level, management structure varies by brand. A typical restaurant is led by a management team including a general managing partner, two to six additional managers, and for Maggiano’s, an additional three to four chefs. The level of restaurant supervision depends upon the operating complexity and sales volume of individual locations.
We believe there is a high correlation between the quality of restaurant management and the long-term success of a brand. In that regard, we encourage increased experience at all management positions through various short and long-term incentive programs, which may include equity ownership. These programs, coupled with a general management philosophy emphasizing quality of life, have enabled us to attract and retain key team members, and enjoy turnover of managers and team members that we believe is below industry averages.
We strive to ensure consistent quality standards in our brands through the issuance of operations manuals covering all elements of operations and food and beverage manuals, which provide guidance for preparation of brand-formulated recipes. Routine visitation to the restaurants by all levels of supervision enforces strict adherence to our overall brand standards and operating procedures. Each brand is responsible for maintaining their operational training program. Depending on the brand, the training program typically includes a training period of two to three months for restaurant management trainees, as well as special training for high-potential managers. We also provide recurring management training for managers and supervisors to improve effectiveness or prepare them for more responsibility.

Supply Chain
Our ability to maintain consistent quality and continuity of supply throughout each restaurant brand depends upon acquiring products from reliable sources. Our approved suppliers and our restaurants are required to adhere to strict product and safety specifications established through our quality assurance and culinary programs. These requirements are intended to ensure high-quality products are served in each of our restaurants. We strategically negotiate directly with major suppliers to obtain competitive prices. We also use purchase commitment contracts when appropriate to stabilize the potentially volatile pricing associated with certain commodity items. All essential products are available from pre-qualified distributors to be delivered to our restaurant brands. Additionally, as a purchaser of a variety of food products, we require our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct, which sets forth our expectation on business integrity, food safety and food ingredients, animal welfare and sustainability. Due to the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants, which consist primarily of food, beverages and supplies, have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to revenues. Internationally, our franchisees may encounter cultural and regulatory differences resulting in variances with product specifications for international restaurant locations.
Advertising and Marketing
As a “polished casual” restaurant, with 52 locations, Maggiano’s primarily targets guests from affluent households who live and work around the higher-end malls where the majority of Maggiano’s restaurants are located. Maggiano’s relies on digital marketing, direct marketing, social media and word of mouth to advertise to new guests. As a large, nationally penetrated bar and grill brand, Chili’s appeals to a broader population. More than 50 million Americans visit Chili’s every three months, ranging across all income and ethnic groups. As casual-dining traffic has softened in recent years, we have worked hard to be more precise in defining the Chili’s target guest. Today our primary focus for developing menu innovation and targeting our TV and digital advertising are the Generation X and Millennial families who desire quality food, good value and a service experience that allows them to connect with family and friends. These young families represent a significant percentage of our guest base today and, we believe, will only grow in importance in the years ahead.
Our domestic Chili’s franchise agreements generally require advertising contributions to us by the franchisees. We use these contributions, in conjunction with company funds, for the purpose of retaining advertising agencies, obtaining consumer insights, developing and producing brand-specific creative materials and purchasing national or regional media to meet the brand’s strategy. Some franchisees also spend additional amounts on local advertising. Any such local advertising is required to be approved by us.
Team Members
As of June 27, 2018, we employed 58,478 team members, of which 577 were restaurant support center personnel in Dallas and 4,504 were restaurant regional and area directors, managers, or trainees. The remaining 53,397 were employed in non-management restaurant positions. Our executive officers have an average of 25 years of experience in the restaurant industry.
We have a positive team member relations outlook and have reached record-high internal engagement rates. In addition, our turnover rates are low for the industry. We have a variety of strong resources to help us recruit and retain the best talent to work in our restaurants and restaurant support center. This includes our comprehensive education program, Best You EDU, which launched in January 2018 and provides foundational learning, GED and associate degree programs at no cost to the participating team member. We have also developed a new restaurant position, Certified Shift Leader, which gives our hourly team members a clear path into management and growing their long-term career with our company. This position is nationally accredited as an apprenticeship through the National Restaurant Association Education Foundation and U.S. Department of Labor. Additionally, we continue to invest in developing digital and on-the-job training programs to further engage restaurant team members and set them up to achieve results.
The majority of our team members, outside of restaurant management and restaurant support center personnel, are paid on an hourly basis. We stand firm in the belief that we provide competitive working conditions and wages

favorable to other companies in our industry. Our team members are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
Cyber Security
