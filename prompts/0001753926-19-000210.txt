On July 31, 2015, by a vote of the majority of our shareholders, we changed our name from “Independence Energy Corp.” to “RedHawk Holdings Corp.”, increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to 450,000,000, and authorized the issuance of 5,000 shares of preferred stock with an initial stated value of $1,000 per share.
 
On December 31, 2015, the Company received from Beechwood Properties, LLC (“Beechwood”) a working capital injection of approximately $1.9 million of cash and marketable securities, net of an approximately $1.0 million line of credit with a 3.5% per annum interest rate. This infusion was received in exchange for 1,000 shares of the Company’s newly designated 5% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, $1,000 stated value. Additionally, Beechwood converted into 100 shares of the Company’s 5% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $1,000 par value, (“Series A Preferred Stock”), $100,000 of the Company’s outstanding obligation to Beechwood. Beechwood is owned by G. Darcy Klug, the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of the board of directors and the holder of a majority of the of the voting power of the Company’s common stock.
 
On December 31, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of certain high-quality medical products technology, including the tangible and intangible assets, for the Disintegrator Insulin Needle Destruction Unit (originally referred to as “The Disintegrator™” and has been renamed “SANDD™”) and the Carotid Artery Non-Contact Thermometer. The SANDD mini™ is, to the Company’s knowledge, the only needle destruction device which has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for both home and clinical use.
 
On March 24, 2016, RedHawk Pharma UK Ltd (“RedHawk Pharma”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RedHawk, signed a definitive agreement with Scarlett Pharma LTD (“Scarlett”) to complete the acquisition of a 25% ownership investment in EcoGen (the “EcoGen Agreement”), a United Kingdom based company specializing in the manufacturing and marketing of certain branded generic pharmaceuticals and medical devices. During the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company entered into a share transfer agreement wherein RedHawk increased its ownership position in EcoGen to 75%, and then later, the Company reached an agreement with Scarlett and its affiliate wherein RedHawk further increased its ownership position in EcoGen to 100%.
 
On September 22, 2018, RedHawk Medical Products, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired the world-wide exclusive manufacturing and distribution rights to certain intellectual properties which the Company believes, when re-engineered, will significantly expand the current market capabilities of its SANDD mini™ needle destruction unit. This new, re-engineered, needle incineration technology (the “SANDD Pro™”) will increase the Company’s needle incineration capabilities to include 14-gauge hypodermic needles and higher. Additionally, the re-engineered SANDD Pro™ technology will feature a portable, rechargeable, battery operated unit. This portable unit (the “SANDD Pro Portable™”) will incinerate, on a single charge, as many as 300 needles as thick as 21 gauge and higher. The SANDD Pro - Portable™ is ideal for field use by first responders, home health care nurses and veterinarians.
 
On January 31, 2017, the Company and Beechwood filed suit against Daniel J. Schreiber (“Mr. Schreiber”) and the Daniel J. Schreiber Living Trust – Dtd 2/08/95 (“Schreiber Trust”) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana under Civil Action No. 2:2017cv819-B(3) (the “Louisiana Lawsuit”). On March 22, 2019, the parties to the Litigations have entered into a Settlement Agreement and General Release (“Settlement Agreement”) to resolve all issues arising out of the subject matter of the Litigation. In consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and conditions contained in the Settlement Agreement, the parties to the Litigation agreed that (i) Mr. Schreiber and the Schreiber Trust would transfer all Company stock they presently own (52,377,108 common shares) to the Company and (ii) the Company shall (a) make to Mr. Schreiber and the Schreiber Trust a cash payment of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars (US$250,000.00) and (b) issue two Promissory Notes, each in the principal amount of Two Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars (US$200,000.00), one of which shall be due and payable on or before September 6, 2020 and the other shall be due and payable on or before September 5, 2021. 
 
On July 19, 2019, RedHawk Holdings Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, RedHawk Medical Products & Services, along with other affiliated entities, entered into a Consultant Agreement (“Consultant Agreement”) with Drew Pinsky, Inc. (“DPI”) f/s/o Dr. Drew Pinsky (“Consultant”), for Consultant to be the exclusive spokesperson for the Company’s Sharps Needle and Destruction Device (“SANDD”) mini™, SANDD Pro™ and any related products and/or accessories (“Products”) for an initial period of two years, subject to a two-year extension period under the terms and conditions described in the Consultant Agreement.
 
On September 11, 2019, RedHawk Holdings Corp. announced, among other things, that the ticker symbol for the Company’s common stock on the OTC Market would be changing from “IDNG” to “SNDD.” Beginning on September 12, 2019, the Company’s common stock was listed for quotation under the new symbol.
 
On September 16, 2019, the Company announced the sale of $500,000 in aggregate principal amount of new convertible notes in a private offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
CURRENT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
 
Needle Destruction Devices. The SANDD™ needle incineration units are Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) compliant.
 
We believe SANDD™ needle incineration devices are compatible for use in healthcare facilities, commercial businesses and private homes. It is a portable device used to destroy needles and lancets utilizing an electrical current which incinerates the lancet or syringes. It uses a rechargeable battery which delivers an electrical current to produce an arc of electricity directed at the tip of the syringe. This electrical arc disintegrates the needle and any residue is collected in a self-contained chamber in the device. The Company’s initial Sharps and Needle Destruction Device is referred to as the SANDD mini™. 
 
The SANDD mini™ aims to change both the way patients and physicians dispose of their needles and to eliminate the risk of needle stick injuries in the future.
 
Utilizing a plasma arc, the SANDD mini™ heats the needle to over 2500 degrees Celsius in less than three seconds, eliminating both the needle and all known pathogens in the process. The device uses a rechargeable battery to deliver the plasma arc to the needle. A fully charged battery will disintegrate 200 needles before needing to be recharged. The SANDD mini™ is designed to be used with hypodermic needles attached to prefilled syringes or diabetic pen injection devices that measure less than 1 inch in length and between 27-32 gauges in diameter. The device produces little to no waste leaving the syringe to be disposed of in general waste as opposed to the need for the use of a sharps box. The change in this route of waste disposal is projected to offer healthcare providers significant budgetary savings and ease of disposal in home healthcare settings. The SANDD mini™ has completed its field evaluation and is now being marketed by the Company.
 
In September 2018, RedHawk Medical Products, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired the world-wide exclusive manufacturing and distribution rights to certain intellectual properties which the Company believes, when re-engineered, will significantly expand the current market capabilities of its SANDD mini™ needle destruction unit. When re-engineering is complete, this new needle incineration technology (the “SANDD Pro™”) is projected to increase the Company’s needle incineration capabilities to include 14-gauge hypodermic needles and higher, up to 8” in length. Additionally, the re-engineered SANDD Pro™ technology is expected to feature a portable, rechargeable, battery operated unit. This portable unit (the “SANDD Pro Portable™”) on a single charge, is expected to incinerate needles 21-gauge and higher. We believe the SANDD Pro Portable™ is ideal for field use by first responders, home health care nurses, home use self-injectors and veterinarians. The Company believes the SANDD Pro™ and the SANDD Pro Portable™ will be available for sale by the end of the 2019 calendar year.


Branded Generic Pharmaceuticals.
 
Under the terms of the EcoGen Agreement, Scarlett and its affiliate agreed to surrender to the Company 10 million shares of RedHawk’s outstanding common stock, transfer to RedHawk Pharma approximately $300,000 of EcoGen’s preferred stock plus other consideration in exchange for RedHawk Pharma assuming approximately $370,000 of obligations due to EcoGen.

A generic drug is a pharmaceutical drug that is substantially equivalent to a brand name product in dosage, strength, route of administration, quality, performance and intended use. Although they may not be associated with a particular company, generic drugs are subject to government regulations in the countries where they are dispensed. A generic drug must contain the same active ingredients as the original brand name formulation. In most cases, generic drugs become available after the patent afforded to a drug’s original developer expires. Once generic drugs enter the market, competition often leads to substantially lower prices for both the brand name drug and its generic equivalents. Clinicians in the United Kingdom are encouraged to write prescriptions for patent protected drugs by their generic name in preparation for such drugs losing their patent protected status, with the prescribed drug being dispensed to the patient by a community pharmacy. Pharmacists are obligated by law to dispense the brand that is written, should the clinician not use the generic name when prescribing a particular treatment, with all drugs being dispensed against a set tariff pricing structure. The pharmacist therefore procures the generic drug at the lowest available price from the wholesale supply chain, who in turn procures the lowest priced drug from any available manufacturer, ensuring that the generic drug market in the United Kingdom is purely driven by cost. The legal obligation on United Kingdom pharmacists to dispense a branded product if that is so prescribed presents the opportunity for the branded generic strategy of EcoGen. With a portfolio of widely prescribed generic drugs listed as trademarked branded generics, EcoGen can offer significant budgetary savings when compared to standard generics by offering these branded generics for sale at a price below the listed generic tariff. With UK Commissioning Groups (“CCG’s) being driven to find savings across their budgets where possible, we believe EcoGen’s branded generic strategy has been met favorably. Currently, we hold licenses to manufacture and sell Paracetamol, Glipizide and Omeprazole.
 
Paracetamol – Paracetamol is a pain reliever and a fever reducer used to treat many conditions such as headache, muscle aches, arthritis, backache, toothaches, colds, and fever.
 
Glipizide – Glipizide is an oral diabetes medicine that helps control blood sugar levels by helping the pancreas produce insulin. Glipizide is used together with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control in adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
 
Omeprazole – Omeprazole is used to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach in order to treat gastric or duodenal ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), erosive esophagitis and hypersecretory conditions. Omeprazole is used to treat stomach infections caused by Helicobacter pylori bacteria.
 
We have sold our branded generic drugs to approximately five of the approximately 225 CCG’s through an exclusive distribution agreement with Alliance Healthcare. As we continue to develop our marketing strategy, expand our team of sales representatives and increase the line of pharmaceutical and medical device products offered to the CCG’s, we expect to capitalize on our distribution agreement with Alliance Healthcare.

Third Party Medical Device Distribution
 
In the future, we will only market products we own and manufacture. Until we adequately develop our product base, we will continue to offer for sale, certain medical devices owned by third parties. We will, however, periodically review the market acceptance of each third-party product being marketed by us and examine the profitability of each third-party marketing effort in comparison to the cost incurred in order to market that product. In the future, we may decide the market acceptance of a particular product is not adequate or profitability of marketing such product is unacceptable. As such, we may periodically add, revise, amend or discontinue various third-party distribution agreements.
 
Woundclot. On February 2, 2016, the Company announced that RedHawk Medical Products UK Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, had entered into a contract with Core Scientific Creations Ltd. for the distribution of WoundClot Surgical – Advanced Bleeding Control (“WoundClot”) in the United Kingdom. WoundClot, developed and manufactured in Israel by Core Scientific Creations Ltd, is the first UK Class III medical device, fully implantable surgical hemostat designed to stop moderate to severe arterial and venous hemorrhage without the need to compress directly onto the wound.
 
Hemostatic refers to a procedure, device or substance that arrests the flow of blood. Direct pressure, tourniquets and surgical clamps are mechanical hemostatic measures. Gelatin sponges, solutions of thrombin and microfibrillar collagen, which cause the aggregation of platelets and formation of clots, are used to arrest bleeding in surgical procedures. WoundClot is a single use sterile bio-absorb Hemostatic product made of non-oxidized cellulose, which can be fabricated into a variety of forms suitable in controlling bleeding from various kinds of wounds. WoundClot has been uniquely engineered and manufactured with a patented molecular structure, designed to entrap platelets and coagulants in a modified physical molecular matrix. We believe WoundClot is the first cellulose-based product to be manufactured using a non-oxidative process.
 
During 2016, the Company, in conjunction with EcoGen, began marketing the product to large teaching hospitals in the United Kingdom. While the product has been successfully trialed in various surgery disciplines including cardiothoracic, hepatobiliary, pediatric neurosurgery, vascular and trauma surgery and has been shown to outperform currently established products, market acceptance has been limited. We are also considering the introduction of WoundClot into other markets including the United States.

Real Estate
 
Tower Hotel Fund 2013, LLC. On December 31, 2015, RedHawk Land & Hospitality, LLC (“RedHawk Land”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired from Beechwood 280,000 Class A Units (approximately a 2.0% membership interest) in Tower Hotel Fund 2013, LLC, a real estate development limited liability company formed in Hawaii for acquisition, restoration and development of the Naniloa Hilo Resort in Hilo, Hawaii. The $625,000 purchase price was paid by the issuance of 625 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock. The purchase price was determined by an independent third-party valuation.


In September 2018, RedHawk Land received a cash payment of approximately $370,000 as a partial return on our investment. Pursuant to the terms of the limited liability operating agreement, the Company has offered to sell its membership interest in the Tower Hotel Fund 2013 to the remaining members in the Tower Hotel Fund 2013.
 










Other Real Estate. We own two properties as described below. In the past, we have marketed these properties, however, we are not actively marketing these properties at this time but may consider purchase offers as, and if, they occur.
 
In August 2017, we entered into a new triple-net lease agreement with the Louisiana 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals to renew and extend the current lease term of the Jefferson Street property to December 31, 2022.
 
The Company currently uses the Youngsville property as offices for our real estate management operations.
 
Specialized Security System Manufacturing and Distribution
 
Centri Controlled Entry System. On April 11, 2016, the Company acquired the exclusive United States manufacturing and distribution rights for the Centri Controlled Entry System (“Centri”), a nominal dose transmission x-ray full body scanner that is designed to be capable of finding weapons, drugs and other metallic and non-metallic contraband concealed on and within the human body. The Company acquired these exclusive rights from Basic Technologies, Inc. who holds the exclusive worldwide license to manufacture and sell Centri. In June 2016, the Company received approval from the FDA for the importation, assembly and demonstrations of Centri. Phase I radiation testing was successfully completed. Approval for human testing and the sale of Centri units was received from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality during the quarter ending September 30, 2016.
 
The Company is continuing to successfully test the safe operation of Centri and is currently working with the Louisiana State University Innovation Park to develop our marketing strategy to offer Centri for sale and/or lease as an alternative security system in various commercial applications.
 
Customers, Marketing and Contracting
 
Our medical devices and branded generics are to be marketed to a broad base of users, and we believe they are ideal for home and institutional use. The market for our devices and branded generics includes:

● | Retail Pharmacies 
--+------------------------------------------
● | Hospitals 
● | Physicians’ Offices 
● | Private and Public Healthcare Clinics 
● | Corrections Facilities 
● | Schools

Principal Suppliers and Sources of Raw Materials
 
Our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials, including electronic and mechanical components, batteries, carry bags, and molded plastic components and other supplies. We rely on third-party manufacturers to supply several components of our medical devices. We typically enter into supply agreements for these components that specify quantity, quality requirements, and delivery terms, which, in certain cases, can be terminated by either party upon relatively short notice. For each medical device, we have elected to source certain key components from single sources of supply, including our batteries and molded plastic components. While alternative sources of supply are readily available for these components, we believe that maintaining a single source of supply allows us to control production costs and inventory levels, and to manage component quality. In order to mitigate against the risks related to a single source of supply, we qualify alternative suppliers and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions. If any single-source supplier were no longer able to supply a component, we believe we would be able to promptly and cost-effectively switch to an alternative supplier without a significant disruption to our business and operations. We have adopted additional contingency plans to protect against an immediate disruption in supply of our battery components, and any potential delay that may result from a switch to a new supplier. These contingency plans include our own inventory management, along with a requirement that certain suppliers maintain specified quantities of inventory in multiple locations, as well as requiring certain manufacturers to maintain redundant manufacturing sites. We believe that these contingency plans would limit any disruption to our business in the event of an immediate termination of our battery supply.
Governmental Regulations
 
Our medical devices and generic pharmaceuticals are subject to a wide variety of stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations. We believe we have acquired all of the necessary permits and licenses necessary to manufacture, sell and safely distribute our products.
 
Medical Devices. Government authorities in the United States, Canada, and other countries in the Americas regulate the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices at the federal, state and local levels. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
In the United States, our needle incineration units and thermometers for human clinical use are classified as medical devices and require (i) an establishment license and (ii) depending on the class of device sought to be marketed, pre-market approval (PMA) or the less rigorous pre-market clearance.
 
Establishment License. Owners or operators of places of business (also called establishments or facilities) that are involved in both the production and distribution of medical devices intended for use in the United States (U.S.) are required to register annually with the FDA. This process is known as establishment registration. Most establishments that are required to register with the FDA are also required to list the devices that are made there and the activities that are performed on those devices. As a domestic distributor of certain medical devices in the United States, we will not be required to obtain an establishment license for those products, although the owner/operator of the products we distribute will be so required. Certain countries do not require an establishment license. Our needle destruction unit has an establishment license registered with the FDA.
 
Depending on the class designation of the device sought to be marketed, the owner/operator of the product must also obtain pre-market approval (PMA) or pre-market notification clearance before marketing in the U.S.
 
U.S. Medical Device Class Designations. The FDA has established classifications for different generic types of devices and grouped them into medical specialties. Each of these devices is assigned to one of three regulatory classes based on the level of control the FDA deems necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device.
 
Class I includes products of which several examples are already approved and marketed in Canada or the U.S. As long as the basic science remains the same, the application for approval of a new product is straightforward. Examples of products in this category include pregnancy tests or regular needles/syringes.
 
Class II products are those which are non-invasive, meaning they are not injected or inserted into the patient. Often these products are approved and sold throughout the world. The products which we are currently focusing on distributing all belong to Class II. In order to secure the necessary license for these products, we are required to submit all the documentation which led to the approval of the products in other countries. In our case, our products are already approved in Europe and Korea. We are required to submit to the FDA all the scientific data, results, approval process and certificates of good quality management, ISO 13485. Usually, products that have the ISO accreditation will satisfy FDA requirements.
 
Class III and IV include medical devices that use invasive techniques. If the medical device has been approved in another region, it is considered Class III. If it is new, it is considered Class IV. Invasive testing equipment such as colonoscopy, endoscopy, body lesion removal devices etc., are all considered Class III or IV. At this time, we do not manufacture or sell any Class III or Class IV medical devices.
 
Premarket Clearance. We focus our medical device distribution business on Class I and II medical devices. WoundClot and electronic clinical thermometers such as the Thermofinder are classified as Class II devices by the FDA are not subject to Premarket Approval (PMA). SANDD™ was originally classified by the FDA as a Class III medical device. In June 2018, the FDA amended the classification of needle destruction devices. Currently SANDD™ is now classified as a Class II medical device.
 
10

Each person who wants to market in the U.S., a Class I or II device intended for human use, for which a Premarket Approval (PMA) is not required, must submit a 510(k) application to the FDA unless the device is exempt from the Section 510(k) requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).
 
A 510(k) application is a pre-market submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device that is not subject to PMA. Submitters must compare their device to one or more similar legally marketed devices and make and support their substantial equivalency claims. A legally marketed device is a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, for which a PMA is not required, or a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device which has been found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The legally marketed device(s) to which equivalence is drawn is commonly known as the “predicate.” Although devices recently cleared under 510(k) are often selected as the predicate to which equivalence is claimed, any legally marketed device may be used as a predicate. Legally marketed also means that the predicate cannot be one that is in violation of the Act.
 
Before marketing a device, each submitter must receive an order, in the form of a letter, from the FDA which finds the device to be substantially equivalent and states that the device can be marketed in the U.S. This order “clears” the device for commercial distribution.
 
Until the submitter receives an order declaring a device substantially equivalent, the submitter may not proceed to market the device. Once the device is determined to be substantially equivalent, it can then be marketed in the U.S. The substantially equivalent determination is usually made within 90 days and is made based on the information submitted by the submitter.
 
Substantial Equivalence. A 510(k) clearance requires demonstration of substantial equivalence to another legally U.S. marketed device. Substantial equivalence means that the new device is at least as safe and effective as the predicate.
 
A device is substantially equivalent if, in comparison to a predicate it:
 

● | has the same intended use as the predicate; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------
● | has the same technological characteristics as the predicate;

 
or
 

● | has the same intended use as the predicate; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | has different technological characteristics and the information submitted to the FDA; 
● | does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness; and 
● | demonstrates that the device is at least as safe and effective as the legally marketed device.

 
A claim of substantial equivalence does not mean the new and predicate devices must be identical. Substantial equivalence is established with respect to intended use, design, energy used or delivered, materials, chemical composition, manufacturing process, performance, safety, effectiveness, labeling, biocompatibility, standards, and other characteristics, as applicable.
 
A device may not be marketed in the U.S. until the submitter receives a letter declaring the device substantially equivalent. If the FDA determines that a device is not substantially equivalent, the applicant may:
 

● | resubmit another 510(k) application with new data; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------
● | request a Class I or II designation through the de novo process;
● | file a reclassification petition; or 
● | submit a premarket approval application (PMA). 

Status of Medical Device Premarket Clearance. SANDD™ received its PMA in 2002. In 2014, HuBDIC Co. Ltd. made a 510(k) submission to the FDA and received pre-market clearance for the Thermofinder FS-700 and FS-700 Pro.
 
Future Business Opportunities. The Company’s board of directors is currently evaluating our future strategy for marketing all of our medical devices including SANDD mini™, SANDD Pro™, WoundClot and the Thermofinder FS-700 and FS-700 Pro non-contact thermometers. Under consideration is possibly contracting with third parties for the distribution of our medical devices to hospitals, doctors, schools, first responders, home health care providers, etc. The Company is considering engaging an independent marketing representative to offer its SANDD mini™, SANDD Pro™ and the consumer version of the digital non-contact thermometer, Thermofinder FS-700, through retail chains. No decision has yet been made on the future marketing strategies.

Insurance
 
Branded Generic Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices. Our operations and products are subject to inherent risks of personal safety and injury and, as such, we maintain insurance policies on the sale of our products to protect us in the event of a loss. Insurance coverage is provided for us by the owners of the products we distribute for third parties where we consider such coverage necessary.
 
We believe our insurance coverages for these risks are adequate. Historically, we have not experienced a loss in excess of our policy limits; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider to be commercially reasonable, nor can there be any assurance such coverage will be adequate to all of the claims that may arise.
 
Property and Casualty. We also maintain insurance against property damage, flood and other catastrophic events that may result in physical damage or destruction to our real estate. All policies are subject to deductibles and other coverage limitations. While we believe over coverage limits are adequate to protect against loss, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider to be commercially reasonable, nor can there be any assurance such coverage will be adequate to all of the claims that may arise.
Competition
 
The medical device and branded generic pharmaceutical distribution industries are highly competitive. We are a development stage company without established operations in our industry and have a weak competitive position. We aim to compete with junior and senior medical device and branded generic pharmaceutical manufacturers or distributors who are actively seeking to develop or acquire and sell devices competitive with our own. Competition for the medical device and branded generic pharmaceutical assets is intense and we may lack the technological information, human resources, infrastructure, expertise, and financial resources available to our competitors. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to develop our current assets, generate revenues, or obtain and develop future assets.
 
Many of the companies with which we aim to compete for financing and for the acquisition of medical device and branded generic pharmaceutical assets have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on assets of merit or on developing and distributing their own technologies.
 
General competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of regulation introduced from time to time by the governments of the United States and other countries, as well as factors beyond our control, including overall levels of supply and demand for the product types which we seek to distribute.
 
In the face of competition, we may not be successful in acquiring or successfully exploiting any distribution rights which we have acquired or may acquire in the future. Despite this, we hope to compete successfully in the medical device industry by:
 

● | maintaining low operating costs; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | relying on the strength of our management’s and future sales team’s contacts; 
● | utilizing our team’s previous product and sales and support experience in the specific device area; and 
● | using our size and experience to our advantage by adapting quickly to changing market conditions or responding swiftly to potential opportunities.

Employees
 
Currently, we do not have any employees. Our officers, and certain workers, are providing their services to us on an independent consultant basis, but, at this time, we have not entered into any employment agreements with them and the Consulting Agreement is our only written consulting arrangement. Our directors, executive officers and certain contracted individuals play an important role in the running of the Company. Currently we have only one officer, who received zero compensation from the Company during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, as described in more detail below in Item 11 of this Form 10-K. We do not expect any material changes in the number of employees over the next 12-month period. We intend to engage contractors from time to time to consult with us on specific corporate affairs or to perform specific tasks in connection with our anticipated sales and marketing programs.
Available Information
 
We are required to file our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the “SEC”) and our filings are available to the public at the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.
