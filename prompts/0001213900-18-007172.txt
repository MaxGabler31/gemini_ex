Recent Developments
 
The Company has a Market Partner Agreement with InsightPOS, LLC since September 17, 2016. InsightPOS is a “State of the Art”, “Super Functional Point Of Sale” system that has it a sleek, modern, efficient design and combination of tools that we believe makes the retail experience friendlier, quicker and better both for the shopper and for store management. InsightPOS will allow retailers to sell and manage their store’s inventory, with over 50 million SKUs already in the system and increase customer loyalty by offering important services and benefits. These additional services include, but are not limited to, long distance telecom products, cellular account payments (US and International), utility bill payments (electric, water, cable, satellite, etc.) and others. InsightPOS will provide the ability for each retail store to offer financial services, including gift cards, reloadable debit cards and potentially money transfer services, which will increase store revenue organically in a manner few have imagined possible. Insight POS can replace the entire cash register, inventory and management system.

The Company installed about 10 units including training by InsightPOS. These units were withdrawn due to required programming development and improved network interconnections. The revenues generated by system utilization should maintain the system at no cost to each retailer. NXGH will market major brand services along with its own branded services, GPR (General Purpose Reload) and reward cards.
 
The Company, through its affiliate, Next Communications, Inc., has the right to sell STI Mobile, Next Cala and any Next products to 8,800 locations that were serviced by a prepaid distribution network. The Company will offer the InsightPOS system to clients of this distribution network as well via direct sales through its own sales force and affiliates. When a system is installed, NGH receives 50% of the gross profits received by InsightPOS after retailer commissions are paid.

Next CALA
 
Our Next CALA subsidiary promotes and distributes NextCALA-branded Prepaid Visa® General Purpose Reloadable (“GPR”) prepaid debit cards, bearing the Next CALA Debit™ and Visa® logos. Customers may register for our prepaid debit card at http://www.nextcala.com. Each of our cards is issued by The Bancorp, MetaBank, Metropolitan Bank or Sutton Bank.
 
According to a Prepaid Card Market report published in March 2017 by Allied Market Research, the Prepaid Card Market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 22.7% from 2016 to 2022. The market accounted for $896 billion, and is expected to reach $3,653 billion by 2022. The base year considered for the study is 2015, and the forecast period is 2016-2022. Based on projections indicated by this report and other information, we believe that prepaid debit cards are one of the fastest growing niches in the financial sector. According to the 2015 FDIC National Survey, approximately nine million individuals in the U.S., including those in various minority communities, are unable to obtain access to the banking system due to various reasons, including but not limited to poor credit scores or a lack of exposure to the U.S. banking system. Prepaid debit cards are a convenient option for such individuals. Prepaid debit cards may also be an intermediate step toward such individuals ultimately joining the financial system. In addition, prepaid debit cards are a popular option for gift-giving due to fraud protection in the case of loss or theft. We believe that prepaid debit cards are replacing cash as a preferred gift for these reasons, in certain regards.
 
Card holders can upload funds onto their NextCALA prepaid cards via ACH wire transfer, online, or in person using Vanilla Reload machines, which are stationed in over 50,000 locations throughout the U.S., including but not limited to Walmart, CVS, Dollar General, Rite Aid and Walgreens retail stores, and anywhere in the Mio Reload Network, which includes more than 450,000 retail locations throughout the world. The card can be used like a traditional credit card or debit card and is accepted wherever Visa Debit® cards are accepted. Money spent using the card is deducted from the total balance of prepaid funds previously uploaded on the card. Unlike a credit card, prepaid debit card holders do not have the ability to spend more than the balance of prepaid funds previously uploaded on the card. Prepaid debit cards can be used and spent online and can be used at an ATM machine to retrieve cash.
 
Contractual Relationships with InComm, Bancorp, and Visa. Next CALA Prepaid Card® GPR cards are distributed and serviced by InComm Financial Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of InComm Holdings, Inc. (“InComm”). Next CALA has been indemnified by InComm, which possesses money transmitter licenses in all 50 states. InComm specifically also indemnifies Next CALA with respect to Anti Money Laundering and Know Your Client US banking regulations, as they capture and verify all of this as part of our agreement. In addition, The Bancorp Bank (“Bankcorp”), a member of the FDIC, pursuant to a license from Visa USA, Inc., acts as program manager and as clearing house and provides banking capacities in transactions involving the cards. Prepaid card deposits are held by Bankcorp, MetaBank, Metropolitan Bank or Sutton Bank.

InComm has granted NEXTCALA a complete white label of their back end prepaid, GIFTCARD, GPR, 210,000 US retailers with electronic and hard plastic stored value open and closed loop licenses, products and our very own brand along with licensing their MIO brand that is branded at every 210,000 InComm retailer and online footprint. In June 2017, NGH signed a Resale Agreement with InComm for the purchase and resale of prepaid and stored value products and services. Theterms with InComm, include the following:
 

● | InComm appointed NGH as an authorized reseller of InComm to promote, market and sell the Prepaid Items and Money Transmission Products and Services;

Next CALA’s new NEXTCALA Mobile Android and iOS apps should give users an easy way to check balances and account activity, make phone-to-phone payments, and send money to family, friends, and retailers.
 
Prepaid Card Solutions Democratize Banking and Payments. Prepaid cards democratize electronic payments and remittances for those outside the traditional banking system. The growing popularity of prepaid card solutions for both banked and unbanked consumers is driven by the prepaid card’s unique ability to solve almost any payment need.
 
Rapid Growth of the Mobile Banking Market. Based on projections by industry experts, the Company believes that prepaid debit cards are one of the fastest growing niches in the financial sector. The Prepaid Unbanked and underbanked segments of the USA, specifically the Latin demographic, is expanding rapidly and will reach approximately $421 billion in the United States and approximately $822 billion worldwide by 2017.
 
NEXTCALA Rewards. Through our Next CALA Rewards program, we are planning to offer benefits including allowing Next CALA subscribers to earn points for use in remittance transactions, or to be credited into reloadable international and domestic long distance calling cards for voice or HD video calls. During the second half of 2017, as Next CALA’s sibling company NxtGn, Inc. begins to roll out new products and services, the Next CALA Rewards program should also offer Next CALA subscribers the ability to use NxtGn’s proprietary HD Personal Telepresence products to participate in health care consultations, distance learning, and exclusive live entertainment events. The NEXTCALA Rewards platform is currently being developed and scheduled for release in the second half of 2018.
 
Advertising and Promotion. Next CALA is planning to increase its market presence and reach by aggressively advertising. CP & B is a 4% equity owner of NXGH and is scheduled to promote its products and services. In the initial phase of the launch campaign which will begin upon release of the NEXTCALA Mobile applications, Next CALA will use advertising to increase consumer awareness and stimulate trial of the NEXTCALA Mobile apps and Next CALA Prepaid Card® GPR cards during the second half of 2018.

While the primary venue for Next CALA’s launch campaign will be web-based media, the campaign will also include push promotions, web videos, bench, bus, and subway advertising, podcast advertising, and other disruptive measures designed to rapidly increase consumer awareness and trial of the NEXTCALA Mobile apps and Next CALA Prepaid Card® GPR cards in carefully selected target markets.

Next Mobile operates this business pursuant to contracts with Sprint Corporation which allow Next Mobile to use Sprint’s network infrastructure to operate a virtual telecommunications network providing voice, text, and data services of essentially the same quality as those Sprint provides to its own retail subscribers.
 

As customers worldwide continue to migrate away from legacy telephone and banking systems to enhanced mobility solutions, the Company’s technological advantage and the synergies created by its unique combination of reloadable bank card and mobile virtual network operator rights will make its products increasingly useful to un-banked, under-banked, under-served and other emerging niche markets.
 
Joint Venture. Because MVNO marketing is capital intensive, Next Mobile may sell a 50% interest in its MVNO rights to an operating partner who will be responsible for funding all future marketing expenses of the MVNO. The Company has been introduced to interested purchasers by Sprint, and believes it will be able to sell a 50% interest in the MVNO for $1.5 million in cash plus a commitment to fund all of the joint venture’s future marketing expenses.
