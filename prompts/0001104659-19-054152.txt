Item 1 and 2. Business and Properties
 
Samson Oil & Gas Limited (“we”, “Samson” or the “Company”) is a company limited by shares, incorporated on April 6, 1979, under the laws of Australia.  Our principal business is the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties in the United States. 
 
Recent activities
 
On April 9, 2019, Samson Oil and Gas, USA, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with AEP I FINCO LLC (“Lender”) providing for a $33.5 million term loan. The Company used the proceeds of the Credit Agreement to retire the Company’s previous credit facility of $23.9 million with Mutual of Omaha Bank, repay outstanding creditors, royalty and working interest owners and provide working capital to pursue its infill development drilling program. In conjunction with the closing of the Credit Agreement, the Company paid $1.4 million in deferred borrowing costs.
 
3


The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of the Company’s oil and gas properties and has a 5-year term with a maturity date on April 9, 2024. Interest on the Credit Facility accrues at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 10.5% and is payable on the last day of each interest period. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to certain covenants and obligations, as described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At June 30, 2019, we were in violation of certain financial covenants. We have, therefore, classified the total amount outstanding under our debt facility of $33.5 million as a current liability and fully amortized the $1.4 million of deferred borrowing costs as a charge to finance expense in our statement of operations.
 
The infill development drilling program is designed to drill horizontal laterals from the existing well bores. The ability to drill out of an existing wellbore has made the economics of these development wells attractive, given the ability to use surface facilities associated with the existing well. Over the next nine months, we expect to drill a total of eight lateral wells within the Home Run Field (the “Home Run Field Drill Program”), which is the largest (by area) of the oil fields in Samson’s portfolio. The Company has in its portfolio a total of 26 Contingent resource locations that management expects will provide an excellent growth platform. The Credit Agreement is expected to provide sufficient working capital to initiate and maintain the planned development drilling program. Due to our recent breaches of the Credit Agreement, however, the Lender may declare an event of default and foreclose on some or all of our assets and/or accelerate the full amount of the $33.5 million loan plus all accrued and unpaid interest, prepayment penalties, fees and other lender costs and expenses, depleting our working capital such that we would be unable to maintain the planned development drilling program.
 
Going concern
 
We do not generate adequate revenue to satisfy our current operations, we have negative cash flows from operations, and we have incurred significant net operating losses during the years ended June 30, 2019, and 2018, which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are also in breach of several of our covenants under the Credit Agreement, resulting in our borrowings payable of $33.5 million being classified as current liabilities.
 
Accordingly, our financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of normal business activities and the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. We are currently negotiating with a prospective party a transaction to divest all of our oil and gas assets, which we believe, if successful, will result in proceeds not less than our obligations under the Credit Agreement and to our vendors. We are also currently negotiating with the Lender in an effort to obtain a waiver for our breach of the Credit Agreement.
 
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our re-negotiation of the Credit Agreement, our ability to sell our assets, development of our Foreman Butte property, and our ability to reduce costs or raise further capital. There can be no assurances that we will successfully obtain a waiver from the Lender, successfully divest our assets, or increase our cash flows from operations. Given our current financial situation we may be forced to accept terms on these transactions that are less favorable than would be otherwise available.
 
Prior Transactions
 
In March 2016, we acquired the Foreman Butte Project, comprised of a number of producing and non-producing, operated and non-operated properties in the Ratcliffe and Madison formations in North Dakota and Montana. The purchase price was $16.0 million (before post-closing settlement adjustments) and following a review of the fair market value of the assets and liabilities on the closing date of the transaction, we recorded a bargain purchase gain of $10.7 million. This acquisition was financed through an extension in our credit facility with Mutual of Omaha Bank of $11.5 million and a $4.0 million promissory note provided to the seller of the assets. This note was repaid in May 2017 through a term note facility from Mutual of Omaha Bank.
 
On June 30, 2016, we signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of our North Stockyard project in North Dakota. The sale price was $15.0 million and closed on October 31, 2016, of which $11.5 million of the total proceeds from this transaction were used to pay down our credit facility with Mutual of Omaha Bank. The remaining proceeds were used to rebalance our hedge book, following the sale of a portion of our production, and for working capital.
 
In May 2017, we closed on the sale of our State GC assets in New Mexico. The sale price of $1.2 million was applied to pay down our facility with Mutual of Omaha Bank. In June 2017, Samson and Mutual of Omaha Bank agreed to extend both the $4 million term loan and our $19.5 million reserve base facility until October 2018. The previous maturity date was October 31, 2017.

In June 2018, we signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of the majority of our working interest in the Foreman Butte project in Montana and North Dakota for $40 million. This sale was expected to close on October 15, 2018 however the buyer failed to close. We terminated the purchase and sale agreement with the buyer and engaged PLS Energy Advisors Group to remarket the asset. A non-refundable $1 million deposit placed into escrow by the buyer was released to us.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to acquire, explore and develop oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids ("NGL's") in the United States, primarily with a focus in Montana and North Dakota. Our long-term strategy is to seek to deliver net asset value per share growth to our investors via attractive investments within the oil and gas industry. In the event we are able to obtain sufficient additional capital we expect to seek properties that offer profit potential from overlooked and by-passed reserves of oil and natural gas, which may include shut-in wells, in-field development, stripper wells, and re-completion and re-working projects.
Production and Reserves Estimates
 
Production Activities
 
Average net barrel of oil equivalent (“BOE”) production per day (“BOEPD”) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, was 629 BOEPD, an increase of 112 BOEPD or 21.5% compared to the same period in the prior year. Current 30 day production rate (as of August 31, 2019), is averaging 1,101 BOPD (on a gross Operated basis) and approximately 780 BOPD net to Samson. This increase is due to bringing wells back online through a series of workovers.

Reserve Analysis 
 
The Company’s estimated total net proved reserves of oil and natural gas as of June 30, 2019, and the present values of estimated future net revenues attributable to those reserves as of those dates, are presented in the following tables. All of our reserves are located in the United States. The estimates quoted for June 2019, are based on, and fairly represent, information and supporting documentation prepared by an employee of Netherland Sewell & Associates Inc, an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm. Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and its employees and its registered petroleum engineers have no interest in Samson and performed those services at their standard rates. Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc.’s estimates were based on a review of geologic, economic, ownership, and engineering data provided to them by us.
 
In accordance with SEC regulations, no price or cost escalation or reduction was considered. The technical persons at Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. responsible for preparing our reserve estimate meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
 
In substance, the Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. report used estimates of oil and gas reserves based upon standard petroleum engineering methods which include production data, decline curve analysis, volumetric calculations, pressure history, analogy, various correlations and technical factors. Information for this purpose was obtained from owners of interests in the areas involved, state regulatory agencies, commercial services, outside operators and files of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc.
 
Management has established, and is responsible for, internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the estimates of Proved Reserves are computed and reported in accordance with SEC rules and regulations as well as with established industry practices. Our officers, executives and geologists have experience evaluating reserves on a well by well basis and on a company wide basis. Prior to generation of the annual reserves, management and staff prepare an internal reserve study and then meet with Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. to review properties and discuss assumptions used in our internal study and the calculation of reserves. Management reviews all information submitted to Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. to ensure the accuracy of the data. Management also reviews the final report from Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and discusses any differences from Management expectations with them.
 
The reserve estimates are reported to the Board of Directors, at least annually. Our Board members have experience in reviewing and understanding reserve estimates.
 
The following tables summarize our proved oil and natural gas reserves at June 30, 2019, using SEC regulations and our contingent resources at June 30, 2019:
 

 | As at 30 June 2019 | 
---------+------------------------+------
Reserves | NET OIL MBBLS | | NET GAS MMCF | | NET BOE MBBLS | NPV 10 MILLION 
PDP | | 2,930 | | 915 | | 3,083 | $ | 47.6


Contingent Resources * | NET OIL MBBLS | | NET GAS MMCF | | NET BOE MBBLS | NPV 10 MILLION 
-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+----------------------+-------+-----------------------+------------------------
1C - Non-producing | | 102 | | 141 | | 126 | $ | 1.4 
1C - Undeveloped | | 2,682 | | 2,236 | | 3,055 | $ | 44.8
Total contingent resources | | 2,784 | | 2,377 | | 3,181 | $ | 46.2
Total proved plus contingent resources | | 5,714 | | 3,292 | | 6,264 | $ | 93.8

 
* Contingent Resources are potentially recoverable volumes associated with a development plan that targets discovered volumes but is not (yet) commercial, as defined below.

To be considered as “commercial”, there must be a firm intention to proceed with the project in a reasonable time frame (typically 5 years), and such intention must be based upon all of the following criteria:
 

· | A reasonable assessment of the future economics of the development project meeting defined investment and operating criteria; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A reasonable expectation that there will be a market for all or at least the expected sales quantities of production required to justify development; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Evidence that the necessary production and transportation facilities are available or can be made available; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Evidence that legal, contractual, environmental and other social and economic concerns will allow for the actual implementation of the recovery project being evaluated. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Given our current financial condition there is no assurance that we will have the necessary financial resources available to meet the defined investment and operating criteria, noted above, in order to execute the development plan necessary to categorize the Contingent resources as proven reserves.

The oil price after basis adjustments used in our June 30, 2019 reserve study for oil was $55.68 per Bbl and for natural gas was $3.89 per Mcf. The assumed prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenue attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect actual market prices for oil production sold after June 30, 2019. There can be no assurance that all of the estimated proved reserves will be produced and sold at the assumed prices. Accordingly, the foregoing prices should not be interpreted as a prediction of future prices.

Reporting and Financials
 
We became required to file our periodic reports to the SEC as a U.S. domestic issuer as of July 1, 2011. Since we remain an Australian corporation, however, we are still considered to be a domestic company in Australia as well.  As a result, we are required to report our financial results in the U.S. using U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and in Australia using International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
 
We publish our consolidated financial statements, both U.S. GAAP and IFRS, in U.S. dollars.  In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars, and references to “dollars,” “$” or “US$” are to United States dollars.  All references to “A$” are to Australian dollars.

Our principal office in the United States is located at 1331 17th Street, Suite 710, Denver, Colorado 80202 and our telephone number at that office is +1 303-295-0344. Our website is www.samsonoilandgas.com.
 
Marketing, Major Customers and Delivery Commitments
 
Markets for oil and natural gas are volatile and are subject to wide fluctuations depending on numerous factors beyond our control, including seasonality, economic conditions, foreign imports, political conditions in other energy producing countries, OPEC market actions, and domestic government regulations and policies. Substantially all of our production is sold pursuant to agreements with pricing based on prevailing commodity prices, subject to adjustment for regional differentials and similar factors. These contracts are generally set up on a month to month basis and can be cancelled at any time by either party giving 30 days’ notice. We had no material delivery commitments as of the date of this report.
Regulatory Environment
 
Our oil and gas exploration, production, and related operations are subject to numerous and frequently changing federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These regulations relate to, among other things, environmental and land-use matters, conservation, safety, pipeline use, drilling and spacing of wells, well stimulation, transportation, and forced pooling and protection of correlative rights among interest owners. Environmental laws and regulations may require the acquisition of certain permits prior to or in connection with our activities and operations. In addition, they may restrict or prohibit the types, quantities, and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment, including releases from drilling and production operations, and restrict or prohibit drilling or other operations that could impact wetlands, endangered or threatened species or other protected areas or natural resources. Following is a summary of some key statutory and regulatory programs that affect our operations.
 
Regulation of Oil and Gas
 
Certain regulations may govern the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the rates of production or “allowables,” the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, and the notification of surface owners and other third parties. Certain laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. We also are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to Native American tribal surface ownership, Native American oil and gas leases and other exploration agreements, fees, taxes, or other burdens, obligations, and issues unique to oil and gas ownership and operations within Native American reservations.
 
Environmental and Land Use Regulation
 
A wide variety of environmental and land-use regulations apply to companies engaged in the production and sale of oil and natural gas. These regulations have been changed frequently in the past and, in general, these changes have imposed more stringent requirements that increase operating costs and/or require capital expenditures to remain in compliance. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil and/or criminal penalties and liability for non-compliance, clean-up costs and other environmental and natural resource damages. It also is possible that unanticipated developments or changes in the law could require us to make environmental expenditures significantly greater than those we currently expect.
Discharges to Waters. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended (the “Clean Water Act”), and comparable state statutes impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of “pollutants,” which include dredge and fill material, produced waters, various oil and natural gas wastes, including drilling fluids, drill cuttings, and other substances. Discharge of such pollutants into wetlands, onshore (streams, rivers, etc.), coastal and offshore waters without appropriate permits is prohibited. These controls generally have become more stringent over time, and it is possible that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future. Violation of the Clean Water Act and similar state regulatory programs can result in civil, criminal and administrative penalties for the unauthorized discharges of pollutants. Violations also put operators at risk of citizen lawsuits under the Clean Water Act, seeking both enforcement of the Clean Water Act’s provisions and civil penalties and litigation costs. Operators may also face substantial liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with improper discharges of pollutants.

The Clean Water Act also regulates stormwater discharges from industrial properties and construction sites, and requires permits and the implementation of site-specific Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans (“SWPPPs”), best management practices, training, and periodic monitoring of covered activities. Certain operations also are required to develop and implement Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (“SPCC”) plans, and in some circumstances, facility response plans to address potential oil and produced water spills. Certain exemptions from some Clean Water Act requirements were created or broadened pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
 
The Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”) of 1990 places strict liability for oil spills on the "responsible party," which it defines for onshore facilities as the owner or operator of a facility or pipeline. Strict liability means liability without fault. The OPA provides for the recovery of cleanup and removal costs, and also recognizes as recoverable damages the loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity due to the injury to natural resources caused by an oil spill. Further, a federal, state, foreign government, or Indian tribe trustee may recover damages for injury to natural resources, including the reasonable cost of assessing the damage. Finally, federal and state governments may also recover damages for the loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees, or profits brought about by injury to property or natural resources. We may be subject to strict liability under OPA for all or part of the costs of cleaning up oil spills from our facilities and for natural resource damages. We have not, to our knowledge, been identified as a responsible party under OPA, nor are we aware of any prior owners or operators of our properties that have been so identified with respect to their operation of those properties.
 
Safe Drinking Water Act – Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or the “SDWA”, is the main federal law that authorizes the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to set standards for drinking water quality and oversee the states, localities, and water suppliers who implement those standards. The Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program under the SDWA is responsible for regulating the construction, operation, permitting, and closure of injection wells that place fluids underground. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 currently excludes hydraulic fracturing from regulation by the SDWA. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that creates a fracture extending from a well bore into a low-permeability rock formation to enable oil or natural gas to move more easily to a production well. Hydraulic fractures typically are created through the injection of water, sand and chemicals into the rock formation.
 
The United States Congress has on multiple occasions considered, and may in the future consider, legislation such as the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, or the FRAC Act, to amend the SDWA to repeal this exemption. However, Congress has not taken any significant action on such legislation. A version of the FRAC Act was introduced in 2017 but remains in the first stages of the legislative process. If enacted as currently proposed, the FRAC Act would amend the definition of “underground injection” in the SDWA to encompass hydraulic fracturing activities. Such a provision could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, including disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. The FRAC Act’s proposal to require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. It is not possible to predict whether a future session of Congress may act further on hydraulic fracturing legislation. Such legislation, if adopted, could establish additional regulation and permitting requirements at the federal level.
 
In addition, in March 2010, at the request of the U.S. Congress, EPA announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water resources. A progress report was released in December 2012. In May 2014, the EPA indicated that as a first step, it would convene a stakeholder process to develop an approach to obtain information on chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. To gather information to inform EPA's proposal, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) and initiated a public participation process to seek comment on the information that should be reported or disclosed for hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures and the mechanism for obtaining this information. EPA issued a draft report in June 2015, concluding that, although hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources through water withdrawals, spills, fracturing directly into such resources, underground migration of liquids and gases, and inadequate treatment and discharge of wastewater, EPA did not find evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States. EPA finalized the report in December 2016, after considering public comments on the draft report. The key findings remain largely unchanged from the draft report, although EPA noted in the final report that data gaps and uncertainties limited EPA’s ability to fully assess the potential impacts on drinking water resources locally and nationally.

Hydraulic fracturing currently is regulated primarily at the state level. Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, Texas, and New Mexico recently enacted rules to regulate certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These regulations generally require companies to disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations, as well as the concentrations of those chemicals, on a well-by-well basis, either prior to or following well completion, depending on which state’s regulations apply.
 
Air Emissions.  Our operations are subject to local, state and federal regulations governing emissions of air pollutants. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally based permitting requirements. Producing wells, natural gas plants and electric generating facilities all emit volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and nitrous oxides in their normal operation.  Civil and administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits generally are resolved by payment of monetary fines, performance of mitigation projects to offset excess emissions and the correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could require us to forego construction, modification or operation of certain sources of emissions.
 
In April 2012, EPA issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that among other things, requires operators to capture 95 percent of the VOC emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured. The reduction in VOC emissions is accomplished primarily through the use of “reduced emissions completion” methods to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air or be combusted. EPA also issued regulations that set requirements for VOC emissions from several types of equipment, including storage tanks, compressors, dehydrators, valves and connectors. In June 2016, EPA issued additional regulations specific to the oil and gas industry adding methane standards for equipment and processes covered by the 2012 regulations.  The 2016 final regulations also add leak detection and repair (LDAR) requirements for equipment such as valves, connectors, pressure relief valves, open-ended lines, access doors, flanges, crank case vents, pump seals or diaphragms, closed vent systems, compressors, separators, dehydrators, thief hatches on storage tanks, and sweetening units at gas processing plants. On April 19, 2017, EPA announced its intent to administratively reconsider the methane rules, staying a June 3, 2017 effective date for certain provisions—such as the LDAR provisions—for 90 days. Environmental groups filed a petition to stop the administrative stay in the D.C. Circuit, and on July 3, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted relief for the petitioners, which had the impact of making the previously-stayed rules effective. And on September 12, 2018, EPA proposed revisions to its 2016 methane regulations and sought comment on additional areas for possible revision as part of its previously noted reconsideration of those rules. While EPA continues to reconsider aspects of the methane rule, it will remain effective.  These new and revised regulations, or the adoption of any other laws or regulations restricting or reducing these emissions, will increase our operating costs.
 
Another regulatory development that may impact our operations is EPA’s notice of finding and determination that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to human health and the environment.  In response to that finding, EPA has implemented GHG-related reporting, monitoring, and recordkeeping rules for petroleum and natural gas systems, among other industries, and developed a Climate Action Plan, including a Methane Strategy which formed the basis for methane regulations issued in June 2016. However, the Executive Office report calling for the Climate Action Plan and Methane Strategy was rescinded by President Donald Trump by Executive Order 13,783, and the June 2016 methane regulations, though currently effective, are the subject of proposed and possible further reconsideration and revision, as noted above. EPA has also solicited comment on a proposed two-year stay of those methane rules. Those methane regulations remain in effect until possible revision or repeal by separate EPA rulemaking in the future, which action is also likely to be challenged in the courts. While the U.S. Congress has considered, and may in the future again consider, “cap and trade” legislation that would establish an economy-wide cap on emissions of GHGs in the United States and could require major sources of GHG emissions to obtain GHG emission “allowances” to continue their operations, the current administration’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate accords, announced on June 1, 2017, among other factors, makes passage of such legislation less likely in the near term. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs would be likely to increase our operating costs and could also have an adverse effect on demand for our production.
 
Waste Disposal. We currently own or lease a number of properties that have been used for production of oil and natural gas for many years. Although we believe the prior owners and/or operators of those properties generally utilized operating and disposal practices that met applicable standards in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties we currently own or lease. State and federal laws applicable to oil and natural gas wastes have become more stringent over time. Under new and existing laws, we could be required to remediate property, including groundwater, containing or impacted by previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or to perform remedial well-plugging operations to prevent future, or mitigate existing, contamination.
 
10


We may generate wastes, including “solid” wastes and “hazardous” wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, although certain oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) wastes currently are excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. On May 4, 2016, several environmental groups filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court for the District of Columbia seeking to compel the EPA to review the exemption of E&P wastes under RCRA. The groups had previously filed a Notice of Intent (“NOI”) to Sue EPA in August 2015 for failure to act on a 2010 petition to review the E&P RCRA exemption. In late December 2016, EPA entered into a consent decree with the environmental groups and agreed to reconsider the Agency’s current treatment of E&P wastes. The District Court approved the consent decree, binding EPA to a court-imposed timeline for determining how oil and gas wastes should be regulated under RCRA. In April 2019, EPA concluded that it would not revise federal regulations on E&P waste management under the RCPA at this time. This decision received criticism from environmental groups and both the federal government and state governments will likely continue to receive pressure to further regulate E&P waste. If E&P waste becomes regulated as hazardous waste, then generators, transporters, and owners/operators of disposal and treatment facilities will be subject to RCRA regulations at significant increased cost. Thus, it is possible that certain wastes generated by our oil and natural gas operations that currently are excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes, and may therefore become subject to more rigorous and costly management, disposal and clean-up requirements. State and federal oil and natural gas regulations also provide guidelines for the storage and disposal of solid wastes resulting from the production of oil and natural gas, both onshore and offshore.
 
Superfund. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and similar state laws, responsibility for the entire cost of cleaning up a contaminated site, as well as natural resource damages, can be imposed upon current or former site owners or operators and any party who releases or threatens to release one or more designated “hazardous substances” at the site, regardless of whether the original activities that led to the contamination were lawful at the time of disposal. This is known as strict liability, meaning liability without fault. CERCLA also authorizes EPA and, in some cases, third parties, to take actions in response to releases of hazardous substances into the environment and to seek to recover from the potentially responsible parties the costs of such response actions. Although CERCLA generally excludes petroleum from the definition of hazardous substances, in the course of our operations we may have generated and may generate other wastes that fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. We also may be an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been released by previous owners or operators. We may be subject to joint and several liability as well as strict liability under CERCLA for all or part of the costs of cleaning up facilities at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages. Joint and several liability is liability that may be apportioned either among two or more parties or to only one or a few select members of a group, making each party individually responsible for the entire obligation. In some situations, we could be exposed to liability for clean-up costs and other damages as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of third parties at, or prior operators of, properties we have acquired. This includes, in some circumstances, operators of properties in which we have an interest and parties that provide transportation services for us. If exposed to joint and several liability, we could be responsible for more than our share of costs for remediating a particular site, and potentially for the entire obligation, even where other parties were involved in the activity giving rise to the liability. We have not, to our knowledge, been identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA, nor are we aware of any prior owners or operators of our properties that have been so identified with respect to their ownership or operation of those properties.
BLM Venting and Flaring Proposed Rule. On January 22, 2016 the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) released a proposed BLM Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation proposed rule. Comment on the proposed rule closed on April 22, 2016, and BLM issued its final rule on November 18, 2016. Petitions for judicial review of the rule were filed by industry groups and, as a result, BLM postponed compliance dates for certain sections of the rule pending judicial review. The 2016 rule was designed to replace the BLM's notice to lessees, NTL-4A, on venting and flaring at oil and gas facilities producing on federal and tribal lands by dealing with provisions related to venting and flaring of oil and natural gas, leak detection, storage tanks, pneumatic controllers and pumps, well maintenance and unloading, drilling and completions, and royalties. On September 18, 2018, however, the BLM substantially revised its 2016 Waste Prevention Rule, which had also been the subject of multiple court challenges but had become effective at certain points in the interim due to various court rulings. The 2018 rule essentially reverts the agency’s regulation of venting and flaring to what existed before the 2016 Waste Prevention Rule was promulgated.
Potentially Material Costs Associated with Environmental Regulation of Our Oil and Natural Gas Operations
 
Significant potential costs relating to environmental and land-use regulations associated with our existing properties and operations include those relating to: (i) plugging and abandonment of facilities; (ii) clean-up costs and damages due to spills or other releases; and (iii) penalties imposed for spills, releases or non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we typically have contractually assumed, and may assume in the future, obligations relating to plugging and abandonment, clean-up and other environmental costs in connection with our acquisition of operating interests in fields, and these costs can be significant.

Plugging and Abandonment Costs
 
Our operations are subject to stringent abandonment and closure requirements imposed by the various regulatory bodies including the BLM and State agencies.
 
As described in our financial statements, we have estimated the present value of our aggregate asset retirement obligations to be $3.6 million as of June 30, 2019. This figure reflects the expected future costs associated with site reclamation, facilities dismantlement and plugging and abandonment of wells. The discount rates used to calculate the present value varied depending on the estimated timing of the obligation, but typically ranged between 4% and 13 %. Actual costs may differ from our estimates. Our financial statements do not reflect any liabilities relating to other environmental obligations.
Competition
 
The oil and natural gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of additional reserves and in the sale of oil and natural gas. Our competitors consist of major and intermediate sized integrated oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and operators. The principal competitive factors in the acquisition of undeveloped oil and gas leases include the availability and quality of staff and data necessary to identify, investigate and purchase such leases, and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such leases. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, and more fully developed staffs and facilities than ours. In addition, the producing, processing and marketing of natural gas and crude oil are affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, the effect of which cannot be accurately predicted. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Ultimately, our future success will depend on our ability to develop or acquire additional reserves at costs that allow us to remain competitive.
Employees
 
At October 15, 2019, we had 5 full-time employees in Denver, Colorado, U.S.
