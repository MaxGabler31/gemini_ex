 Overview
 We are a late‑stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of human therapeutics using our proprietary PRINT® technology to transform the lives of patients. PRINT is a particle engineering platform that enables precise production of uniform drug particles designed to improve the safety, efficacy and performance of a wide range of therapies. We are currently focused on the development of two product candidates for which we hold worldwide commercial rights: LIQ861 for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, and LIQ865 for the treatment of local post‑operative pain. Our lead product candidate, LIQ861, is being evaluated in an open‑label Phase 3 clinical trial. LIQ861 is an inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil designed to improve the therapeutic profile of treprostinil by enhancing deep‑lung delivery and achieving higher dose levels than current inhaled therapies. We have applied our PRINT technology to enable us to deliver LIQ861 through a convenient, disposable dry powder inhaler, or DPI. We have also applied our PRINT technology to our second product candidate, LIQ865, for which we have completed two Phase 1 clinical trials. LIQ865 is designed to deliver sustained‑release particles of bupivacaine, a non‑opioid anesthetic, to treat local post‑operative pain for three to five days through a single administration.
 Our lead product candidate, LIQ861, is being evaluated for the treatment of PAH, a chronic, progressive disease caused by the hardening and narrowing of the pulmonary arteries that can lead to right heart failure and eventually death. Treprostinil is a synthetic analog of prostacyclin, a vasoactive mediator essential to normal lung function that is deficient in patients with PAH. PAH is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence in the United States expected to be approximately 30,000 patients by 2020. Decision Resources Group, an independent industry research firm, estimated that in 2017 products containing treprostinil across its three routes of administration (oral, inhaled and parenteral infusion) generated revenue that represented about one‑quarter of the approximately $3.7 billion U.S. market for PAH drug therapies. The inhaled route of administration, in which medication is inhaled directly into the lungs, helps minimize the off‑tissue adverse side effects of systemic delivery by delivering the drug directly where it is needed. Tyvaso® (treprostinil, inhaled solution), marketed by United Therapeutics in the United States, is the standard of care among the inhaled therapies, with more than 80% of inhaled prostacyclin sales in the United States. Current inhaled therapies, including Tyvaso, are delivered by a nebulizer, a device that converts a liquid formulation into mist, and require between four and nine doses per day. Nebulizers require regular care and maintenance, including daily cleaning and access to additional parts and supplies, such as distilled water and a power source, all of which compromise the portability of the device and the quality of life of patients.

We believe LIQ861, if approved, will be the first-to-market inhaled dry powder treprostinil that can be delivered using a convenient, palm-sized, disposable DPI. We believe LIQ861 can overcome the limitations of current inhaled therapies and has the potential to maximize the therapeutic benefits of treprostinil in treating PAH by safely delivering higher doses into the lungs. Based on our in vitro studies we believe that the precise size, trefoil-like shape and uniformity of each LIQ861 particle may provide deep-lung delivery of treprostinil and may reduce deposition in the upper airway where irritation and pain have been observed with nebulized treprostinil. In March 2017, we completed a Phase 1 trial of LIQ861 in 57 healthy volunteers in which LIQ861 was well-tolerated at all doses tested up to 150 mcg (treprostinil capsule strength or capsule treprostinil fill weight), which we estimate is equivalent to approximately twice the maximum recommended dosage of Tyvaso, and showed a proportional dose-response in pharmacokinetics. We estimate that the capsule strength of 75 mcg of LIQ861, delivered in one to two breaths, is approximately equivalent to the 

 
  2

 
maximum recommended dosage of Tyvaso (54 mcg, delivered in nine breaths). After consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, we advanced from this Phase 1 trial into our current pivotal Phase 3 trial, known as INSPIRE, or Investigation of the Safety and Pharmacology of Dry Powder Inhalation of Treprostinil. We will seek approval of LIQ861 under the 505(b)(2) pathway, which would allow us to rely in part on the FDA’s previous findings of efficacy and safety of Tyvaso and the active ingredient treprostinil, which has been approved in four different products administered through the continuous infusion (parenteral), inhaled and oral routes. In January 2018, we announced the initiation of INSPIRE evaluating LIQ861 for the treatment of PAH in the United States. If approved, we believe LIQ861 will have the potential to increase the number of patients using the inhaled route of treatment for PAH by providing the benefits of inhaled prostacyclin therapy earlier in a patient’s disease progression as well as delaying the burden of starting continuously infused products. As reported on January 7, 2019, we enrolled 109 patients in our INSPIRE trial, completing enrollment for the safety portion of the trial. LIQ861 was observed to be well-tolerated at the two-week timepoint. The safety data at the two-week timepoint addresses the FDA’s request for inclusion of such data in an NDA submission. During this two-week time period, LIQ861 was evaluated at capsule strengths up to 125 mcg treprostinil with no study-drug related serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities observed. The INSPIRE study is designed to evaluate patients who have either been under stable treatment with nebulizer-delivered treprostinil for at least three months and are transitioned to LIQ861 under the protocol or who have been under stable treatment with no more than two non-prostacyclin oral PAH therapies for at least three months and have their treatment regimen supplemented with LIQ861 under the protocol. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of LIQ861. We are currently focusing our efforts on completing patient enrollment in our one-directional crossover sub-study of at least 18 patients to compare bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of treprostinil as the patients transition from Tyvaso to LIQ861. After review of an initial cohort of patients in our open-label INSPIRE trial we amended the INSPIRE protocol to adjust pharmacokinetic sub-study dosing levels of LIQ861 to more closely match Tyvaso dosing levels on an emitted dose basis. We expect to report pharmacokinetics results in the second quarter of 2019. We intend to conduct additional clinical work in support of our marketing and commercial activities in advance of our U.S. launch for LIQ861, including maintaining patients on LIQ861 up to our U.S. launch and collecting data relating to the effects of LIQ861 on hemodynamic measurements. We are targeting a New Drug Application, or NDA, submission to the FDA for LIQ861 in late 2019 which submission will include the two-week safety data, the available two-month safety and tolerability data and our bioavailability and pharmacokinetics results. We expect the NDA to also include additional data generated from our clinical studies on LIQ861 and any further safety data available at that time.
 Our second product candidate, LIQ865, is an injectable, sustained‑release formulation of bupivacaine for the management of local post‑operative pain for three to five days after a procedure. We believe LIQ865, if approved, has the potential to provide significantly longer local post‑operative pain relief compared to currently marketed formulations of bupivacaine. We estimate that there were over 40 million surgeries in our target market, which consists of orthopedic and soft tissue surgeries, performed in the United States in 2016. According to IMS Health, an independent market research firm, the global market for local anesthetics was approximately $761.1 million in 2017. Despite current pain‑management protocols, post‑operative pain is still undermanaged, with studies showing that approximately 50% of patients self‑report inadequate pain relief. Post‑operative pain management is becoming more important as surgeries increase in volume and complexity and hospitals seek treatments that support faster recovery and time to discharge. Concurrently, the risk of opioid abuse and diversion has led physicians, payors and the U.S. federal government to prioritize pain management strategies that minimize reliance on opioids. Local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, provide a well‑established, non‑opioid option for post‑operative pain management, but their duration of efficacy has been limited to eight hours or less. The FDA has approved one long‑acting local anesthetic, liposomal bupivacaine, but pain relief typically lasts only 24 to 36 hours, according to physicians, and its use in combination with other local anesthetics can result in an unsafe release of drug. In LIQ865, we have engineered the size and composition of the LIQ865 PRINT particles to release bupivacaine over three to five days through a single administration. We completed a Phase 1a clinical trial of LIQ865 in Denmark and a Phase 1b clinical trial in the United States. We commenced preparation for Phase 2‑enabling toxicology studies in the fourth quarter of 2018 and expect to initiate these studies in the first quarter of 2019, complete these initial studies by the end of 2019 and commence initial Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trials in 2020.
 Both LIQ861 and LIQ865 are being developed using our proprietary PRINT particle engineering technology, which allows us to engineer and manufacture highly uniform drug particles with independent control over their size, three‑dimensional geometric shape and chemical composition. By controlling these physical and chemical parameters of 

 
  3

 
particles, PRINT enables us to target and design desirable pharmacological benefits into product candidates, including prolonged duration of drug release, increased drug loading, a more convenient method of administration, novel combination products, enhanced storage and stability and the potential to reduce adverse side effects. We have scaled PRINT manufacturing to meet the demands of clinical development and, we believe, commercial production. Our approach enables us to design and produce custom micro‑ and nano‑particles containing existing or new small molecule drugs or biologics. For example, we have engineered LIQ861 so that each particle has an ideal aerodynamic size and shape for deep‑lung delivery. Our PRINT particle engineering technology also allows us to design the chemical composition of particles to control drug release ranging from minutes, days, weeks or months as needed to meet a target profile, such as LIQ865’s three to five day release of bupivacaine.
 Initially, our internal pipeline is focused on the development of improved and differentiated drug products containing FDA‑approved active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, with established efficacy and safety profiles, which we believe are eligible for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to seek marketing approval in the United States. The 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway can be capital efficient and potentially enable a shorter time to approval. We intend to seek marketing approval in the United States for LIQ861 and LIQ865 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which would allow us to rely in part on existing knowledge of the safety and efficacy of the reference listed drugs. The FDA has indicated that it considers LIQ861, which is delivered by a DPI, to be a drug‑device combination product and, accordingly, the DPI will be evaluated as part of our NDA filing.
 In addition to building our own internal pipeline, we have collaborated, and may consider collaborating, with pharmaceutical companies to develop their own product candidates, leveraging our PRINT technology across a wide range of therapeutic areas, molecule types and routes of administration. Through our collaboration arrangement with GlaxoSmithKline plc and its subsidiaries, collectively, GSK, we have applied PRINT technology to novel molecules. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the United States by establishing our own sales force and commercial infrastructure. Outside of the United States, we intend to pursue the regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates with pharmaceutical companies with regional expertise. We intend to manufacture our product candidates using in‑house capabilities. Where appropriate, we will rely on contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce, package and distribute our approved drug products on a commercial scale.

 Product Pipeline
 The following table summarizes our clinical‑stage product candidates being developed using PRINT technology.

 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to develop and commercialize medicines with improved and differentiated product profiles based on our PRINT particle engineering technology. To achieve this goal, we intend to execute the following key elements of our business strategy:
· | Complete the NDA submission for our lead product candidate, LIQ861, in PAH. We initiated INSPIRE, an open-label Phase 3 trial, in patients with PAH and we have completed enrollment for the safety portion of the trial. We are currently focusing our efforts on completing patient enrollment in our one-directional crossover sub-study of at least 18 patients to compare bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of treprostinil as the patients transition from Tyvaso to LIQ861. We believe, based on feedback from the FDA, that this clinical trial will support the NDA filing for our novel inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil to treat PAH. We reported positive interim two-week safety data in January 2019, and expect to report pharmacokinetics results in the second quarter of 2019. We intend to conduct additional clinical work in support of our marketing and commercial activities in advance of our U.S. launch for LIQ861, including maintaining patients on LIQ861 up to our U.S. launch and collecting data relating to the effects of LIQ861 on hemodynamic measurements. We are targeting an NDA submission to the FDA for LIQ861 in late 2019 which submission will include the two-week safety data, the available two-month safety and tolerability data and our bioavailability and pharmacokinetics results. We expect the NDA to also include additional data generated from our clinical studies on LIQ861 and any further safety data available at that time.

· | Advance our local post‑operative pain product candidate, LIQ865, through Phase 2‑enabling toxicology studies into Phase 2 clinical trials. We completed a Phase 1a clinical trial of LIQ865, our novel long‑acting formulation of bupivacaine, in Denmark in March 2017, and a Phase 1b clinical trial in the United States in April 2018. We commenced preparation for Phase 2‑enabling toxicology studies in the fourth quarter of 2018 and expect to initiate these initial studies in the first quarter of 2019. We anticipate that the initial Phase 2‑enabling toxicology studies will result in LIQ865 being Phase 2‑ready by the end of 2019, we will complete these studies by the end of 2019 and that we will commence initial Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trials in 2020.

the United States by establishing targeted sales and marketing teams. After reviewing the results of all of our Phase 2‑enabling toxicology studies for LIQ865, and subject to the availability of sufficient funding, we will develop and commercialize LIQ865 independently, if it is ultimately approved, or seek to license this product candidate to one or more third parties. Outside of the United States, we intend to pursue the regulatory approval and commercialization of LIQ861 and LIQ865 with pharmaceutical companies with regional expertise.

· | Expand our internal pipeline leveraging our PRINT technology. We intend to continue targeting diseases where we believe our PRINT technology can improve the efficacy, safety and patient experience of current treatments that have been impaired by suboptimal drug product formulation and delivery. We plan to focus initially on the development of improved and differentiated drug products containing FDA‑approved APIs with proven efficacy and safety profiles eligible to use the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. In addition, we may expand our clinical development of LIQ861 and LIQ865, where appropriate, into broader indications or new applications.

· | Pursue strategic collaborations to maximize the value of products enabled by PRINT technology. In addition to advancing our own internal product candidates, we have collaborated, and may consider collaborating, with pharmaceutical companies to develop their own product candidates across a wide range of therapeutic areas, molecule types and routes of administration, leveraging our PRINT technology. We believe that collaborating with pharmaceutical companies helps advance new PRINT capabilities, while adding to our intellectual property portfolio.

  Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that we have several key strengths that have contributed to the development of our business and that will help us to realize our goal of becoming a biopharmaceutical company across research, development and commercialization activities. Our competitive strengths include:
· | Our PRINT technology gives us the capability to overcome the constraints of conventional formulation and production methods and can be applied broadly across therapeutic areas, molecule types and routes of administration. Our PRINT technology allows us to precisely engineer drug particles in a wide variety of compositions, sizes and shapes and achieve a high level of control over the physical and chemical characteristics of drug particles, as compared to conventional formulation and production methods. PRINT particles can be designed to address specific pharmacological or therapeutic objectives, such as enhancing the route of administration, improving solubility, enhancing stability or extending therapeutic effects. Using our PRINT technology, we are able to engineer, among others, small molecule and biologic particles, single agent drug and combination drug particles and vaccine particles to improve efficacy, safety and convenience for patients. Our internal pipeline strategy is currently focused on developing proprietary innovations to currently approved drug products in order to minimize development risks and increase speed to market. In particular, we have designed LIQ861 to maximize the therapeutic benefits of treprostinil in treating PAH by safely delivering higher doses into the lungs using a convenient, palm‑sized, disposable DPI. We believe that this may lead to a more attractive product profile with a more convenient method of administering the drug, as compared to the existing inhaled therapies that are currently available. We have also designed LIQ865 with the intention of providing patients with local post‑operative analgesia for three to five days. We believe this would provide a longer period of pain relief than the existing local‑acting pain drugs that are available, which could be a positive feature in light of interest in reducing the patient’s reliance on opioids and non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, for local post‑operative pain management.

· | We have scaled operations with rapid and cost‑effective transition to clinical development and commercial production. We believe our research and development operations and PRINT technology allow us to transition rapidly and cost‑effectively from laboratory to clinical development and ultimately commercial‑scale manufacture of drug particles. Utilizing well‑established techniques from other roll‑to‑roll manufacturing processes, we have scaled PRINT technology to support the quality and quantity needs for clinical and, we believe, commercial production of our product candidates. The physical equipment for the PRINT technology requires a relatively small footprint, low capital investment and minimal operating costs. We believe our manufacturing facilities comply with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements.

  Our Product Candidates
 LIQ861
 Our lead product candidate, LIQ861, is an inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil designed using our PRINT technology to enhance deep‑lung delivery using a convenient DPI for the treatment of PAH. We believe LIQ861 can overcome the limitations of current inhaled therapies and has the potential to maximize the therapeutic benefits of treprostinil in treating PAH by safely delivering higher doses into the lungs. If approved, we believe LIQ861 will have the potential to increase the number of patients using the inhaled route of treatment for PAH by providing the benefits of

inhaled prostacyclin therapy earlier in a patient’s disease progression as well as delaying the burden of starting continuously infused products.
 Background on PAH
 PAH is a chronic, progressive disease caused by the hardening and narrowing of pulmonary arteries that can lead to right heart failure and eventually death. Prostacyclin is a vasoactive mediator essential to normal lung function that is deficient in patients with PAH. With PAH, the elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries strains the right side of the heart as it pumps blood to the lungs. The extra stress causes the heart to enlarge and become less flexible, compromising its ability to push blood out of the heart through the lungs and into the rest of the body. PAH initially presents as exertional dyspnea, lethargy and fatigue and may be confused with other disease states with similar symptoms. PAH often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed until symptoms become severe, with the mean time from onset of symptoms to correct diagnosis being more than two years in the United States. As PAH progresses and right ventricular failure develops, exertional chest pain, or angina, exertional syncope and peripheral edema may develop. Following confirmation of diagnosis based on hemodynamic parameters, treatment is recommended to lower pulmonary pressures and treat the symptoms of PAH.
 PAH is part of a larger classification of pulmonary hypertension, or PH, which is divided into five groups based on the criteria of the World Health Organization, or WHO, as defined at the 5th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension in Nice, France. WHO Group I is comprised of individuals with PAH.
 PAH is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence in the United States expected to be approximately 30,000 patients by 2020. Today, the mean age of diagnosis is 50 years according to both French and U.S. registries, with more women being diagnosed with PAH than men. Patients may have idiopathic PAH, in which no underlying cause can be determined, or a heritable form of the disease. A large number of PAH patients also have associated comorbidities such as congenital heart disease, HIV, connective tissue diseases like scleroderma, liver diseases, systemic hypertension, obesity, clinical depression, non‑PAH related obstructive airways, sleep apnea and diabetes.
 Due to delayed diagnosis, many patients already have an advanced form of PAH, requiring aggressive treatment combining multiple classes of therapy. The severity of PAH may be classified according to the heart failure guidelines of the New York Heart Association, or NYHA, based on how much patients are limited during physical activity and described by the American Heart Association as follows:

· | NYHA Class I — No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation or dyspnea, which is shortness of breath.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NYHA Class II — Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation or dyspnea.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NYHA Class III — Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation or dyspnea.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NYHA Class IV — Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As reported by Decision Resources Group, gross revenue in the U.S. market for PAH drug therapies in 2017 was estimated to be $3.7 billion. Of such amount, $2.1 billion was generated from patients in NYHA Class III, $1.2 billion was generated from patients in NYHA Class II and an aggregate of $0.4 billion was generated from patients in NYHA Classes I and IV.
 As the disease progresses, these symptoms cause significant negative impact on the quality of life of patients, limiting their ability to do common daily activities, including work, travel and previous hobbies. Patients also describe the 

 
  8

 
emotional toll of PAH, including fear, frustration, embarrassment and stigma. The burden of care associated with currently available treatments can add further logistical and emotional burden to the patients.
 Current Therapies and Their Limitations
 There is currently no cure for PAH. The goals of existing treatments are to alleviate symptoms, maintain or improve NYHA functional class, delay disease progression and improve quality of life. Inhaled therapies are generally prescribed for, but not limited to, patients in NYHA Class II and Class III. Approved drugs target three distinct molecular pathways that have been implicated in the disease process: the prostacyclin pathway, the nitric oxide pathway and the endothelin pathway. Drugs targeting each of these pathways are used alone or in combination with each other to treat patients with PAH. Prostacyclin deficiency in the lung is a central dysfunction in PAH, but can be supplemented with prostacyclin analogs. Prostacyclin deficiency can also be managed with a recently approved selective IP prostacyclin receptor agonist, selexipag. Nitric oxide deficiency can be treated with phosphodiesterase‑5, or PDE5, inhibitors, which target a specific enzyme, increasing vasodilation. Endothelin overexpression in PAH patients causes vasoconstriction of pulmonary vasculature, but can be treated with endothelin receptor antagonists, or ERAs. Many physicians start their PAH patients on oral PDE5 inhibitors, oral ERAs or both. Drugs targeted to the prostacyclin pathway are usually added to these oral therapies, but can be used alone.
 Drugs targeting the prostacyclin pathway are central to PAH therapy. Prostacyclin is essential to normal lung function. In healthy people, prostacyclin, which is a vasoactive mediator, is continually released by lungs into arterial circulation to bind different receptors for different effects to regulate vessel tone, including direct vasodilation of pulmonary arteries, inhibition of the proliferation of smooth muscle cells within arteries and inhibition of platelet aggregation. To supplement the deficiency of prostacyclin in patients with PAH, several prostacyclin analogs have been developed including epoprostenol, which is administered intravenously; treprostinil, which can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or in nebulized or oral formulations; and iloprost, which can be administered intravenously or in nebulized form. A new class of drugs called selective IP prostacyclin receptor agonists help stimulate some of the mechanisms that would otherwise be promoted by prostacyclin or an analog. Selexipag is an oral drug and the only approved molecule in this new class.
 The goal of treatment targeting the prostacyclin pathway is to maximize a patient’s exposure to the highest tolerable level of drug. Prostacyclin analogs, like treprostinil, have been developed for continuous infusion, either intravenously or subcutaneously, inhalation using a nebulizer and oral administration in the form of tablets. The maximal efficacy benefit of any one drug in the prostacyclin pathway is partially limited by its specific safety profile. Drugs treating the prostacyclin pathway, including oral treprostinil and IP prostacyclin receptor agonists such as selexipag, are limited by side effects from binding of the drug to receptors in non‑targeted tissues, such as the gut and nerves, which can cause diarrhea, nausea and jaw pain. Nebulized solutions can have side effects including cough and upper airway irritation and pain caused by their topical irritant properties, which limits the amount of drug that can be given to the patient. As the disease progresses, patients will require continuous prostacyclin infusion to maximize drug exposure. Infusion pumps present unique risks related to infusion site pain and the risk of blood stream infections, and increase significant limitations on the quality of life of patients.
 Delivering prostacyclin analogs locally to the lungs by inhalation has been effective and generates fewer systemic side effects. Inhalation of prostacyclin analogs supplements the endogenous production of prostacyclin where it is normally synthesized, near the targeted pulmonary arteries. As a result, inhalation of prostacyclin analogs helps avoid adverse events related to off‑target tissues and takes advantage of binding key prostacyclin receptors that are preferentially expressed in the lung. The only inhaled prostacyclin analogs approved by the FDA are Tyvaso and Ventavis, which both require nebulizers.
 Decision Resources Group reported that more than 80% of PAH patients on inhaled therapy in the United States used Tyvaso in 2017. United Therapeutics reported approximately $373 million in total sales of Tyvaso in the United States. Tyvaso is approved in the United States and Israel but is not approved in Europe and Japan. Tyvaso is indicated for the treatment of PAH to improve exercise ability. The maximum recommended dose of Tyvaso is 54 mcg, delivered four times daily from a proprietary nebulizer, requiring nine breaths for each dose. In a long‑term open‑label extension study 

 
  9

 
of Tyvaso, patients continued treatment for a mean duration of 2.3 years, with 89% of patients achieving the target dose of 54 mcg, delivered in nine breaths, and 42% achieving a dose of 72 mcg, delivered in 12 breaths.
 Ventavis is approved in the United States, Europe and Japan. Ventavis is nebulized six to nine times a day during waking hours, no more than once every two hours, and takes six to ten minutes to administer per use. Ventavis is a synthetic analog of prostacyclin indicated for the treatment of PAH to improve a composite endpoint consisting of exercise tolerance, symptoms and lack of deterioration.
 Tyvaso and Ventavis require the use of proprietary nebulizers. Patients must follow specific instructions to set up and operate the device, clean the device daily, locate a power source or use a battery to operate the device, and carry the device and its associated accessories around in a large carrying case, along with distilled water, to administer the treatment throughout the day. As a result, the use of these approved inhaled prostacyclin therapies is typically limited to patients who have not responded to oral medications that target the three pathways. The current medical practice is to administer both an inhaled drug product and the patient’s existing oral ERA and/or PDE5 drug product concurrently, instead of withdrawing the administration of the oral drug product upon initiation of the inhaled drug product.
 Potential Benefits of Our Approach
 We believe LIQ861 can overcome the limitations of current nebulized therapies and has the potential to maximize the therapeutic benefits of treprostinil in treating PAH by safely delivering higher doses into the lungs using a convenient, palm‑sized, disposable DPI. In our Phase 1 trial, LIQ861 was well‑tolerated at doses approximately twice as high as the maximum recommended dosage of Tyvaso. These higher doses of inhaled dry powder treprostinil can also be administered in fewer breaths. Each dose of LIQ861 can be administered in one to four breaths, compared to nine breaths for the maximum recommended dosage of Tyvaso. Additionally, we believe LIQ861 may have the potential to improve overall patient adherence and quality of life by offering the convenience of a discrete, palm‑sized, disposable DPI. In our market research, patients expressed a preference for a DPI product, noting that it can fit easily into a purse, minimize hassle while traveling and reduce the breaths and time associated with their current nebulized treatments.
 The advantages of the LIQ861 product profile are enabled by the PRINT technology. Each LIQ861 particle is designed to enhance delivery and deep‑lung penetration. LIQ861 particles are a precise size and highly uniform since particles are formed from mold cavities that exactly match each other. Competing technologies, such as spray‑drying, create particles that have a broader variation in shape and size. As a result, particles farther from the mean target size would be too large or too small to reach the intended location in the deep-lung.
 Inspired by a naturally occurring pollen, LIQ861 PRINT particles have a one micrometer trefoil‑shape measured by an inscribed one micrometer circle as shown in the figure below. In vitro studies suggest that the uniformity of size and shape allow our inhaled particles to target delivery into the lungs while depositing less in the upper airways. Our independent control of the parameters of drug particles has enabled us to create the first clinically tested formulation that stabilizes treprostinil in an inhaled dry powder formulation.

     LIQ861 is administered using RS00 Model 8 DPI, a DPI manufactured by Plastiape S.p.A. There are products approved in the United States and Europe containing this device. This device and its variants have been used in at least eight marketed products globally since 2001, including Novartis’s Foradil Aerolizer®, for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD.

 Clinical Development
 In March 2017, we completed a Phase 1 trial of LIQ861 in 57 healthy volunteers. In January 2018, we announced the initiation of INSPIRE, our pivotal open-label Phase 3 clinical trial, evaluating LIQ861 for the treatment of PAH in the United States. LIQ861 was observed to be well-tolerated at the two-week timepoint in PAH patients. The safety data at the two-week timepoint addresses the FDA’s request for inclusion of such data in an NDA submission. During this two-week time period, LIQ861 was evaluated at capsule strengths up to 125 mcg treprostinil, with no study-drug related serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities observed. The INSPIRE study is designed to evaluate patients who have either been under stable treatment with nebulizer-delivered treprostinil for at least three months and are transitioned to LIQ861 under the protocol or who have been under stable treatment with no more than two non-prostacyclin oral PAH therapies for at least three months and have their treatment regimen supplemented with LIQ861 under the protocol. Patients adding LIQ861 to current non-prostacyclin oral therapies started at a capsule strength of 25 mcg treprostinil and those transitioned from nebulizer-delivered treprostinil at a stable dose were initiated at a capsule strength of LIQ861 lower than their current stable treprostinil dose. In both cases, LIQ861 was uptitrated in 25 mcg treprostinil incremental capsule strengths to symptom relief or the limit of tolerance. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of LIQ861. We are currently focusing our efforts on completing patient enrollment in our one-directional crossover sub-study of at least 18 patients to compare bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of treprostinil as the patients transition from Tyvaso to LIQ861. After review of an initial cohort of patients in our open-label INSPIRE trial, we amended the INSPIRE protocol to adjust pharmacokinetics sub-study dosing levels of LIQ861 to more closely match Tyvaso dosing levels on an emitted dose basis. We reported positive interim two-week safety data in January 2019 and expect to report pharmacokinetics results in the second quarter of 2019. We intend to conduct additional clinical work in support of our marketing and commercial activities in advance of our U.S. launch for LIQ861, including maintaining patients on LIQ861 up to our U.S. launch and collecting data relating to the effects of LIQ861 on hemodynamic measurements. In the United States, we plan to seek approval of our NDA under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which would allow us to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior conclusions of efficacy and safety for Tyvaso and the active ingredient treprostinil, which has been approved in four different products administered through the continuous infusion, inhaled and oral routes. We are targeting an NDA submission to the FDA for LIQ861 in late 2019 which submission will include the two-week safety data, the available two-month safety and tolerability data and our bioavailability and pharmacokinetics results. We expect the NDA to also include additional data generated from our clinical studies on LIQ861 and any further safety data available at that time. Results of Phase 1 Trial
 We conducted a randomized, placebo‑controlled, double‑blind, Phase 1 trial in 57 healthy volunteer subjects to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics following a single administration of LIQ861 at treprostinil capsule strengths between 25 mcg and 150 mcg. The subjects were enrolled into six dose cohorts. Within each dose cohort, subjects were randomized to receive LIQ861 or a placebo. Dose Selection
 For the first‑in‑human study, the initial dose for LIQ861 was chosen based on the indicated dosing for the reference listed drug, Tyvaso. Independent investigations of particle emission using the RS00 Model 8 DPI and simulated inspiration of the bulk powder from a nebulizer led to a projection that a 25 mcg treprostinil capsule strength of LIQ861 dry powder inhalation would result in approximately similar treprostinil administration as three breaths of Tyvaso, or 

 
  12

 
18 mcg of treprostinil, the lowest approved dose through nebulization. The following table shows LIQ861’s doses tested along with our estimate of the equivalent Tyvaso dose.


(1) | LIQ861 capsule treprostinil strength doses between 25 mcg and 100 mcg are single capsules. LIQ861 capsule treprostinil strength doses 125 mcg and 150 mcg are two capsules but if approved, they could be developed as single capsules and therefore only require one to two breaths.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Tyvaso (treprostinil) full prescribing information: initial dosage: 3 breaths (18 mcg); maximum recommended dosage: 9 breaths (54 mcg)
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our conclusion from this study is that the capsule strength of 75 mcg of LIQ861 is approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended dose of 54 mcg, or nine breaths, of Tyvaso, and the capsule strength of 150 mcg of LIQ861 is approximately double the maximum recommended dose of Tyvaso.
 Safety and Tolerability
 In the Phase 1 clinical trial, we escalated the treprostinil capsule strength of LIQ861 progressively from 25 mcg to 150 mcg. There were no dose‑limiting toxicities at the highest dose evaluated. We noted no serious adverse events or deaths and all reported treatment‑emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, related to the treatment were mild. The most frequent adverse event reported by subjects on LIQ861 was mild cough and throat irritation.
 We did not observe a proportional increase of adverse events as the treprostinil capsule strengths were escalated from 25 mcg to 100 mcg. No adverse events were observed in subjects who received the placebo PRINT particles that contained only excipients.
 Pharmacokinetics
 In the Phase 1 trial, the LIQ861 plasma levels increased proportionally as the dosage of LIQ861 increased, as shown in the graph below. At higher doses, 50% of subjects receiving LIQ861 had measurable treprostinil after four hours, which could indicate the potential to minimize symptoms between dosing cycles.

 LIQ861 Pharmacokinetic Results

     The LIQ861 blood levels, as determined by the area under the curve, which is a pharmacokinetic measurement of drug exposure in blood plasma over time, and the maximum concentration were similar to the data used in connection with the approval of Tyvaso, as reported in the FDA Summary Basis of Approval for Tyvaso. LIQ861 also had half‑life in the blood similar to such data. These results suggest that our formulation has not changed the pharmacokinetic profile of inhaled treprostinil.
 Results of Non‑Clinical Studies
 The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of treprostinil are well understood, having previously been characterized to support approval of Remodulin, which is treprostinil administered through subcutaneous or intravenous infusion, Orenitram®, which is treprostinil administered through extended-release tablets, and Tyvaso, which is treprostinil inhaled through a proprietary nebulizer. We plan to rely in part on the data used in support of FDA approval of these treatments, in addition to our own toxicity studies, to support the development and approval of LIQ861.
 In October 2016, we completed a 14‑day, repeat dose, inhalation toxicity study in rats to support the Phase 1 trial. In August 2017, we completed a 26‑week toxicology study in rats. In rats, pharmacokinetic profiles at the end of 14 days of LIQ861 treatment were generally similar to inhaled nebulized treprostinil delivered at similar treprostinil dose levels. Following 26 weeks of daily dosing, treprostinil exposure was slightly higher in LIQ861‑treated rats. The results from this study support chronic outpatient dosing of LIQ861 in patients with PAH in our Phase 3 trial.
 Phase 3 Trial
 In January 2018, we announced the initiation of INSPIRE, our pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating LIQ861 at treprostinil capsule strengths between 25 mcg and 150 mcg for the treatment of PAH in the United States. INSPIRE is an open‑label trial enrolling over 100 patients with PAH across multiple sites in the United States. Primary endpoints are long‑term safety and tolerability of LIQ861. Patients enrolled have been on stable doses of Tyvaso for at least three months or have been taking no more than two approved non‑prostacyclin oral PAH therapies.

 LIQ861 was observed to be well-tolerated at the two-week timepoint in PAH patients. The safety data at the two-week timepoint addresses the FDA’s request for inclusion of such data in an NDA submission. During this two-week time period, LIQ861 was evaluated at capsule strengths up to 125 mcg treprostinil, with no study-drug related serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities observed. Reported TEAEs were mostly mild in nature and consistent with inhaled prostacyclin therapy. As reported on January 7, 2019, the most common TEAEs reported with LIQ861 in ≥4% of the 109 PAH patients were cough (25%), headache (13%), throat irritation (12%), diarrhea (7%), dizziness (6%), oropharyngeal pain (5%) and chest discomfort (5%). Patients have continued to receive treatment beyond two weeks with the first patient dosed in March 2018. Additionally, we have one center dosing a patient above the 150 mcg treprostinil capsule strength. We are currently focusing our efforts on completing patient enrollment in our one-directional crossover sub-study of at least 18 patients to compare bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of treprostinil as the patients transition from Tyvaso to LIQ861. After review of an initial cohort of patients in our open-label INSPIRE trial, we amended the INSPIRE protocol to adjust pharmacokinetics sub-study dosing levels of LIQ861 to more closely match Tyvaso dosing levels on an emitted dose basis. We reported positive interim two-week safety data in January 2019 and expect to report our bioavailability and pharmacokinetics results in the second quarter of 2019. We are targeting an NDA submission to the FDA for LIQ861 in late 2019 which submission will include the two-week safety data, the available two-month safety and tolerability data and our bioavailability and pharmacokinetics results. We expect the NDA to also include additional data generated from our clinical studies on LIQ861 and any further safety data available at that time.
 Additional Clinical Trials
 We also intend to conduct an additional clinical trial in Europe that explores the hemodynamic effects of LIQ861 in PAH patients. Although the FDA has not requested that we undertake this clinical trial, the data may help assess the effects of LIQ861 on acute and chronic hemodynamic measurements and right heart function. Data from this clinical trial would also add to our understanding of safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of LIQ861.
 We intend to conduct additional clinical work in support of our marketing and commercial activities in advance of our U.S. launch for LIQ861, including maintaining patients on LIQ861 up to our U.S. launch.
 Commercial Opportunity
 Decision Resources Group estimated that sales for all major PAH drugs in 2017 were more than $3.7 billion in the United States. Products approved to treat PAH through the prostacyclin deficient pathway generated approximately $1.4 billion in sales in 2017, of which the prostacyclin analog treprostinil generated the majority from products formulated for continuous infusion, inhalation using a nebulizer and oral delivery, estimated to be approximately $915 million.
 If approved, we believe LIQ861 would be the first inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil delivered using a convenient, palm‑sized, disposable DPI. The dosing regimens and patient experience for the two approved inhaled therapies compared to the expected product profile of LIQ861 are shown in the following table.

      Preferred choice within inhaled options. As reported in our market research, physicians and patients expressed a clear preference for the expected product profile of LIQ861 over current nebulized therapies, primarily due to the ease and convenience of administration of LIQ861. Nebulized therapies require more time and breaths than LIQ861, as well as daily and weekly assembly, disassembly and cleaning.
 Attractive switch from orals. The ease and range of dosing LIQ861 may be attractive to patients who are in earlier stages of the disease, but poorly managed on oral prostacyclin products. Local delivery of treprostinil to the lung offers fewer systemic side effects. However, we believe some of these patients are hesitant to switch to more burdensome nebulized options.
 Delay transition to continuous infusion. We are investigating a wide range of LIQ861 doses in order to maximize patient exposure to treprostinil, a key factor in the efficacy of prostacyclin analogs. In our Phase 1 trial, LIQ861 was well‑tolerated at levels that we estimate are approximately twice the maximum recommended dose of Tyvaso. We believe the dose range enabled by LIQ861 would allow patients to titrate to higher levels of treprostinil and potentially extend the time on inhaled therapy, delaying the eventual transition to continuous infusion.
 Expand inhaled options outside the United States. We intend to develop and seek regulatory approval for LIQ861 for markets outside of the United States in order to provide an attractive choice that leverages the benefits of local delivery to the lung. Tyvaso is approved in the United States and Israel but is not approved in Europe and Japan. Ventavis is approved in the United States, Europe and Japan, but its use has been limited due to its delivery regimen. Decision Resources Group estimated that fewer than 10% of PAH patients in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and 

 
  17

 
Spain, which we collectively refer to herein as the 5EU, use Ventavis. In Japan, Ventavis was approved in May 2016 as the first inhaled PAH treatment. The combined population of diagnosed prevalent PAH patients in the 5EU and Japan was estimated to be approximately 25,000 patients in 2017.
 Expand beyond WHO Group I patients (PAH). Prostacyclin based therapies have only been approved for WHO Group I patients. However, prostacyclin analogs may have utility in the treatment of PH in other categories, as suggested by current off‑label use in WHO Group III, which includes individuals with pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung diseases or hypoxemia, and WHO Group IV, which includes individuals with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Although we have no current plans to study LIQ861 in PH patients outside of WHO Group I, we will continue to monitor the investigations conducted by other companies and independent investigators of prostacyclin analogs, especially Tyvaso. If Tyvaso is approved for additional indications, the path for seeking approval of LIQ861 in the same indications should be made clear and could quickly follow. For example, United Therapeutics is actively studying Tyvaso in a Phase 3 trial of a subpopulation of WHO Group III subjects with pre‑capillary PH with interstitial lung disease, including combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, with an estimated prevalence of 27,500 patients globally in this subpopulation. By 2025, the diagnosed prevalence of all WHO Group III sub‑types is expected to grow to over 250,000 patients in the United States, 5EU and Japan. WHO Group IV includes patients diagnosed with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, or CTEPH. While considered underdiagnosed and undertreated, the current estimates for diagnosed prevalence of CTEPH are between 2,000 and 6,500 patients in the United States and more than 10,000 patients in the 5EU and Japan.
 Competition in PAH
 If approved, LIQ861 would be one of several prostacyclin based products that can be used to manage a patient’s disease. Initially, it would be positioned between the use of oral options and the continuous infusion of prostacyclin analogs.
 In the inhaled category, the primary competitor for LIQ861 would be Tyvaso, the nebulized inhaled treprostinil. Tyvaso is administered by a proprietary nebulizer device four times per day. In addition to Tyvaso, LIQ861 would compete with inhaled iloprost, which is marketed as Ventavis in the United States by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, and in Europe by Bayer Schering Pharma AG. Ventavis is administered by a proprietary nebulizer device six to nine times per day.
 There would be additional competition from oral products in the prostacyclin pathway, including oral treprostinil, marketed as Orenitram by United Therapeutics, selexipag, marketed as Uptravi by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., and ralinepag, an oral treprostinil product for the treatment of patients suffering from PAH being studied in a Phase 3 clinical trial by Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Arena. These oral options may be used by a patient earlier in the disease cycle than LIQ861. However, we believe that LIQ861 could offer an attractive option for patients who are in earlier stages of the disease, but poorly managed on oral prostacyclin products. On January 24, 2019, Arena and United Therapeutics closed on a global license agreement for ralinepag. Under the agreement, United Therapeutics is now responsible for the development, manufacture and commercialization of ralinepag.
 Continuously infused prostacyclins include epoprostenol, marketed by multiple companies as generic and branded products, and treprostinil, marketed as Remodulin by United Therapeutics. These options are considered to offer the greatest efficacy and are usually prescribed to patients later in the disease. Infusion pumps present unique risks related to infusion site pain and the risk of blood stream infections, creating major limitations on the quality of life of patients.
 We are aware that MannKind has recently filed an IND and completed a Phase 1 trial evaluating an inhaled dry powder treprostinil product for the treatment of PAH. On October 15, 2018, United Therapeutics and MannKind closed their worldwide exclusive licensing and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of a dry powder formulation of treprostinil, an investigational product currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of PAH. Under the agreement, United Therapeutics will be responsible for global development, regulatory and commercial activities. MannKind will manufacture clinical supplies and initial commercial supplies of the product while long‑term commercial supplies will be manufactured by United Therapeutics. We also expect generic equivalents of Tyvaso may eventually enter the market following the expiry or invalidity of Tyvaso’s patents.

 LIQ865
 Our second product candidate, LIQ865, which is designed using PRINT technology, is an injectable, sustained‑release formulation of bupivacaine for the management of local post‑operative pain for three to five days after a procedure, which we believe, if approved, would have the potential to provide significantly longer post‑operative pain relief compared to currently marketed formulations of bupivacaine.
 Background on Post‑Operative Pain
 The treatment of post‑operative pain typically involves multi‑modal therapy including the administration of local anesthetics after surgery. Although local anesthetics provide a well‑established, safe and efficacious option for post‑operative pain management, the duration of efficacy for conventional local anesthetics, including bupivacaine and lidocaine, is limited, with the pain relief typically lasting for eight hours or less. Because post‑operative pain may continue to be severe for several days following the surgery, additional therapies are required. These therapies include morphine and other opioids administered through intravenous systems or orally, as well as various non‑opioids, including acetaminophen and NSAIDs, like ibuprofen and ketorolac.
 Current Therapies and Their Limitations
 Opioids are the mainstay of post‑operative pain management, but they are associated with a variety of unwanted and potentially serious or life‑threatening side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, cognitive impairment, respiratory depression and death. In addition, opioids may be administered through patient‑controlled analgesia systems, which may interfere with or delay patient ambulation and require significant hospital resources to implement and monitor. Furthermore, exposure to opioids for as little as four days can lead to increased risk of chronic opioid use. The risk of opioid abuse and diversion has led physicians, payors and the U.S. federal government to prioritize pain management strategies that minimize the use of opioids.
 NSAIDs and other non‑opioids for pain relief in the post‑operative period are also associated with various undesirable side effects. Bleeding and gastrointestinal and renal complications may result from NSAID use. Acetaminophen can cause liver injury or failure with excessive dosing. As a result, we believe there is demand from healthcare providers and patients for post‑operative pain relief therapies that can help prevent these issues.
 Local anesthetics such as bupivacaine hydrochloride, or Marcaine, and lidocaine have been safely used for post‑operative pain for decades, but have a duration of effect limited to less than eight hours. Approved in 2011, EXPAREL is a long‑acting local anesthetic that involves an injection of bupivacaine in a multivesicular liposome carrier at the surgical site and is marketed in the United States by Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Physicians report that EXPAREL typically provides postsurgical analgesia for only 24 to 36 hours in practice, and market research we conducted suggests that physicians desire longer duration of effect to better manage local post‑operative pain. In addition, because the interactions between the liposomal formulation of EXPAREL and co‑administered local anesthetics can result in rapid release of bupivacaine, co‑administration of other local anesthetics is inadvisable.
 Potential Benefits of Our Approach
 Using our PRINT technology, we have developed a particle formulation of bupivacaine that, if approved for marketing, will be used to manage local post‑operative pain. We engineered the size and composition of LIQ865 particles to slowly release bupivacaine with the goal of providing patients with local pain relief for three to five days through a single 

 
  19

 
administration, which we believe would provide significantly longer post‑operative pain relief compared to currently marketed formulations of bupivacaine. The figure below depicts LIQ865, showing size consistency among particles.

 LIQ865 is administered as a suspension and is easily injected at the surgical site. Because the molded drug particles are highly stable, we believe the potential for dose dumping, the unintended rapid drug release of bupivacaine from the carrier, would be minimized with LIQ865. In a non‑clinical study, co‑administration of LIQ865 with lidocaine did not cause early release of bupivacaine or otherwise negatively affect the pharmacokinetic profile of LIQ865. LIQ865 was engineered to be rapidly reconstituted and administered by injection. Unlike other sustained‑release formulations, we do not expect LIQ865 will be constrained by a specific ratio of drug to diluting agent so its reconstitution volume can be adjusted based on the volume needs of a particular procedure. Furthermore, because particle‑to‑particle uniformity in size and composition is key to determining drug release rates, the particle‑to‑particle and batch‑to‑batch uniformity of our LIQ865 particles creates consistent release rates.
 Results of Non‑Clinical Studies
 We commissioned an animal efficacy study of two formulations of LIQ865 in a rat perineural sciatic model, which was completed in January 2016. LIQ865 showed an extended pharmacokinetic profile and duration of nerve sensory block and the potential for extended post‑operative pain management. Additionally, we evaluated the safety and tolerability of LIQ865 in a rat toxicology study in 2016. The results of this study supported advancing LIQ865 to human clinical trials. We commenced preparation for Phase 2‑enabling toxicology studies in the fourth quarter of 2018 and expect to initiate the initial Phase 2‑enabling toxicology studies in the first quarter of 2019.
 Clinical Development
 In March 2017, we completed our Phase 1a trial in Denmark to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of two different PRINT formulations of bupivacaine: LIQ865A, consisting of particles combining bupivacaine and polylactic‑glycolic acid, a polymer widely used in sustained‑release drug products and surgical sutures; and LIQ865B, consisting of particles of bupivacaine alone, in a proprietary diluting agent. We observed a dose‑response relationship in this trial, and all doses were well‑tolerated. The results from the Phase 1a trial helped inform our selection of LIQ865A for further investigation in the United States. We filed an IND application in the United States in June 2017 and initiated a Phase 1b trial in the United States in September 2017 using an experimental pain model in healthy adults with quantitative sensory testing. We completed the U.S. Phase 1b trial in April 2018. We commenced preparation for Phase 2‑enabling toxicology studies in the fourth quarter of 2018 and expect to initiate these initial studies in the first quarter of 2019, we expect to complete these studies by the end of 2019 and expect to commence initial Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trials in 2020. In the United States, we plan to rely in part on the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for our NDA submission to the FDA for LIQ865, which would allow us to rely on the FDA’s prior determinations of safety and efficacy for other products containing bupivacaine, such as Marcaine and EXPAREL.

 Results of Phase 1 Trials
 Our Phase 1a trial was a randomized, double‑blind, controlled, single ascending dose, safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic trial of LIQ865A and LIQ865B in 28 healthy male volunteers at a single site in Copenhagen, Denmark. The study design included dosing multiple cohorts, or groups, each receiving increasing bupivacaine doses as either LIQ865A or LIQ865B: 150 mg, 225 mg, 300 mg, 450 mg or 600 mg. The LIQ865 formulation was injected into the upper calf in one leg, and the other leg received the diluting agent without LIQ865 particles. The primary objective of this Phase 1a clinical trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of the two formulations of LIQ865. We also assessed bupivacaine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses.
 Based on the results of the Phase 1a trial, we selected the LIQ865A formulation for further development, and all of our references to LIQ865 are to this formulation. Results for 16 volunteers who received LIQ865A in this Phase 1a trial are shown below. The graph shows the mean plasma concentration of bupivacaine over 120 hours comparing the 150 mg, 225 mg, 300 mg, 450 mg and 600 mg dose cohorts of LIQ865A formulation, expressed on a logarithmic, or log, scale.
 LIQ865A Log Linear Mean Concentration Over Time

 A dose‑response relationship was observed, with the plasma levels increasing as the dosage level of LIQ865 increased. Doses of LIQ865 up to 600 mg of bupivacaine were well‑tolerated in the trial. All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and most adverse events were limited locally at the site of injection, with most related to sensory block of underlying sensory branches of the saphenous nerve in the leg.
 At the 450 mg dose of LIQ865, all subjects had maximum concentration values below 800 ng/ml, which is well below the reported thresholds for neurotoxicity and cardiac toxicity of 2000 and 4000 ng/mL, respectively. The 

 
  21

 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile for this dose suggested a sustained duration of effect, with nearly all subjects receiving this dose reporting at least three days of sensory blunting in response to quantitative sensory testing. LIQ865 also showed rapid onset of action at the one‑hour time point in all subjects, even at the lowest dose of 150 mg. Additionally, we observed a sensory block of distal sensory branches of the saphenous nerve below the knee in eight of nine subjects who received 450 mg doses of LIQ865. This sensory block lasted at least three days, which we believe further supports the duration profile of LIQ865.
 In March 2017, we met with the FDA at a pre‑IND meeting and verified that the current Chemical Manufacturing and Control, or CMC, and preclinical package were “phase‑appropriate” and sufficient to support our initial U.S. Phase 1 trial.
 Following our submission of the IND for LIQ865, we initiated our U.S. Phase 1b clinical trial in September 2017, which was completed in April 2018. This trial used an experimental pain model in healthy male and female subjects with quantitative sensory testing after an injection of LIQ865 at doses of 150 mg, 300 mg and 450 mg. The experimental pain model was designed to simulate post‑operative pain for up to five days through a combination of localized ultraviolet B burn and mini‑incision. Additionally, the trial included a cross‑over design to compare LIQ865 to EXPAREL. We observed that LIQ865 was well‑tolerated across the dose ranges. All adverse events were mild to moderate, and no dose-limiting toxicities were noted. The pharmacokinetic profiles were similar to what was seen in the Phase 1a trial. Pharmacodynamic effects were highly variable and inconclusive, which we associated with the experimental design of the pain model used in the Phase 1b trial.
 Plans for Phase 2 Development
 At our pre‑IND meeting in March 2017, the FDA requested additional toxicology studies prior to the initiation of Phase 2 trials and we commenced preparation for our initial Phase 2‑enabling toxicology studies in the fourth quarter of 2018 which we expect to initiate in the first quarter of 2019. We anticipate completing these initial studies by the end of 2019. After reviewing the results of all of our Phase 2‑enabling toxicology studies for LIQ865, and subject to the availability of sufficient funding, we will develop and commercialize LIQ865 independently, if it is ultimately approved, or seek to license this product candidate to one or more third parties. We are targeting to commence initial Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trials in 2020. We will seek to identify, in our Phase 2 trials, the minimum and optimal effective dose of LIQ865 to achieve three or more days of pain relief. We expect that this dose would be carried forward into Phase 3 development. Competition
 The primary competitor for LIQ865, if approved, would be liposomal bupivacaine, marketed as EXPAREL by Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We are aware of other long‑acting local anesthetic products in clinical development from DURECT Corporation, Innocoll Holdings plc and Heron Therapeutics, Inc., or Heron, as well as generic equivalents of EXPAREL, which may enter the market following the expiry of EXPAREL’s patent in 2018. In October 2018, Heron announced the submission of its NDA to the FDA for HTX‑011, an investigational long‑acting, extended‑release formulation of the local anesthetic bupivacaine in a fixed‑dose combination with the anti‑inflammatory meloxicam for the management of postoperative pain. HTX‑011 was granted both breakthrough therapy and fast track designations from the FDA as well as priority review and a PDUFA date of April 30, 2019. In addition to long‑acting local anesthetics, there are a number of indirect competitors in development, including clinical‑stage opioids and development‑stage molecules that pursue the treatment of pain through alternative pathways. Our PRINT Technology
 Both LIQ861 and LIQ865 are being developed using our proprietary PRINT particle engineering technology, which allows us to engineer and manufacture highly uniform drug particles with independent control over the size, three‑dimensional geometric shape and chemical composition of the particles. By controlling these physical and chemical parameters of particles, PRINT enables us to engineer desirable pharmacological benefits into product candidates, including prolonged duration of drug release, increased drug loading, more convenient routes of administration, the ability to create novel combination products, enhanced storage and stability and the potential to 

 
  22

 
reduce adverse side effects. Controlling three‑dimensional geometric shape and chemical composition of drug particles enables us to research, identify and pursue the improvement of existing therapies and creation of new therapies from existing drugs or new chemical entities, including small molecules and biologics.
 Our ability to design and control these features of drug particles has the potential to provide significant benefits across the breadth of pharmaceutical applications. Product characteristics and features can be tuned depending on the need of a particular application, drug substance, delivery route and other such considerations. Based on our research to date, we anticipate the ability to: (i) enhance inhaled delivery through the highly uniform geometric shape of each drug particle; (ii) design desired drug release profiles ranging from minutes post‑delivery to days, weeks or months depending on need of a target therapy, by controlling the chemical composition of the drug particles and the surface area‑to‑volume ratio of the particles; (iii) enable combination products where one or more of the chemical constituents can destabilize or interact by encapsulating the desired constituent in a particle to shield it from another constituent during packaging and storage; and (iv) enhance the deposition and retention of topically delivered products by designing particles with a desired charge and/or Young’s modulus.
 Besides using our PRINT technology to develop our two product candidates, LIQ861 and LIQ865, we have exclusively licensed our PRINT technology to (i) GSK, a market leader in respiratory therapies, for applications broadly across inhaled delivery of their small molecule and biologic chemical entities, although we retained the ability to develop LIQ861; and (ii) Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which acquired most of the assets of Envisia Therapeutics, Inc. in 2017, for broad usage in the design and commercialization of small molecule and biologic ophthalmic therapies.
 Our molding approach, which we branded as “PRINT” or Particle Replication In Non‑wetting Templates, combines the precision of the semi‑conductor industry with the high throughput of roll‑to‑roll manufacturing to make highly uniform micro‑ and nano‑particles at a commercially viable scale. Our manufacturing equipment and materials used in the production of our drug particles are proprietary and protected by our patent portfolio and trade secret know‑how. Our PRINT equipment is also modular, scalable and cost‑effective.
 Our PRINT Process
 We begin our particle design by procuring a custom designed master template etched with three‑dimensional structures, or posts, that will become the eventual shape and size of our drug particles. These three‑dimensional structures are then replicated in negative form, through our proprietary processing into flexible rolls of polymeric PRINT molds. Our PRINT molds consist of thousands of linear feet of thin flexible molds up to twenty‑four inches wide. We then design and formulate our desired drug particle composition and apply that to our PRINT molds in our high‑throughput roll‑to‑roll processing equipment, with each particle mimicking the shape of the mold cavity from which it was molded, thus taking the shape of the original master template structures.
 The general components and steps of our PRINT molding are as follows:

· | Etch a master template with the three‑dimensional geometric structures of the desired particle size and shape (step A in the diagram below);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Apply our proprietary polymeric mold material over the master template (step B) and cure the polymeric material to form our PRINT molds with discrete molding cavities that replicate the structures of the master template (step C);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Design the chemical composition of the drug particle of interest (step D);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Apply the drug particle composition to the cavities in the mold to fill the cavities (step E);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Form the drug particles in the cavities of the mold that mimic the size and shape of the mold cavities (step F);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Remove the drug particles from the mold cavities on a harvesting film (step G); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  23

 


· | Remove the particles from the harvesting film for further functionalization, purification or packaging to be included in the final drug particle product (step H).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The diagram below shows the general steps involved in producing drug particles using our PRINT technology:

 We have translated the PRINT process into a continuous, roll‑to‑roll manufacturing process that we believe is compliant with cGMP and scaled to support clinical and commercial production, when required. One of our current manufacturing lines is shown below:

 Manufacturing and Supply
 Our facilities occupy approximately 45,000 square feet and are located in Morrisville, North Carolina. Within these premises, there are office space, research and development laboratories and equipment, analytical development and quality control laboratories, research, development and mold production facilities, research and development particle fabrication equipment, including two operational PRINT particle fabrication lines, both of which we believe are cGMP‑compliant, as well as appropriate staging, storage and stability facilities. These two operational PRINT particle fabrication lines are located within class ISO7 clean rooms that operate under applicable ISO and cGMP air quality and environmental requirements.
 We currently produce in this facility the product candidates for our and our collaborators’ preclinical studies and clinical trials. Our current operational PRINT particle fabrication lines are scaled and capable of producing the necessary materials to support our ongoing operations and planned studies and clinical trials and, we believe, ultimately our initial commercial scale manufacturing. The production capacity for each PRINT particle fabrication line within our production facility varies depending on the drug particle that is being produced.
 We are expanding our production facility, including the installation of an additional PRINT particle fabrication line in early 2018 and mold template production, which is intended to further increase our production capacity and capability in anticipation of the commercial production of LIQ861 and LIQ865, if and when we receive marketing approval for them. The capital expenditures for leasehold improvements in our facility related to this additional fabrication line were partially financed through reimbursement allowances provided by the landlord. In November 2018, we amended our primary lease with our landlord to expand into contiguous space for more optimized business operations and simultaneously terminated the lease to our second facility for non‑contiguous space.
 If and when we receive marketing approval for our product candidates, we may, from time to time, rely on third‑party CMOs to produce, package and distribute some or all of our approved drug products on a commercial scale.
 We also depend on third-party suppliers for clinical supplies, including active pharmaceutical ingredients which are used in our product candidates. For example, we currently rely on a sole supplier, LGM Pharma, LLC, or LGM Pharma, for treprostinil, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of LIQ861, and we currently rely on a sole supplier, Plastiape S.p.A., or Plastiape, for RS00 Model 8 DPI, the DPI used to administer LIQ861. We also rely on a sole supplier, Xcelience LLC (now a Lonza Group Ltd company), or Xcelience, for encapsulation and packaging services.
 Our Collaboration and Licensing Agreements
 In addition to advancing our own product candidates, we have collaborated, and may consider collaborating, with pharmaceutical companies to develop their own product candidates across a wide range of therapeutic areas, molecule types and routes of administration, leveraging our PRINT technology. These collaborations are intended to help advance new PRINT capabilities and build upon our competitive advantage in the pharmaceutical industry, while adding to our intellectual property portfolio.
 GlaxoSmithKline
 We have actively collaborated with GSK on the use of our PRINT technology in respiratory disease. In June 2012, we entered into an Inhaled Collaboration and Option Agreement, or the GSK ICO Agreement, with GSK to collaborate on research regarding the application of our PRINT technology to specified inhaled therapies. Pursuant to the GSK ICO Agreement, we granted GSK exclusive options and licenses to further develop and commercialize such inhaled therapies using our PRINT technology. In partial consideration of the rights granted to GSK under the GSK ICO Agreement, we received a one‑time up‑front payment of $4.0 million. We also entered into a stock purchase agreement with GSK pursuant to which GSK purchased 4,765,248 shares of our Series C‑1 convertible preferred stock for an aggregate of $3.8 million. In September 2015, GSK exercised its option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to certain of our know‑how and patents relating to our PRINT technology, for the purpose of, among others, preclinical studies of inhaled therapeutics developed, manufactured or otherwise produced using our PRINT technology. In connection with the grant of this license, we received a one‑time option exercise fee of $15.0 million. Under the terms of the GSK ICO 

 
  25

 
Agreement, we are also entitled to continued research and development funding, certain milestone payments aggregating up to $158 million upon the achievement of specified milestone events for new non‑rescue therapeutic products. Rescue therapeutic products are therapeutics that GSK develops with our PRINT technology that had previously been discontinued from development. We are also entitled to tiered royalties on the worldwide sales of the licensed products at percentages ranging from the mid‑single digits to low‑single digits depending on the total number of products developed and other royalty step‑down events with a fixed low‑single digit royalty floor under the GSK ICO Agreement. In February 2016, we received a $3.0 million payment from GSK upon the achievement of a clinical development milestone.
 GSK has the right to terminate the GSK ICO Agreement in its entirety or on a product‑by‑product basis upon a specified period of prior written notice. Upon termination of the GSK ICO Agreement, each party will continue to have the right to practice and/or license its interest in any know‑how developed during the collaboration without seeking the consent of, or accounting to, the other party.
 Through this collaboration, we have worked together with GSK to advance inhaled therapeutic products toward clinical studies. In June 2018, GSK notified us of its intention to review continuation of development of an inhaled antiviral for viral exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, candidate that was formulated as an inhaled, dry powder using the PRINT technology, part of the GSK ICO Agreement, after completion of its related Phase 1 clinical trial. On July 20, 2018, GSK confirmed that it will not continue the COPD program. As of December 31, 2018, GSK was in the reporting phase of the Phase 1 trial of the COPD program. We do not expect to incur additional expenses directly associated with the COPD program. GSK continues to express an interest in using PRINT technology for new inhaled programs, though no specific assets or activities have been identified at this time.
 The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
 In December 2008, we entered into the Amended and Restated License Agreement with UNC for the use of certain patent rights and technology relating to initial innovations of our PRINT technology, or the UNC License. Under the terms of the UNC License, we have an exclusive license to such patent rights and technology for our drug products. The UNC License grants us the right to grant sublicenses to the technology as well as control the litigation of any infringement claim instituted by or against us in respect of the licensed patent rights. We are also responsible for the costs of all expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the patents and patent applications. Such filings and prosecution will be carried out by UNC and in UNC’s name but under our control.
 Under the UNC License, we are required to pay UNC royalties equal to a low single digit percentage of all net sales of our drug products whose manufacture, use or sale includes any use of the technology or patent rights covered by the UNC License, as well as tiered royalty percentages ranging in the low single digits of sales by our sublicensees for any product covered by rights under a sublicense agreement granted pursuant to the UNC License. Under the UNC License, we are also required to pay UNC 20% of all fees other than royalties that we collect and are attributable to UNC sublicensed intellectual property. As consideration for the UNC License, we paid UNC a license issue fee in the form of 196,469 shares of our Class B non‑voting common stock in 2004. During the term of the UNC License, we have also paid approximately $2.9 million in the aggregate to UNC pursuant to a Supported Research Agreement, or the SRA. In connection therewith, we may exclusively license resulting inventions under the SRA for a $5,000 up‑front license fee per invention. We have also paid aggregate consideration of $5.7 million in sublicense fees to UNC pursuant to the UNC License, for our sublicenses of our PRINT technology to GSK and G&W Labs, as described above. We also reimburse UNC for its costs of procuring and maintaining the patents we license from UNC. Such reimbursements amounted to $129,778 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Effective November 2017, we satisfied all substantive milestones associated with our UNC License other than semi‑annual and annual reporting‑based milestones that continue through the term of the UNC License. The UNC License expires (i) on the expiration of the last to expire patent included in the patent rights or (ii) if no patents mature from such patent rights, in December 2028.
 We have the right to terminate the UNC License upon a specified period of prior written notice. UNC may terminate the UNC License in certain circumstances, including if we fail to pay royalty or other payments on time or if we fail to sublicense in accordance with the terms of the UNC License. Upon termination of the UNC License, we must pay any royalty obligations due upon termination.

 Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature and protection of our product candidates, their methods of use and our platform technology that enables our product candidates are an important part of our business strategy of rapidly developing and commercializing new medicines that address areas of significant unmet medical needs.
 Our policy is to seek patent protection of our proprietary product candidates and technology by filing U.S., international and certain foreign patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the growth and protection of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to patent protection or where we do not consider patent protection to be adequate or applicable.
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other protection for our product candidates, enabling technology, inventions and know‑how and our ability to defend and enforce these patents, preserve the proprietary nature of our trade secrets and operate our business without infringing valid and enforceable patent and other proprietary rights of third parties. We pursue both composition‑of‑matter patents and method‑of‑use patents for our product candidates. We are also pursuing patents covering our proprietary PRINT micro‑ and nano‑particle fabrication technology.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non‑provisional patent application to which the patent claims priority in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, or PTA, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended, or the Hatch‑Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension, or PTE, of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended. Further, only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the extension only applies to the approved drug, method for using it or method for manufacturing it for which the extension was obtained. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.
 We are the owner or exclusive licensee of patents and applications relating to our proprietary technology platform and our product candidates, and are pursuing additional patent protection for these and for our other product candidates and technology developments.
 We have a total of 163 patents and pending patent applications in our patent portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, we were the sole owner of 14 patents in the United States and 26 patents in foreign jurisdictions, as well as approximately 21 additional pending patent applications, including provisional patent applications, in the United States, Europe, Japan and other jurisdictions. In addition to the patents and patent applications owned solely by us, our patent portfolio also includes 72 patents and 30 patent applications licensed from third parties. As of December 31, 2018, we had an exclusive, worldwide license from UNC to 17 U.S. patents and 54 foreign patents, as well as 11 additional patent applications in the United States or selected foreign jurisdictions. Seven of the patents and two of the patent applications in the portfolio licensed from UNC are jointly owned by us.

 Sales and Marketing
 We have retained worldwide commercial rights for our internal product candidates. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the United States by building and utilizing our own commercial infrastructure. Outside of the United States, we intend to pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates in collaboration with others, while leveraging the regional expertise of a commercialization partner. In addition, we plan to establish collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to commercialize our products in foreign markets. Considering our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities.
 With regard to our lead product candidate, LIQ861, we intend to focus our commercial efforts initially on the U.S. market, which we believe represents the largest market opportunity. Within the United States, we believe that we can effectively commercialize LIQ861, if approved, with an initial specialty field team of approximately 50 individuals. We intend to initially pursue a highly concentrated target market of PAH centers of excellence and high prescribers of PAH therapies. Our physician call points within these sites of care will include cardiologists, pulmonologists and their supporting staff. We expect to supplement our field team with medical science liaisons and reimbursement specialists to support the proper training and utilization of LIQ861. As part of our commercialization strategy, we plan to educate physician specialists, healthcare practitioners, patients and caregivers of the benefits of LIQ861 and its proper use. We plan to work with national associations, such as the Pulmonary Hypertension Association, and patient advocacy groups to update treatment guidelines to include LIQ861, a new, convenient, novel product with a wide range of dosing flexibility.

 Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid and significant technological change and places emphasis on the value of proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies and experience provide us with a competitive advantage, our competitors include organizations such as major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, biopharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaboration arrangements with large, established companies.
 Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing, on an exclusive basis, technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than products that we are currently selling through collaborators or developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and non-competitive. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. We also expect to face competition in our efforts in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical trial sites, patient enrollment in clinical trials and in identifying appropriate collaborators to help commercialize any approved products in our target commercial markets.
 Government Regulation
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, (including manufacturing changes), quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record‑keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. U.S. Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations.
 Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  30

 


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical studies according to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA, containing the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, to request approval to market the drug product;

  The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. When a sponsor wants to proceed to test the product candidate in humans, it must submit an IND in order to conduct clinical trials.
 An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical study and places the study on a clinical hold within that 30‑day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non‑compliance, and may be imposed on all product candidates within a certain pharmaceutical class. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical studies of a certain duration or for a certain dose.
 All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical study. Further, an IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical study are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.

 Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

· | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life‑threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. Involves clinical studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 There are FDA‑imposed limitations on communications about investigational drugs. The FDA prohibits companies from making promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation, and from “commercialization” of the drug before it is approved for commercial distribution.
 Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the product.
 The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial application user fee although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first 

 
  32

 
human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program user fees.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, an NDA application (or a supplement to an application) for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless the applicant has obtained a waiver or deferral.
 A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an End‑of‑Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed‑upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical studies or other clinical development program.
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be re‑submitted with the additional information. The re‑submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review.
 The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP‑compliant. There are numerous FDA personnel assigned to review different aspects of an NDA, exercising judgment, discretion, and interpretation of data relative to the review process.
 The FDA may approve an NDA only if the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture processing, packing and testing of the product are adequate to ensure and preserve its identity, strength, quality and purity.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA often will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured.
 The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions.
 Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure clinical data supporting the submission were developed in compliance with GCP.
 The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional preclinical, clinical or CMC data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for 

 
  33

 
approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than an applicant interprets the same data.
 After the FDA’s evaluation of an application, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met to secure final approval of the application and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing.
 Even with submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post‑approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical studies, to further assess safety and effectiveness after approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 New Drug Applications
 Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA (described above) for innovator products, or an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, for generic products. Relevant to ANDAs, the Hatch‑Waxman Act amendments to the FDCA established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of ANDAs for generic versions of branded drugs previously approved by the FDA (such previously approved drugs are also referred to as listed drugs). Because the safety and efficacy of listed drugs have already been established by the brand company (sometimes referred to as the innovator), the FDA does not require a demonstration of safety and efficacy of generic products. However, a generic manufacturer is typically required to conduct bioequivalence studies of its test product against the listed drug. The bioequivalence studies for orally administered, systemically available drug products assess the rate and extent to which the active pharmaceutical ingredient is absorbed into the bloodstream from the drug product and becomes available at the site of action. Bioequivalence is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent for absorption of the generic product and the listed drug. For some drugs, including locally acting drugs such as topical anti‑fungals, other means of demonstrating bioequivalence may be required by the FDA, especially where rate and/or extent of absorption are difficult or impossible to measure. In addition to the bioequivalence data, an ANDA must contain patent certifications and chemistry, manufacturing, labeling and stability data.
 A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a 505(b)(2) NDA, enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings with respect to certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product 

 
  34

 
candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents of the applicant or that are held by third parties whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any subsequent applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make one of the following certifications to the FDA concerning patents: (1) the patent information concerning the reference listed drug product has not been submitted to the FDA; (2) any such patent that was filed has expired; (3) the date on which such patent will expire; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method‑of‑use rather than certify to a listed method‑of‑use patent.
 If the reference NDA holder or patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. Thus approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non‑patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Combination Products
 Medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products, or medical devices are regulated as “combination products” in the United States. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprised of components from two or more regulatory categories, such as drug/device, device/biologic or drug/biologic. The term combination product includes: (i) a product comprised of two or more regulated components (i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic or drug/device/biologic, that are physically, chemically or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity); (ii) two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products or biological and drug products; (iii) a drug, device or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, such as to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or (iv) any investigational drug, device or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication or effect.
 Each constituent part of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of constituent part, whether a new drug, biologic or device. In order to facilitate pre‑market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre‑market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product, and typically one application, such as for a drug/device combination product assigned to the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, an NDA, will be made.

 
  35

 

 A device with the primary purpose of delivering or aiding in the delivery of a drug and distributed containing a drug (i.e., a “prefilled delivery system”) is typically evaluated by CDER using drug authorities and device authorities, as necessary.
 A device with the primary purpose of delivering or aiding in the delivery of a drug and that is distributed without the drug (i.e., unfilled) is typically evaluated by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health and CDER, respectively, unless the intended use of the two products, through labeling, creates a combination product.
 The FDA has indicated that dry powder inhalers, such as our lead product candidate, LIQ861, are drug/device combination products.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping (including certain electronic record and signature requirements), periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of certain adverse experiences, deviations and other problems with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 Manufacturers and certain other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. Combination products are subject to FDA regulation to ensure the quality of both the constituent parts and the finished product.
 Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 The FDA may impose a number of post‑approval requirements as a condition of approval of an application. For example, the FDA may require post‑marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.

 
  36

 

 Potential implications include required revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post‑market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | warning letters or holds on post‑approval clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. As a compliance best practice and risk mitigation measure, pharmaceutical companies typically train their sales force regarding the limitations on promotion of products relative to their approved indications for use and concerns regarding potential “off‑label promotion.” However, a physician may use products off‑label, when in the physician’s independent professional medical judgment he or she deems it appropriate. Recent court decisions have impacted FDA’s enforcement activity regarding off‑label promotion in the light of First Amendment considerations; however, there are still significant risks in this area in part due to the potential for False Claims Act exposure.
 The distribution of prescription drugs is subject to the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, which regulates the distribution of the products at the federal level, and sets certain standards for federal or state registration and compliance of entities in the supply chain and regulation of manufacturers and repackagers, wholesale distributors, third-party logistics providers, and dispensers. The DSCSA preempts previously enacted state pedigree laws and upon taking effect superseded the pedigree requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA. Trading partners within the drug supply chain must now ensure certain product tracing requirements are met, and are required to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statements. Further, the DSCSA limits the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products and imposes requirements to ensure overall accountability and security in the drug supply chain. The distribution of product samples continues to be regulated under the PDMA.
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidance and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 Patent Term Restoration
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited PTE under the Hatch‑Waxman Act. The Hatch‑Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term effectively lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one‑half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension. Extensions are not granted as a matter of right and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within a sixty day period from the date the product is first approved for commercial marketing. The USPTO, in 

 
  37

 
consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any PTE or restoration. In the future, we may apply for PTEs, defined as the length of the regulatory review of products covered by our granted patents, for some of our currently owned or licensed applications and patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates. Such extensions will depend on the length of the regulatory review; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us.
 Marketing Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The specific scope varies, but fundamentally the FDCA provides a five‑year period of non‑patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non‑infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three‑year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving applications for drugs containing the original active agent. Five‑year and three‑year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well‑controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non‑patent exclusivity periods described above. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric clinical study in accordance with an FDA‑issued “Written Request” for such a clinical study.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third‑party payors. Third‑party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Some of the additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement levels imposed by third‑party payors influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific drugs on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA‑approved drugs for a particular indication, or place drugs at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third‑party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement may differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third‑party payors.
 Reimbursement may also impact the demand for drug products that obtain marketing approval. If coverage for a drug product is obtained by a third‑party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co‑payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third‑party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Prescribing physicians are unlikely to use or prescribe drug products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of those drug 

 
  38

 
products. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, a drug product which has obtained marketing approval may not be successfully commercialized.
 Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost‑effective. If third‑party payors do not consider a product to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
 The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government‑paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our drugs and product candidates from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
 In addition, we expect that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third‑party payors and government authorities to continue and will place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third‑party payors often play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any currently marketed products and product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians, third‑party payors and customers, and our sales, marketing and educational activities, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations (at the federal and state level) that may constrain our business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval.
 In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following:

· | The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities including pharmaceutical manufacturers from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to, among other things, arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. The term “remuneration” expressly includes kickbacks, bribes or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, waivers of payment, ownership interest and providing anything at less than its fair market value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. The failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case‑by‑case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.

person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.

· | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to, or approval by, the federal government that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the federal government. Although we do not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off‑label, marketing products of sub‑standard quality, or, as noted above, paying a kickback that results in a claim for items or services. In addition, our activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third‑party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, federal Anti‑Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off‑label promotion, may also implicate the False Claims Act. Although the False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.

· | HIPAA, as amended by as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose, among other things, obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, and business associates. Among other things, HITECH made certain aspects of HIPAA’s rules (notably the Security Rule) directly applicable to business associates — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain individually identifiable health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal court to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.

This law will go into effect in 2021, requiring reporting of payments and transfers made in that same calendar year.

The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.

  Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that certain business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws, as

 Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA as amended was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:
· | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the HHS as a condition of Medicare Part B and Medicaid coverage of the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP, establishing new methodologies by which AMP is calculated and rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are collected for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended-release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, expanding the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations. and expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits.

· | In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. Recent proposed guidance from the HHS Health Resources and Services Administration, if adopted in its current form, may affect manufacturers’ rights and liabilities in conducting audits and resolving disputes under the 340B program.

· | Expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in April 2010 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133.0% of the federal poverty level beginning in 2014, thereby potentially increasing both the volume of sales and manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability.

· | The ACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 50% (and 70% commencing on January 1, 2019) discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., the donut hole) in order for Part D coverage to be available for the manufacturer’s covered Part D drugs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The ACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs with aggregate branded prescription drug sales over $5 million to certain government healthcare programs or pursuant to coverage under such programs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.

· | The ACA established a new Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products by influencing decisions relating to coverage and reimbursement rates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, or Innovation Center, within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. The Innovation Center has been funded through 2019, and funding will be automatically renewed for each 10‑year budget window thereafter.

  Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax‑based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA‑mandated fees, including the so‑called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer‑sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non‑exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining 

 
  43

 
provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. While the Texas District Court Judge, as well as the Trump Administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, then‑President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products.
 Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low‑income patients. Additionally, on May 11, 2018, President Trump laid out his administration’s “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs, as well as additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct‑to‑consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. Although most of these, and other, proposals will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, the U.S. Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs, including by addressing the role of pharmacy benefit managers in the supply chain. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA approval under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 Foreign Regulation of Drugs
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we will need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding development, approval, commercial sales and 

 
  44

 
distribution of our products, and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 63 full‑time employees, including seven employees in management (including our executive officers), 25 employees in research and development, 15 employees in manufacturing and technical operations, six employees in regulatory and quality and ten employees in general and administration.
