Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a consumer-driven, agricultural food ingredient company. We aim to create value across the agricultural production and supply chain beginning with enhanced crop productivity for farmers and ultimately to deliver accelerated innovation in nutritional quality consumer foods.  We use state of the art gene-editing technology and advanced breeding techniques to naturally enhance the nutritional quality of grains and oilseeds to address the rapidly evolving trends in consumer health and nutrition. In addition, we have developed a broad pipeline of high value crop productivity traits designed to enhance farm economics.  
 
Consumers are demanding healthier, high quality foods, naturally and sustainably produced with greater ingredient simplicity and transparency from food companies.  Now more than ever, consumers are paying premium pricing to satisfy their dietary health requirements, such as higher fiber and lower gluten, healthier oils and fewer processed ingredients. Conventional and transgenic breeding processes can take between 9-13 years to bring new food varieties or quality traits to market, which has resulted in consumer food companies searching for alternative means to satisfy the evolving customer demands. Consumer demand for rapid product differentiation has created a premium food market opportunity that is becoming one of the fastest growing segments in the food industry. 

To address this large and growing demand, we are building on our industry leading scientific expertise and advanced plant breeding technologies developed over the past 15 years to produce nutrient-dense crops for use in the major foods we eat. By employing gene editing technology using our proprietary TILLING platform, we believe we can reduce the time to market by half for novel trait ingredients, thereby providing consumer food companies a steady and reliable source of cost effective, healthy natural food options. 
 
We are developing a suite of branded, high value, healthy ingredients in wheat. First to market will be our high fiber Resistant Starch (RS) wheat which has more dietary fiber than conventional wheat. Increased fiber consumption is well recognized as a way to improve gut health and to control excessive weight gain. Concurrently, we are developing three additional wheat traits, a reduced gluten wheat, an extended shelf life wheat and a superior yielding wheat. In the traditional American diet more than 500 calories a day come from wheat products, 25 percent of the FDA’s recommended daily caloric intake for women and 20 percent for men, which creates a natural market opportunity for our first two wheat products. We believe these varieties have broad application in the annual global wheat market which is estimated by the FDA to be 758 million metric tons or approximately $127 billion.
 
In years to come, we expect to achieve enhanced nutritional characteristics within a number of other broad acre crops, other than wheat, using advanced breeding and gene-editing techniques. Targets include but are not limited to higher fiber, longer shelf life and enhanced protein in crops other than wheat.          
 
An important aspect of our business is improving farmer productivity through the development of more robust crop varieties, by developing specific crop traits designed to counteract the detrimental impact of environmental stresses on harvest yields. Traditional genetic modification (GM) trait development has concentrated on crops where the combination of large acreage and high input costs (such as pest and 
weed control chemical costs) create significant economic value for herbicide or insecticidal traits. However, far more deleterious to crop yields are abiotic stresses, such as drought, heat, nutrient deficiency, water scarcity, and soil salinity. Mitigation of these abiotic stresses remain largely unpenetrated by the GM seed industry today. For example, industry estimates indicate greater than 80 percent of wheat yield loss and 65 percent of corn yield loss globally are lost due to abiotic factors. These stresses are prevalent in most agricultural environments with varying degrees of severity and often have material consequences on crop production, quality, and farmer incomes. 
 
Phillips McDougall estimates the abiotic stress mitigation trait market to be worth several billion dollars. We devoted much of our early research to building the most comprehensive array of abiotic stress traits in the world. Furthermore, through broad out-licensing arrangements with our commercialization partners, many of our traits have been bred into several global crops, including rice, wheat, and soybeans, and we have demonstrated significant yield improvements in multiple years of field testing. Upon commercialization, our commercial value share is expected to range between 10% and 50%, depending upon the geography, crop and specific trait.
 2

Our commercial strategy is to migrate forward in the ag-food supply chain from the farmer and seed company to the consumer food company. Due to our early stage focus on the development of abiotic stress traits, we have historically been commercially aligned with farmers and seed companies. However, by also establishing commercial relationships with consumer food companies and developing consumer brand awareness of our high value premium ingredients, we expect to be better positioned to garner a greater share of the market. Consumer food companies are looking to simplify their food ingredient formulations and consumers are demanding “clean labeling” in their foods, paying more for foods having fewer artificial ingredients and more natural, recognizable and healthy ingredients. Ninety-one per cent of U.S. consumers believe food and beverage options with recognizable ingredients are healthier. Because we engineer nutrient density directly into staple grains and oils, we provide the mechanism for food formulation simplification naturally, cost effectively and in a time-frame to meet evolving consumer demands. 
 
This forward migration in the ag-food supply chain will require we build additional organizational capabilities and industry expertise. For instance, we are expanding our in-house commercial grain production and logistics resources for greater scale capacity to bring our identity preserved products to market. We are also developing product branding strategies to build customer brand recognition and loyalty. 
 
Our Strengths 
 
We believe we are well positioned among our peers to capitalize on the need to increase the efficiency, quality and speed of innovation in agricultural product differentiation to meet the demand for healthier food choices. Our combination of technological innovation, assets and experience is why we believe we are uniquely positioned to best meet this challenge by improving crop yields to enhancing crop nutrition:

• | World-class research capabilities. Our in-house scientific and product development expertise coupled with our advanced Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes, or TILLING, know-how have resulted in the discovery and development of several traits in our commercialization pipeline. Our TILLING platform enables us to discover and develop value-added traits that are considered non-GM. This platform leverages high-throughput screening of induced genetic diversity in plant populations in major crops. Our TILLING populations currently include wheat, rice, soybean, and canola. These populations include numerous native and induced gene function alterations, which can be exploited rapidly at low cost and with minimal regulatory requirements. While the TILLING approach is also practiced elsewhere, we believe that the combination of our history and specialized background in the technology, highly refined skills in developing and screening genetic diversity in plant populations, and proprietary TILLING know-how make us a leader in commercial applications of TILLING. During 2017, we obtained a license from the Broad Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard for research use of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology. This new platform will enable us to accelerate the development of existing products in our portfolio, including those TILLING projects, as well as bring new products to the market faster from inception.

• | Industry leading early phase trait development. Since the inception of the Company we have successfully advanced, and continue to advance, several potentially high value traits from the proof of concept stage to advanced field testing. More recently, in the case of HB4 stress tolerant soybeans we have, through our Verdeca joint venture, advanced the trait beyond field testing and into the regulatory phase. By licensing our traits at a later stage of development, we expect to reduce the risk and expense associated with bringing products to market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A broad intellectual property portfolio. Arcadia’s patent portfolio includes 137 issued patents with 48 pending applications worldwide, relating to our trait technologies and business methods that are either owned or exclusively controlled by us. Our ability to secure exclusive patent rights to our technologies is a key strength for the Company and one that preserves our competitive position.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expert regulatory affairs capability. Our regulatory team has the proven experience and demonstrated capability to manage regulatory submissions and approvals, including regulatory studies, field trials, regulatory submission, regulatory approvals and commercial launch. Our ability to bring traits through the regulatory process quickly and cost-effectively is a key differentiating factor and a capability we have deployed for our own internal development efforts, as well as in collaboration with our development and commercialization partners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | We have a diverse portfolio of products and partners. Our product portfolio consists of a wide variety of traits that are applicable to major crops in key geographic markets and address agricultural yield and product quality. The applicability of our product portfolio to these major crops provides us access to multiple large end markets that we believe have demonstrated or have the potential for high growth, such as soybeans in North and South America and wheat and rice globally. We have a record of forming and nurturing successful partnerships with many of the leading seed companies, grain processors and health and nutrition product companies.

Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe there are significant opportunities to grow our business by executing the following elements of our strategy:
  
• | Accelerate the commercialization of our health and nutrition trait portfolio. Our highest priority and primary forward investment is to accelerate the commercialization of our wheat ingredient trait portfolio, first targeting the bread, pasta and animal feed markets with our high fiber Resistance Starch and Reduced Gluten lines. We believe these products can be launched into the market over the next two to three years, and we are working with collaborators who are actively advancing the technical and commercial potential of these products. Bringing our ARA (arachidonic acid) oil from safflower and other plant-based nutritional oils to market is another area of targeted growth for us.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance commercialization of GM traits in regions where regulatory processes are predictable. Our Verdeca joint venture continues to advance the HB4 Drought Tolerance trait in soybeans towards commercialization in the Americas, with Argentina to be the first launch country. Regulatory approvals were obtained in Argentina in 2015 and with US FDA in 2017. Regulatory submissions were made in 2016 for import approval of HB4 soybeans into China. We plan to submit for production approval in Brazil and import approval in the European Union in 2018.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Actively support our licensees’ product development, deregulation and commercialization efforts. Critical to our longer term strategy is unlocking the commercial potential of our key agricultural yield traits, such as Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), Water Use Efficiency (WUE), and Salt Tolerance, in key food crops like rice, wheat and sugarcane and fiber crops like cotton. We are actively engaged with our partners to determine and execute optimal strategies to advance these traits through deregulation in these territories.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to invest in our human resources and commercialization capabilities. As we migrate forward in the ag-food supply chain to become more consumer facing and commercially aligned with consumer food companies, greater in-house consumer product knowledge and industry experience will be required. We will continue to invest in acquisition, development and retention of the requisite management and industry experience and production and logistics capacity to more fully participate in, and control, the route to market for our high value food ingredients.

Our Products and Product Development Pipeline
 
During 2017, we continued to rationalize program expenses and Company resources against a set of near, mid-term and long-term priorities to support our growth strategy which provided further clarity on commercialization priorities for health and nutrition ingredient traits and deregulation priorities for our abiotic stress trait out-licenses.  Our current products and product candidates are depicted below:




The development and commercialization staging of our health and nutrition ingredient traits reflect the time to market we expect based upon the remaining breeding and production requirements to achieve optimal market penetration. In 2017, we in-licensed the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, substantially augmenting the speed at which we can bring technologies discovered through our tilling technology platform to market as well as new versions of existing traits and entirely new discoveries. Our wheat portfolio development phases are depicted in table below, along with the estimated potential impact of CRISPR-Cas9 on our commercialization timelines:

Enhanced Quality Grains
 
We have multiple programs aimed at developing wheat and other small grains with improved nutritional qualities. One such program generated multiple bread and pasta wheat lines with very high levels of amylose, leading to increased levels of resistant starch. Resistant starch increases the total dietary fiber content of wheat and reduces its glycemic index, which are both desirable nutritional qualities that are important in the management of diabetes and healthy blood glucose levels. High fiber Resistant Starch wheat can deliver fiber and other benefits to great-tasting refined white flour products and also whole grain food products. In 2016, the FDA approved the use of qualified health claims for corn-based resistant starch in the risk reduction of type-2 diabetes, thus establishing a key precedent for the health benefits associated with this fiber. In 2012, the average American consumed only 40% of the recommended level of daily dietary fiber, with whole grain consumption representing only 15% of targeted fiber intake and 80% of teenagers eating no whole grains. Even so, grain products make up the largest fiber source in US adults. Improving the fiber content of wheat is the ideal vehicle to deliver improved health benefits to a wide population.
 
A second program aims at improving the flavor profile and shelf-life of whole wheat flour, and is funded by Ardent Mills, which combines the operations of ConAgra Mills and Horizon Milling, a Cargill-CHS joint venture. A third program, funded by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, is aimed at reducing gluten in wheat and other grains. All three of these programs utilize our TILLING platform, and the resulting products are non-GM.
 
High Fiber Resistant Starch Wheat 
 
Our high fiber Resistant Starch (RS) wheat provides a source of wheat with inherently high levels of resistant starch, increasing the total dietary fiber content of food products without the need for fiber additives from other sources. Currently, corn resistant starch is a product in two market segments: dietary fiber additives and modified starch additives. According to MarketsandMarkets, the global dietary fibers market is projected to reach $6.5 billion by 2022 and the modified starch market is projected to $12.4 billion in 2022. Major growth in these markets is being driven by the convenience health food sector and functional food sector. Flour from our RS wheat lines has resistant starch levels that are 12 to 20 times higher than the control wheat, and total dietary fiber, or TDF, which is more 
 6

than eight times higher than the control. RS wheat flour has been tested in applications in bread, where loaf quality was comparable to bread made with conventional wheat flour, and pasta, where it had the highest consumer preference rankings in tests carried out by a major consumer products company.

RS wheat flour is currently being tested in a range of additional bakery, ready-to-eat cereals and pasta products with industrial partners. We have many RS wheat lines that are being evaluated for optimal quality and agronomic characteristics.
Improved Shelf Life of Whole Grain Flour
 The USDA recommends that “at least one serving of grains per day must be whole grain-rich” due to evidence that a diet containing whole grains provides a multitude of benefits, including lower risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes. Despite these health benefits, consumption of whole grain products is negatively affected by the bitter and rancid flavors and odors that accumulate in whole wheat flour after milling. Our improved stability and flavor wheat lines greatly reduced the production of rancid and bitter compounds in aged whole grain flour. Whole wheat flour from these lines is being tested further for sensory characteristics and improved shelf life stability. This new trait could help improve the shelf life and flavor profile of whole grain products, thus reducing formulation costs and increasing consumer preference and palatability for whole grains.

Reduced Gluten Wheat
 
Many consumers are interested in reducing levels of gluten in their diet. Critically, for some, this is due to having Celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune disease that impacts many people worldwide with estimates from 1% in Europe to 3.5% in Mexico. Furthermore, a non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) impacts an estimated additional 6% of the population. Both CD and NCGS are characterized by sensitivity to dietary gluten. The only effective treatment of CD and NCGS requires removal of gluten sources from the diet. Since required adherence to a gluten-free diet is extremely difficult to accomplish, efforts to develop alternative approaches are needed.
 
Arcadia is developing a new wheat variety with reduced gluten levels. Our proprietary, non-GM wheat variety, developed using advanced screening and plant breeding techniques have reduced allergenic glutens and increased essential amino acids such as lysine, along with all the health benefits of high protein wheat.  This new variety is beneficial for both food and feed applications. We’re breeding the trait into commercial wheat varieties and working with food processors to give people a choice to enjoy higher quality wheat in the products they love while reducing gluten in their diet.
 

Nutritional Oils
 Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA) Oil
 Under a license agreement with Abbott, we developed a new source of vegetable oil with very high levels of gamma linolenic acid, or GLA, an omega-6 fatty acid. To our knowledge, our GLA safflower oil product has the highest concentration of GLA available in any plant oil at 65%; conventional plant oils range from 10 to 22% GLA. We can sell the oil in the United States to manufacturers of dietary supplements, nutritional supplements, medical foods, dog food, and other products. GLA safflower oil is also approved in Canada as a natural health product. Our key customers include significant participants in those markets, such as GNC, Lindora Nutrition, JumpStart MD and others.

GLA has multiple clinically-demonstrated nutritional and medical benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects, improving skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and healthy weight management. Multiple parties have expressed commercial interest in incorporating an enhanced GLA oil into their foods, dietary supplements, or medical products where conventional sources of GLA are not sufficiently concentrated to deliver amounts that are cost- and performance-effective.
 
Against a commercial target of 40% GLA concentration, we developed, deregulated and commercialized GLA safflower oil containing up to 75% GLA concentration in fewer than six years. This is significantly shorter timeline than the 13 years it takes, on average, to commercialize an agricultural biotechnology product, according to Phillips McDougall. We produce GLA safflower oil by contracting with farmers in Idaho and process the seed under contract with a manufacturer in California to make refined oil. We sell GLA safflower oil under the brand name, SONOVA, with multiple concentrations and formulations.
 
In January 2017 we received notification from the FDA that our GRAS petition (generally recognized as safe) for the use of SONOVA GLA in medical foods and nutritional beverages had been accepted, which means that we can now market and sell this product in a new market segment. In August 2017, the FDA published in the Federal Register a food additive regulation for the use of SONOVA GLA in dog food. These approvals and authorizations are generating additional revenue opportunities for our GLA business. In addition, a food additive petition for use of SONOVA GLA in cat food was filed in September 2017 and is currently pending. 
 
Arachidonic Acid (ARA) Oil 
 Arachidonic Acid (ARA) Oil has high levels of the omega 6 fatty acid ARA, which is a key ingredient in more than 90% of U.S. infant nutrition products. ARA contributes to healthy infant eye and brain development. We estimate the global market for ARA at $160 million and believe that our ARA product will cost significantly less than currently available sources of this essential omega 6 fatty acid.
 
Our ARA Oil is being developed under agreements with Abbott and DuPont Pioneer, each of which licensed intellectual property to us for this program. In exchange for licenses to intellectual property, these agreements provide product access rights to Abbott and DuPont Pioneer, as well as certain royalty payments on product sales to third parties.
 
We currently have safflower lines with oil compositions that meet our partner specifications for being direct replacements for current sources of ARA in infant nutrition products. We are evaluating additional near term market distribution opportunities with our downstream partners.
 
Agriculture Productivity Traits, the Yield and Stress Pipeline
 
In 2017, we evaluated by licensee and geography where regulatory advancement and adoption of our abiotic productivity traits among regulators was most promising and where a lack of historical progress in trait deregulation appeared likely to persist into the foreseeable future. In regions where regulators are cooperating with our licensees to progress field trials and other deregulation activities, we continue active monitoring and providing our technical support when and where needed to ensure full resource support for ultimate commercialization. Where near term progress was not likely, we proceeded to cancel such licenses and are evaluating alternative deregulation strategies. 
 
Arcadia is a recognized leader in the area of yield and abiotic stress and our business was built on the premise that mitigating the impact of environmental stresses, whether chronic or transient, would generate meaningful yield gains in the most important crops in the world. We believe our yield and stress pipeline holds significant promise, as evidenced by our internal data and data generated by our partners in rice, wheat, soy, corn and cotton varieties. The commercial value of these types of traits will be fully unlocked as the traits are introgressed into elite germplasm by breeding partners, tested broadly in the field under different environments and agricultural practices in order to obtain the approval for commercial sale by the relevant regulatory authorities.

The following table summarizes our current product pipeline in 2017:


Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) 
 
Our NUE technology enables plants to utilize nitrogen fertilizer much more efficiently than conventional plants. This allows crops to achieve significantly higher yields under normally applied levels of nitrogen fertilizer, or to achieve the same yields as conventional crops while using 30 to 50% less nitrogen fertilizer. 
 
Nitrogen fertilizer is a primary plant nutrient and key driver of crop yield. Nitrogen fertilizer is also a significant component of crop production cost. Plant Biotechnology Journal reported that only 30% to 50% of added nitrogen fertilizer is taken up by agricultural crops, with the remainder left unutilized and potentially becoming a significant environmental pollutant.
 
Our NUE technology platform was initially based on a trait discovered at the University of Alberta (Canada), and we hold an exclusive, global license to the technology for use in all crops, with unlimited sublicense rights. Efficacy of this NUE technology has recently been demonstrated in field-grown rice, wheat, and canola by multiple groups.  
 
The target crops and markets for NUE include all major agricultural crops and markets. Our NUE technology has now been incorporated, or is under evaluation by our commercial partners, in major global crops, including rice, wheat, cotton, sugarcane and eucalyptus. Field trial data to date in multiple major commodity crops has shown yield improvements greater than 10% attributable to our NUE trait. Additionally, NUE rice tests conducted by independent entities in multiple countries over multiple years have demonstrated that NUE rice lines produced significantly higher grain yield than controls at various nitrogen fertilizer rates. In the paddy low-land production environment, NUE rice lines showed an increase in grain yield of 29.5% at full nitrogen application rates when compared to the parental line. In the rainfed up-land production environment, the NUE rice lines demonstrated 33.8% grain increase at 50% nitrogen application rate.
 10

Water Use Efficiency and Drought Tolerance 
 
Our Water Use Efficiency (WUE) trait enables plants to better tolerate two distinct types of stress: reduced or inconsistent water availability, and severe drought. The WUE trait has been demonstrated to improve crop yield under conditions of episodic water stress and to help crops recover from severe drought conditions. A related but distinct technology, Drought Tolerance, helps plants maintain yields under conditions of prolonged water stress. 
 
Modern agriculture is highly water intensive, using approximately 70% of world water withdrawals, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO. UNESCO also estimates that future global agricultural water consumption will increase by about 19% by 2050 and could be even higher if the efficiency of agricultural production does not improve dramatically. The irregular availability of suitable water is one the leading causes of reduced crop yield globally. Loss due to drought in the United States, as reported to the USDA Risk Management Agency, averaged $4.1 billion per year from 2012 through 2016. 
 
Water-limiting conditions can result from prolonged drought, leading to severe reductions in crop yields, or can result from periodic dry conditions, leading to reduced crop yields. Whenever water limitations occur, economic losses and impairment of the food supply result. 
 
Our WUE trait technology was jointly discovered by researchers at the University of California, Davis and Technion—Israel Institute of Technology. We hold an exclusive, global license to the technology, with sublicense rights, for use in all crops. Greenhouse and field trials of our WUE traits have been completed in agronomic crops such as rice, wheat, cotton, peanuts and alfalfa. We are currently working with collaborators in rice, potato, sugarcane, cotton and multiple tree species.
 
Our Drought Tolerance (DT) technology was discovered by researchers at National Scientific and Technical Research Council (Argentina), and further developed by Bioceres, S.A. Verdeca, our joint venture with Bioceres, Inc., holds exclusive global rights and is developing and commercializing this technology in soybeans. 
 
Our Drought Tolerance technology is most advanced in soybeans. Multiple seasons of field trials in test germplasm in both North and South America have shown better or equal yield performance of the HB4 drought tolerant trait relative to controls. We expect the optimum performance of this trait will be in the drought stressed regions of South America.  Verdeca and seed company licensees are introgressing the trait into pre-commercial germplasm in Argentina to address this market. The Early Food Safety Evaluation process was completed in 2015 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the plant protein responsible for our Drought Tolerance trait. The trait has full approval for food safety and international commerce in Argentina (2015) and is pending approval in China. Regulatory approval application was submitted in 2016 to the FDA and the Agency completed its review in August 2017 thereby allowing for food and feed consumption in the US. USDA request for a Determination of Nonregulated Status was submitted in 2017 and is currently pending approval. Additionally, regulatory approval applications have been submitted in Uruguay and are pending final approval. Regulatory submissions were made in 2016 for import approval of Drought Tolerant HB4 soybeans into China. Further, we plan to submit for production approval in Brazil in 2018 and import approval in the European Union in 2018. 
 Salinity Tolerance 
 Our Salinity Tolerance trait allows plants to maintain yields under conditions of elevated salinity and is applicable to a wide range of crops, including wheat, rice, soybean, and cotton. The global cost of lost crop yield to salt-induced land degradation is estimated to be $27.3 billion per year according to the United Nations Natural Resources Forum. Of the current 230 million hectares of irrigated land, 45 million hectares, or about 20%, are salt-affected. Crops grown under salt-affected conditions may be inhibited in two ways. First, the presence of salt in the soil reduces the ability of the plant to take up water, leading to reductions in growth rate. Second, if excessive amounts of salt enter the plant, there can be injury to the cells, which may cause further reductions in growth. Modern agriculture is highly water intensive and the ability to manage crops in saline environments will reduce agricultural demand on critical fresh water supplies.
 11

Our most advanced Salinity Tolerance trait technology is based on technology from the University of Toronto, the University of California, Davis, and the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (Japan), all of which have granted us exclusive licenses for all crops. In addition, we are conducting research on additional salinity tolerance genes under a funded research agreement with the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID.
 
Target markets for the Salinity Tolerance trait are areas where water or soil salinity decrease crop yield. Such areas occur globally where irrigation is prevalent, where ground water supplies are salinized due to seawater intrusion and where soils are salinized due to mineral deposits. These conditions are common in North America, India, China, additional countries in Asia, Australia, and other major crop production countries. Our Salinity Tolerance trait has been licensed to partners in rice, wheat, cotton, and oilseeds. 
 
Crops with tolerance to soil and water salinity are in various phases of development with our primary licensee and partner for the Salinity Tolerance trait technology. Our partner previously tested the most promising rice lines with our trait in a field in which controlled amounts of salt were applied to the replicated plots. In 2015, a field trial was executed on naturally high saline farmlands in India, where grain yields typically are very low, and we saw results similar to those in prior trials. Our partner has developed wheat lines that show significant salinity tolerance under greenhouse conditions, with some lines outperforming the controls by more than 30%, and additional wheat lines are in development to expand the scope of our partner’s first greenhouse evaluations. For salt tolerant cotton, our partner is preparing to conduct outdoor field trials in India.
 
Wheat Yield
 
Our non-transgenic wheat yield program, initially supported by USDA SBIR, aims to increase yield in wheat using TILLING, a non-GM reverse genetics tool, to identify novel alleles of candidate wheat yield genes in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. These alleles are being evaluated for the ability to alter wheat architecture and improve yield in the field. As a non-GM technology, products from TILLING can rapidly advance to commercialization and do not face market or regulatory restrictions. With a conservative 5% increase in yield, the yearly value creation to the U.S. farmer is estimated at over $30 per hectare. In addition, the value of higher yielding wheat varieties to a seed company arising from this research in the U.S. alone is more than $40 million annually. By incorporating favorable alleles of plant architecture genes into a commercial wheat breeding program, we believe we can make a significant contribution to improving yield in this vital food crop.
Herbicide Tolerance 
 Our Herbicide Tolerance program is currently focused on wheat. We have developed a non-GM source of tolerance to glyphosate, a widely used non-selective herbicide. We believe that the discoveries under this program are applicable to other chemistries and are likely to result in similar opportunities in other major crops.
 
According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications, or ISAAA, from 1996 to 2013, herbicide tolerant crops consistently occupied the largest planting area of biotech crops. In 2013 alone, herbicide tolerant crops occupied 99.4 million hectares, or 57%, of the 175.2 million hectares of biotech crops planted globally. For the first 17 years of commercialization (1996 to 2012), benefits from herbicide tolerant crops were valued at $47.7 billion, which accounted for 41% of global biotech crop value. For 2012 alone, herbicide tolerant crops were valued at $6.6 billion or 35% of global biotech crop value.
 
Our Herbicide Tolerance technology is in Phase 3 of development and was developed using our non-GM TILLING platform. This work is fully funded by a collaborator who has the option to obtain a non-exclusive commercial license to this trait in certain countries. We retain the right to further license this technology to additional collaborators in major wheat markets.
 
Testing results have shown tolerance in multiple lines to glyphosate application. This tolerance may be sufficient to control many weed species in certain wheat production areas. Individual glyphosate tolerant wheat lines are being combined via plant breeding to combine additional sources of tolerance and create products with increasing levels of tolerance.

Technology Evaluation
 Our technology program teams include scientists who are leaders in their respective fields. These teams contribute to the initial evaluation of new opportunities and are responsible for development of technologies brought onboard or developed in-house. Each of our technology programs involves multiple gene, trait and crop targets, and our process focuses on rapid development of the most promising combinations. In the development of any particular trait, we carry out a series of steps including the direct evaluation of target gene function and the specific evaluation of results in key representative crop species. While common core scientific services are provided by functional groups, the technology program team manages overall progress and remains directly involved throughout the development cycle, internally as well as externally with our collaborators.
 
GM and Non-GM Product Development Platforms 
 Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes (TILLING)—Non-GM Traits. Our advanced breeding TILLING platform enables us to develop value-added crops without the use of GM methods. The TILLING platform is managed by a dedicated team of scientists able to apply TILLING to multiple crops with complex genomes. TILLING technology was originally invented by a member of our science team and utilizes specialized laboratory equipment to carry out high-throughput allele screening of DNA samples from genetic diversity populations created in major crops. Our populations include wheat, rice, soybean, and canola. These populations include numerous native and induced gene function alterations, which can be discovered and evaluated rapidly at low cost and with minimal regulatory requirements. While the TILLING approach is also practiced elsewhere, we believe that the combination of our background in the technology as the first to apply TILLING to crop plants such as wheat and tomato, and our highly refined skills in developing and screening genetic diversity in plant populations makes us a leader in commercial applications of TILLING.
 
Transformation—GM Traits. For projects involving GM traits, the genetic construct for insertion into plants is designed and built by our relevant program team, and then the gene transfer step is accomplished by our plant transformation functional group. This group has developed a complete physical and methodological infrastructure at our laboratory facility in Davis, California to efficiently transfer genetic materials into key crop species. Our team has demonstrated transformation capabilities in all primary and some secondary agricultural crops, including rice (japonica, indica and NERICA types), wheat, corn, canola, safflower, barley, sorghum, alfalfa, tomato, potato, tobacco and grapes. 
 
Genome Editing. Our genome editing pipeline includes a cross disciplinary group of experienced molecular biologists and plant transformation experts with demonstrated capabilities in using both biological and physical methods of plant transformation. Our expertise in both transformation and TILLING in the application of genome editing has helped to accelerate new product development.
 
In 2017, we obtained a license for research purposes for CRISPR- Cas9 from the Board Institute of MIT and Harvard. We believe this is the leading gene editing technology and using this technology will accelerate product development.
 
Controlled Growth Operations. Our controlled growth operations group manages our growth chamber facilities, where plants are grown under precisely controlled conditions, and our greenhouse facility, consisting of approximately 26,000 square feet of high quality greenhouse space, which are both at our headquarters in Davis, California. The controlled growth operations group uses these facilities to manage plant experiments and grow-outs under rigorously controlled conditions. They also carry out the initial seed increases and first stages of plant breeding for some projects. For certain projects, such as those relating to oil quality and high fiber Resistant Starch wheat, this group also manages crop pre-breeding programs to develop plant varieties for the production of commercial products.
 
13

Field Trials and Commercial Production. Our trait evaluation and development group is based in Davis, California and manages remote field operations in American Falls, Idaho and Brawley, California. The group conducts field trials throughout the United States with specialized contractors, and elsewhere globally with our collaborators and joint venture partners. The trait evaluation and development group has extensive field and specialized statistical analytical capabilities that we deploy to support their field trial execution and data analysis internally and with our collaborators.
 
Our agricultural operations group manages efficacy and regulatory field trials and, in the case of GLA safflower, commercial crop production. Late-stage field trials are intended to develop extensive data on a limited number of potential commercial plant varieties. These trials may be used to test new varieties developed by our collaborators containing our traits, and to test our own commercial varieties for oil quality and grain quality programs. Similarly, regulatory trials develop data for use in submissions for regulatory review and may involve plant varieties developed by our collaborators or our own oil quality and grain quality programs.
 
Regulatory Data Generation. Our Analytical Services and Regulatory Science group is located in Davis, California and provides automated DNA preparations, genomic blot analyses, lipid profiling, metabolomics and protein purification services and develops data for use in product selection and validation, certification of SONOVA product specifications, and regulatory submissions. These data support regulatory submissions and provide core trait regulatory packages to our collaborators for use in their crop-specific regulatory applications. 
Biological Materials Inventory and Tracking. Our proprietary Pedigree and Inventory Management System, or PIMS, tracks the genetic, phenotypic and location information for all our plant materials. PIMS encompasses genetic elements such as genes and promoters, GM seeds and plant material received by us, as well as seeds and plants developed by us and used in trait development. The performance of our plant materials is recorded through a variety of laboratory and field observations, and the data are stored within PIMS. The location of all plant materials is tracked throughout the plant life cycle. This includes specific seeds planted within a specific plot of a specific field trial, harvest, seed storage location and use by, or distribution of plant material to, our collaborators or elsewhere. PIMS interfaces with our Biotechnology Quality Management System, or BQMS, to manage all movement and release of regulated GM plant materials. This ensures that all of our plant materials are accounted for, tracked and inventoried, which enables us to maintain control over and documentation of all plant materials.
Regulatory Compliance and Stewardship
 Our regulatory management team provides regulatory services for all of product development programs, as well as joint ventures and selected collaborations. These services include establishing standard operating procedures and best practices, completing regulatory permits and monitoring regulatory and stewardship compliance for all products at all stages. Our regulatory team includes key employees who are directly responsible for leading all global regulatory agency interactions and providing tactical and strategic regulatory direction. Our team collectively has more than 30 years of direct involvement in the development and approvals of GM crops. The key member of our regulatory team was responsible for completing the first FDA and USDA deregulation of a GM whole food. The interactions and processes associated with these first USDA and FDA processes established benchmarks for the regulation of GM products that remain applicable today.
 Our regulatory management and compliance activities encompass three broad categories: deregulation, stewardship, and authorization. In the United States, these activities are regulated by various government agencies, including the USDA, the FDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Our regulatory team has completed significant regulatory activities (new dietary ingredient review, food additive regulation, GRAS notice and GM food consultation) with the FDA Division of Dietary Supplement Programs, with the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, with the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine and with the Health Canada Natural Health Products Directorate.
 14

Deregulation 
 Our business is subject to regulations related to agriculture, food and the environment. Plant products produced using GM technology are subject to laws and regulations in countries where the plants are grown and in countries where the GM plant-derived food and feed are consumed by humans or animals. Commodity products utilizing our GM traits may require approvals in multiple countries prior to commercialization.
 U.S. Regulatory Agencies:
 U.S. Department of Agriculture. We must obtain USDA authorizations and permits in order to conduct the field releases of GM regulated materials that are necessary to advance the development of GM crops. Obtaining such authorizations and permits is generally routine and delays impacting the planned movement or release of GM material are uncommon. The USDA provides detailed regulations and guidance for obtaining a “Determination of Deregulated Status,” which authorizes the commercial and uncontained growing of GM plants. For regulated GM plants, the USDA requires that a company petition the agency to demonstrate that the product is unlikely to pose a risk. Based on the information provided, the USDA prepares an Environmental Assessment (EA) and/or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in order to make its determination. These procedures afford the public an opportunity to submit written comments on the draft EA or EIS for consideration by the USDA before the final version of the EA or EIS is published. For any GM plant product, there may be delays or requests for additional information based on the USDA’s review or the public comments. As of February 2018, USDA has reached 123 Determinations of Nonregulated Status. Submissions received by the USDA from all applicants prior to 2011 averaged more than 3 years for approval. Since then, the USDA has significantly shortened the time to approval.
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is responsible for food safety under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA recommended in its 1992 Statement of Policy: Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties that developers of GM plant products consult with the agency about the safety of GM products under development. In 1996, the FDA provided additional guidance to the industry on procedures for these consultations. These procedures require a developer intending to commercialize a food or feed product derived from a GM plant to first meet with the agency to identify and discuss relevant safety, nutritional and other regulatory issues regarding the product. Subsequently, the developer submits to the FDA a scientific and regulatory assessment supporting proposed product safety. The FDA evaluates the submission and engages with the developer to resolve any questions, requests for additional data or other informational requirements. Once the FDA has determined that all requirements have been satisfied, the FDA concludes the consultation process by issuing a letter to the developer acknowledging completion of the consultation process with the addition of the product to the list of completed consultations on the FDA website. The completed consultation acknowledges product safety for use as food and feed. To date, over 150 GM products have completed this process. This process may have delays if the FDA requires additional data and information for its consultation and to resolve any questions the FDA may have. The FDA completed 21 consultations from 2015 to 2017, with consultation time periods in 2017 ranging from 11 to 15 months and averaging just over one year from first submission to conclusion.
 Environmental Protection Agency. Certain products may also be regulated by the EPA, including plants that contain a plant-incorporated protectant, such as a pesticides or herbicide, or plants engineered to be treated with industrial chemicals.
 International Deregulation:
When products from GM crops are expected to be exported from the United States, commercialization of such crops in the United States will require approvals in those countries into which the crops or derivative products, such as grain, oil or meal, will be exported. The laws and regulations for GM plant products are well defined in most commercially significant countries, including Australia, South American countries, India, China, several African countries and the European Union. Typically, our collaborators are responsible for obtaining all regulatory permits and approvals relevant to product development and commercialization in their licensed countries and for generating crop and transformation event-specific data required by their countries of interest. We provide basic safety data on trait expression products in accordance with generally accepted standards. In addition, we may serve as a regulatory consultant and participate in the design of regulatory protocols, data generation and development of detailed regulatory submissions. In certain countries, we may develop strategic business relationships or employ independent consultants with country-specific knowledge and expertise to support and obtain required approvals.

Stewardship 
 Stewardship, or the careful and responsible management of assets, forms the foundation of our regulatory compliance programs associated with GM plants. Our stewardship framework for GM plants is defined by government regulations and related internal policies and practices. In previous years, Arcadia’s Biotechnology Quality Management System (now identified as ABQMS) was developed by us and then audited/certified by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Biotechnology Regulatory Service (APHIS BRS). Recently, USDA updated its BQMS program renaming it the Biotechnology Quality Management Support Program, discontinuing the mandatory auditing/certification standard.
 Our ABQMS program was developed to address all conditions required under USDA authority to ensure containment of regulated plant material. The ABQMS includes standard operating procedures, or SOPs, recording and reporting forms, instructions for managing all compliance related activities, and training requirements for all individuals handling GM plant materials. SOPs are highly detailed and consider all elements of each relevant activity or process. Each field trial site is accompanied by a Field Compliance Guide and Record (GUIDE) containing multiple SOPs and associated forms for each activity. For example, a GM wheat trial requires 19 SOPs and associated verification forms. A GUIDE is completed for each regulated field trial and serves as a completed record to support compliance with government regulations. Example copies of the GUIDE have been provided to our collaborators for use in other countries where they conduct GM field trials.
 Our ABQMS is audited annually by our compliance manager and previously by an independent auditor trained and supervised by the USDA. Since our ABQMS program was first recognized by the USDA in 2011, each annual independent audit conducted by USDA until discontinuation of their audit program confirmed that our program was functioning as intended. Our ABQMS manager has attended USDA BQMS training programs at the request of the USDA to assist in training personnel at other companies and organizations and to share our experience and the SOPs that form the basis of our program.
 Compliance with the specific parameters of regulatory requirements is only one element of stewardship. Additional activities within each functional group throughout the company are integral to the overall stewardship program. Each of our employees is trained on, and must comply with, relevant stewardship guidelines as defined and described in our ABQMS.
 Authorization 
 The USDA APHIS Biotechnology Regulatory Service (BRS) has legal and regulatory authority over the movement and release of GM plants and seeds. “Movement” includes movement of regulated GM plant material between states and the importation of regulated GM plant material into the United States. “Release” includes field trials of any size and any other use of regulated GM plant material outside of contained greenhouses.
 We have obtained more than 200 authorizations from the BRS for the movement, importation or release of GM plants under development. General and specific conditions to maintain containment during all activities associated with the movement or release are a requirement of each authorization. These conditions are defined, applied and recorded in the GUIDE following our ABQMS program.
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on patents and other proprietary right protections, including trade secrets and contractual protection of our proprietary know-how and confidential information, to preserve our competitive position.
 As of December 31, 2017, we owned or exclusively controlled 137 issued patents and 48 pending patent applications worldwide. As of this date, we owned 10 and exclusively in-licensed 16 U.S. patents and we owned eight U.S. patent applications relating to our trait technologies and business methods. Also, as of this date, we owned 12 and exclusively in-licensed 98 foreign patents and owned 32 and exclusively in-licensed nine pending foreign patent applications. With respect to all of the foregoing patent assets, our exclusive licenses afford us control over the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents and patent applications. These numbers do not include in-licensed patents for which we either do not have exclusive rights (such as certain enabling technology licenses), or for which we have exclusive rights only in a limited field of use or do not control prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents.
 16

As of December 31, 2017, we had eight registered trademarks in the United States. As of this date, we also had eight registered trademarks in various other countries.  We also have entered into in-license agreements enabling the use and commercialization of our traits, including NUE, WUE and Salinity Tolerance, and certain products that we have commercialized or are under development, including GLA safflower oil and ARA safflower oil. Under these licensing arrangements, we are obligated to pay royalty fees on sublicense revenue and net product sales ranging between low single digit percentages and percentages in the mid-teens, subject in certain cases to aggregate dollar caps. The exclusivity and royalty provisions of these agreements are generally tied to the expiration of underlying patents. After the termination of these provisions, we and our collaborators may continue to produce and sell products utilizing the technology under the expired patents. While third parties thereafter may develop products using the technology under the expired patents, in many cases, we have incremental patent rights covering our most important technologies, which we believe mitigate the impact of the expiration of these patents, or the related exclusivity provisions, on our business. We also have numerous in-licenses relating to enabling technologies utilized in our development programs, such as transformation methods (e.g., Japan Tobacco, DuPont Pioneer), genome editing tools (e.g., Broad Institute), promoters (e.g., Corteva Agriscience formerly known as Dow AgroSciences, Louisiana State University) and selectable marker technologies (e.g., Bayer). These in-licenses are non-exclusive and include some combination of upfront and annual license fees, milestone fees, and commercial royalty obligations consisting of low percentages or a low dollar per acre fee.
 Below is a summary of those in-license agreements that we believe are most significant for our more advanced product development programs.
 University of Alberta. We hold an exclusive license from University of Alberta to the patent portfolio that formed the basis of our NUE program, which began in 2002. In exchange for an upfront license fee and royalties on sublicense revenues and net product sales (which are capped at an aggregate amount in the mid-seven figures), and subject to the University’s right to perform academic research using the technology, we exclusively control all research, development, commercialization, and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops.
 Blue Horse Labs. In conjunction with a sponsored research and development agreement entered into in 2003, we obtained an exclusive license from Blue Horse Labs, an affiliate entity of our majority stockholder, Moral Compass Corporation, for technology related to several of our development programs. Under the sponsored research and development agreement, Blue Horse Labs has an ownership right in patents covering technology that was developed using Blue Horse Labs funds, including certain NUE and GLA safflower patents. In the corresponding license agreement, in exchange for a single-digit royalty on net revenues and management of all aspects of the patent portfolio, we exclusively control all research, development, commercialization, and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops.
 University of California, Davis. Our WUE technology was developed under an exclusive option agreement with the University of California, Davis, pursuant to which we exercised our right to secure an exclusive license in 2010. We also hold an exclusive license from University of California, Davis, to the patent portfolio that forms the basis of our Salinity Tolerance program. In exchange for an upfront license fee, license maintenance fees, and royalties on sublicense revenues and net product sales, we exclusively control all for-profit research, development, commercialization, and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops. 
 University of Toronto. We hold an exclusive license from University of Toronto to the patent portfolio that forms the basis of our Salinity Tolerance program. In exchange for an upfront license fee, a royalty on revenues, and payment of all costs associated with the patent portfolio, and subject to the University’s right to use the technology for research and teaching purposes, we exclusively control all for-profit research, development, commercialization and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops.
 Abbott. We entered into a license and development agreement with Abbott in 2003 under which we have been granted limited exclusive rights to Abbott’s portfolio of U.S. and foreign patents relating to the development of plant-based sources of GLA, ARA and essential fatty acids. Under this agreement, we provide Abbott with preferential access to commercial products from our GLA and ARA safflower programs, as well as the right to receive royalty payments on product sales to third parties, in exchange for the licenses to Abbott’s intellectual property rights.

Key Collaborations 
 Since our founding in 2002, we have established numerous trait collaborations and have developed close relationships with industry-leading seed and consumer product companies. Our partnerships with global strategic seed and consumer product players enable us to further participate in the development and commercialization of innovative products that promise to play significant roles in improving global crop efficiency and enhancing human health. The results of these collaborations directly feed innovation and drive the progress of our ongoing programs. Moreover, the expertise and opportunities created by these collaborations represent important assets to our business. While our collaboration-focused business model has resulted in numerous strategically significant relationships, below is a summary of selected collaborative partnerships that we view as key to the achievement of our near-term and mid-term business objectives.
Mahyco
 We have multiple agreements with Mahyco covering numerous programs, using our most advanced traits in multiple major crops, and have been working with Mahyco as a key partner since 2007. Our agreements with Mahyco in NUE rice and salt tolerant rice are in advanced stages of development.
 Under our various agreements relating to our NUE, WUE, and Salinity Tolerance traits, Mahyco has exclusive research and commercial rights in all licensed geographies and must timely meet certain diligence milestones in order to maintain their exclusivity. Each of our agreements with Mahyco includes an upfront technology access fee, technical and regulatory milestone fees, and, once products utilizing our traits are commercialized, we are entitled to receive a portion of the commercial value of seeds sold by Mahyco incorporating our traits. Rights to new intellectual property developed under an agreement are owned by the inventing party or parties.
 In December 2017, we reached agreement with Mahyco for the return of licensed geographies and crops for certain WUE, NUE & Salinity Tolerance traits where Mahyco either lacks the resources or expertise to effectively progress trait deregulation and commercialization. In addition, for other geographies where Mahyco has progressed trait development but does not possess the familiarity with, or influence on, the regulatory environment to affect deregulation, we have agreed we will endeavor to jointly pursue new incountry licensees we believe to be equipped and capable to achieve trait deregulation and commercialization. For those licenses terminated prior to December 31, 2017, the remaining balance of the upfront license fees previously deferred for such agreements has been released and recognized as revenue into the fourth quarter of 2017 totaling $528,000.
 Vilmorin & Cie (Limagrain)
 We selected Limagrain as our strategic partner and collaborator in wheat—the world’s largest crop by area grown and the third most valuable at $186.4 billion annual value—due to their position as the leading global breeder and marketer of wheat seeds. In 2009, we executed an agreement with Limagrain under which we partnered to develop and commercialize NUE wheat in all countries of the world except Australia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Under our agreement, Limagrain has exclusive research and commercial rights in all licensed geographies except North America and South America, in which we retained co-exclusive rights, and Limagrain must timely meet diligence milestones to maintain exclusivity. Our agreement with Limagrain includes an upfront technology access fee, annual maintenance fees, and technical and regulatory milestone fees, and once an NUE wheat product is commercialized, we are entitled to receive a portion of the commercial value of the trait in the marketplace. We and Limagrain have since coordinated with collaborators in Australia to align development efforts in NUE wheat on a global basis.
 Contemporaneously with Limagrain’s $25.0 million equity investment in our company, in 2010 we formed Limagrain Cereal Seeds LLC, a joint venture company focused on the development and commercialization of improved wheat seed in North America, of which a U.S. wholly owned subsidiary of Limagrain owns 65% and we own 35%. 
 18

On March 31, 2017, the Company and Vilmorin USA (“VUSA”) entered into a noncash exchange agreement, whereby the Company transferred to VUSA the Company’s entire membership interest in Limagrain Cereal Seeds LLC (“LCS”) and VUSA transferred to the Company 92,195 shares of the Company’s common stock held by Limagrain. The Company recorded the retirement of the shares using the cost method, resulting in an equity reclassification between common stock par value and additional paid-in capital.
 Bioceres
 In 2012, we partnered with Bioceres, an Argentina-based technology company, to form Verdeca LLC, a U.S.-based joint venture company engaged in the development and deregulation of soybean traits, of which we own 50%. We selected Bioceres as our partner in soybeans—the world’s fourth largest crop by area grown and the fourth most valuable at $119.0 billion annual value—due to their desirable trait portfolio, their presence in key South American markets, and the significant presence of large soybean growers in their ownership structure.
 Our joint venture agreement provides for each of the joint venture partners to license its trait technologies to Verdeca for use in soybeans, with product development and regulatory efforts equitably divided and managed by us and Bioceres under stand-alone service agreements that are executed annually. The first product in the Verdeca pipeline is a drought and abiotic stress tolerance trait that has already completed extensive validation trials and is now in the regulatory phase of development. This trait has been demonstrated to confer as high as a 14% yield advantage over conventional soybeans grown under the same suboptimal conditions. In April 2015, Verdeca received the first regulatory approval of its stress tolerance trait in soybeans in Argentina. This is the world’s first regulatory approval of an abiotic stress tolerance trait in soybeans, which we believe is an important initial step in pursuing additional regulatory approvals that Verdeca intends to seek in multiple geographies globally. Verdeca has successfully negotiated favorable market access in South America through established players and is working on adding market channel partners in the United States, India, and China.
 In addition to those agreements with Bioceres directly associated with Verdeca, we also have negotiated exclusive access to Bioceres’ drought and abiotic stress tolerance trait for use globally, outside of South America, in wheat. Our agreement with Bioceres provides for sharing of trait value once a product is commercialized.
 Dow AgroSciences
 In December 2015, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Dow AgroSciences to develop and commercialize new yield traits and trait stacks in corn. In December 2017, after two years of work, the program had not met its primary performance characteristics sufficient to warrant additional investment. Instead, the parties agreed to terminate the strategic collaboration in favor of pursuing higher value, nearer term opportunities in the health and nutrition trait market. 
 In August 2017, we announced entry into a new strategic collaboration with Dow AgroSciences to jointly develop and commercialize a breakthrough improved wheat quality trait in North America. The collaboration leverages our TILLING platform with Dow AgroSciences’ enabling technology platforms, high-quality elite germplasm and global commercial channels.
 Under the collaboration, the companies will further develop and commercialize an improved wheat quality trait, which has completed initial field trials and is advancing to next-stage field trials. Dow AgroSciences will introgress Arcadia’s trait into its proprietary elite germplasm lines and manage all aspects related to the trait commercialization. Certain development costs will be co-funded under the collaboration agreement, and we will share in the commercial value resulting from products produced.

Scientific Advisory Board 
 We maintain a scientific advisory board consisting of the members identified below. Our scientific advisory board meets on a quarterly basis and is comprised of industry and academic experts that have extensive experience in the analysis, research and development, and commercialization of biotech plants, including experience relating to discovery, transformation, and field trials. We consult with our scientific advisory board on a variety of matters pertaining to our current and future pipeline of products in development, including, for example, trait selection and development, transformation and TILLING methodologies, field trials, regulatory matters, and intellectual property evaluation.
 We currently have a scientific advisory board that consists of three members as follows:
 Vicki Chandler, Ph.D. is Dean of Natural Sciences at Minerva Schools at Keck Graduate Institute, a new undergraduate liberal arts college. Prior to joining Minerva, she was Chief Program Officer, Science at the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. She studied biochemistry for her undergraduate and doctoral degrees at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, San Francisco, respectively. She then pursued postdoctoral research at Stanford University in maize genetics and was on the faculty at the University of Oregon and the University of Arizona. Dr. Chandler’s research on paramutation, an epigenetic process, has implications not only for maize, which she used for the majority of her research, but also for animal and human genetics and genetic diseases. Dr. Chandler has been President of the Genetics Society of America, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and a member of the National Science Board. Her many honors include the Presidential Young Investigator Award, Searle Scholar Award, and American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow. She has served on advisory boards and panels for the National Research Council, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and National Institutes of Health. Dr. Chandler has chaired numerous conferences and served on the editorial boards of several journals, including Genetics, Plant Physiology, PNAS, and Science.
 Luca Comai, Ph.D. is a professor of plant biology at the University of California, Davis Genome Center. Dr. Comai’s lab is involved in two areas pertinent to breeding. In the first, they study genome regulation, hybridization, and heterosis responses in chromosome copy number variants and interspecific hybridization. In the second, they develop methods and resources for functional genomic discovery, including TILLING, which allows targeted inactivation of genes in crop plants. The research combines plant genetics and genomics with the use of next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics and genome editing to identify genes responsible for traits of interest as well as to discover and use natural and induced variation. Dr. Comai is known for his pioneering work creating glyphosate tolerant crops, and as a founding scientist in Calgene Pacific, Targeted Growth, Inc. and Tilligen. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
 Peter Quail, Ph.D. is a professor of plant and microbial biology at the University of California, Berkeley where he also serves as Research Director of the Plant Gene Expression Center (U.S. Department of Agriculture/Albany, California). Dr. Quail has been a pioneer in the study of phytochromes, photoreceptor proteins that play a major regulatory role in plant growth and development. Dr. Quail was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2004, as a Fellow of the American Association of Science in 2004, and was the recipient of the Stephen Hales Prize, American Society of Plant Biologists, 2008. He received a B.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Sydney, Australia.
Competition 
 The markets for seed traits and agricultural biotechnology products are highly competitive, and we face significant direct and indirect competition in several aspects of our business. Competition for improving plant genetics comes from conventional and advanced plant breeding techniques, as well as from the development of advanced biotechnology traits. Other potentially competitive sources of improvement in crop yields include improvements in crop protection chemicals, fertilizer formulations, farm mechanization, other biotechnology, and information management. Programs to improve genetics and chemistry are generally concentrated within a relatively small number of large companies, while non-genetic approaches are underway with broader set of companies.
 20

In general, we believe that our competitors generally fall into the following categories:
  
• | Specialty health and nutrition ingredient companies: In response to the growing consumer demand for healthier food alternatives, a number of agricultural and food based companies are augmenting their product and market strategies to bring new quality food ingredients to market. Calyxt, Inc. (formerly known as Cellectis Plant Sciences, Inc) is an agriculture biotechnology company that has a similar strategy as ours and is using gene editing technology to create healthier specialty food ingredients and agriculturally advantageous food crops.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Large Agricultural Biotechnology, Seed, and Chemical Companies: According to Phillips McDougall, the leading 6 seed and trait companies as a group invested $3.6 billion in seed and trait research and development in 2013. This includes conventional and advanced plant breeding, as well as biotechnology trait development. According to Phillips McDougall, only a limited number of companies have been actively involved in new trait discovery, development, and commercialization: Monsanto, DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, BASF, Bayer, Dow, KWS, and Genective (a joint venture between KWS and Limagrain). Many of these companies have substantially larger budgets for gene discovery, research, development, and product commercialization than we do. Some of these companies also have substantial resources and experience managing the regulatory process for new GM seed traits. Each of Monsanto, DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Dow, and Bayer, which accounted for 85% of the 2013 seed trait research and development spend noted above, also have significant chemical crop protection background and businesses. The trait pipelines of these companies are heavily weighted toward biotic stress traits, although they also have significant programs aimed at development of abiotic stress traits. While these companies have internal programs that may compete with our own, they also seek new traits externally and, as such, some of them either currently are, or may in the future be, our collaborators.

• | Trait Research and Development Companies: There are a number of companies that specialize in research and development of agricultural yield and product quality traits, and we believe that a dozen or more companies, including Yield 10, Arista, Benson Hill Biosystems, Evogene and Keygene, among others, are competitors in our field. We believe that these companies typically focus on a limited number of traits, and do not generally have the product development and regulatory infrastructure necessary to bring traits to market. Therefore, they typically license trait technologies to large industry players with in-house development and regulatory capabilities at a relatively early stage of development. In the development of nutritional traits using non-GM methods, companies like Calyxt and Arista Cereal Technologies are competitors who are also developing quality traits in wheat and other crops.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Companies Focused on the Development and Commercialization of Microbial Crop Enhancements: The use of microbial products to enhance crop performance via application to soil, seed, or to crops directly is an area where increased research and development activity has been underway for the past decade or more. We believe that there are more than 20 companies of varying size working in this space. There have been a number of acquisitions, including Becker Underwood by BASF, and joint collaborations in this space but multiple independent companies remain, including Verdesian, Marrone Bioinnovations, Biagro Agrinos, Indigo Agriculture, and Bioconsortia. While these companies could be considered to compete with us as their products seek to improve crop yields, we believe that such products and our traits may be additive, or synergistic, to our future products in terms of increasing crop yields.

• | Companies Focused on Farming Data Management, or Precision Agriculture: Within the past several years there has been a rapid increase in technologies and companies focused on acquiring, analyzing, and acting upon data in ways that may improve farm economics via increased crop yield and more efficient management of crop production inputs. Technical approaches include weather prediction and monitoring, high-density field and crop imaging systems, precision field soil and yield mapping, and others. Companies focusing on this space include Climate Corporation (acquired by Monsanto), Granular (acquired by DuPont), Farmers Business Network, Farmers Edge, Trimble, Planet Labs, Ceres Imaging, Blue River Technologies, and others. While these products are potentially competitive with us for increasing crop yields, we believe that certain of these products could also be additive or synergistic with our traits.

• | Agricultural Research Universities and Institutions: Given the global importance of agriculture, numerous agricultural research universities and institutions around the world focus on basic and applied research aimed at increasing crop yield. Most of this publicly funded research is focused on basic research. Many public research programs aim to understand basic biological processes and do not necessarily engage in further development and commercialization of discovered traits. While these programs are potentially competitive with us, we view them primarily as sources of innovation that is fully compatible with our business model. We have an established track record of working closely and effectively with public research programs, including a number from the U.S., Canada, Bangladesh, Japan, Australia, Ireland, and elsewhere.

 We believe that we are uniquely positioned at the nexus of basic research and commercial product development. Unlike many companies in our space, we generally do not compete in the area of basic research. Our focus is on development and validation and, therefore, we provide a value-added link by which basic research can be brought to market. While internal programs at the largest seed and technology companies are competitive with ours in some cases, we are technology providers to some of these companies, and we have numerous collaborations with many of them. To remain competitive, we are pursuing multiple strategies, including further building our non-GM pipeline of new technologies, increasing the scope and range of our field testing activities, and continuing to protect our intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions globally.
 Research and Development 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 23 full-time employees dedicated to research and development, five of whom are development and field personnel focused on demonstration and research field trials. Our research and development team has technical expertise in molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, genetic engineering, analytical chemistry, and plant physiology. Our research and development activities are conducted principally at our Davis, California facility, with ongoing field trials conducted in American Falls, Idaho; Brawley, California, Yuma, Arizona; and numerous other locations throughout the United States, as well as locations managed by our collaborators worldwide. We have made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in research and development. Our research and development expenses were $7.4 million and $8.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 42 full-time employees, of whom 5 hold Ph.D. degrees. Approximately 23 employees are engaged in research and development activities, two in regulatory management, and 17 in management, operations, accounting/finance, legal and administration. We consider our employee relations to be good. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement.
Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Davis, California, in a facility consisting of approximately 20,775 square feet of office, laboratory and growth chamber space under a lease which was set to expire on June 30, 2018 and has been extended pursuant to an option to renew the lease for an additional three-year term. This facility accommodates research and development, operations, analytical services, regulatory and administrative activities.  Our administrative offices in Phoenix, Arizona, consist of 2,976 square feet under a lease that expires on June 30, 2018 and accommodate our finance, legal and other administrative activities, as well as sales and marketing activities for our SONOVA products. We lease greenhouse space and farm land for agricultural use in Northern California as well as farmland in Idaho. We also lease office and warehouse space in Idaho under a lease that expires on December 31, 2021.  Our Seattle research location was closed in March 2017.
 We believe that our leased facilities are adequate to meet our current needs and that, if needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations.
