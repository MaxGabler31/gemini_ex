ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
OVERVIEW
We are the largest branded marketer in North America of apparel exclusively for babies and young children. We own two of the most highly recognized and most trusted brand names in the children's apparel industry, Carter's and OshKosh B'gosh (or "OshKosh"), and a leading baby and young child lifestyle brand, Skip Hop.
Established in 1865, our Carter's brand is recognized and trusted by consumers for high-quality apparel for children in sizes newborn to eight and accessories.

Established in 1895, OshKosh is a well-known brand, trusted by consumers for apparel for children in sizes newborn to 14, with a focus on playclothes for toddlers and young children, and accessories. 
We acquired the Skip Hop brand in February 2017. Established in 2003, the Skip Hop brand takes durable childhood necessities, and re-thinks, re-energizes, and re-imagines them to produce higher value, superior quality, and top-performance goods for parents, babies, and toddlers. 
We believe our brands provide a complementary product offering and aesthetic, and are each uniquely positioned in the marketplace. In the approximately $20 billion baby and young children's apparel market ages zero to seven in the U.S., our Carter's brand has the #1 position with approximately 15% of market share and our OshKosh brand has approximately 3% market share.
We market high-quality products at an attractive value proposition for consumers, and offer multiple product categories, including baby, sleepwear, playclothes, hardline goods and related accessories. Our multi-channel global business model -- which includes retail store, e-commerce, and wholesale sales channels - enables us to reach a broad range of consumers around the world. As of December 30, 2017, our channels included approximately 830 stores in the United States, 179 stores in Canada, 41 stores in Mexico, over 17,000 wholesale locations in the United States (including department stores, national chain stores, specialty stores and discount retailers), our eCommerce sites in the United States, Canada, and China, as well as our other international wholesale, licensing, and online channels.
We have extensive experience in the young children’s apparel and accessories market and focus on delivering products that satisfy our consumers’ needs. Our long-term growth strategy is focused on: 

• | providing the best value and experience in young children's apparel and accessories;


• | extending the reach of our brands by improving the convenience of shopping for our products in the United States and our omni-channel experience;


• | expanding our international operations; and


• | improving profitability by strengthening distribution and direct-sourcing capabilities, as well as inventory management disciplines.

At the beginning of fiscal 2017, we combined our Carter’s Retail and OshKosh Retail operating segments into a single U.S. Retail operating segment, and our Carter’s Wholesale and OshKosh Wholesale operating segments into a single U.S. Wholesale operating segment. This change was made to reflect the sales-channel approach executive management now uses to evaluate business performance and manage operations in the United States. Our International segment was not affected by these changes. Our reportable segments are now U.S. Retail, U.S. Wholesale, and International. Prior periods have been conformed to reflect our current segment structure.
Our U.S. Retail segment consists of revenue primarily from sales of products in the United States through our retail and online stores. Similarly, our U.S. Wholesale segment consists of revenue primarily from sales in the United States of products to our wholesale partners. Finally, our International segment consists of revenue primarily from sales of products outside the United States, primarily through our retail stores in Canada and Mexico, our eCommerce sites in Canada and China, and sales to our international wholesale customers.
Additional financial and geographical information about our segments is contained in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under Note 13, Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements.
Our Brands
Carter's
Under our Carter's brand, we design, source, and market products primarily for sizes newborn to eight. Our focus is on essential, high-volume apparel products for babies and young children. Such products include bodysuits, multi-piece knit sets, pajamas, bibs, blankets, outerwear, shoes, swimwear, playwear, and fashion accessories. We believe that a majority of our products are consumer essentials and are therefore less affected by changes in fashion trends and economic cycles.
Carter’s is the leading brand in the baby category in the United States. In fiscal 2017, our multi-channel business model enabled our Carter’s brand to maintain its leading market share in the United States of approximately 27% for the baby market ages zero to two, which represented approximately four times the market share of the next largest brand.
 2

OshKosh
Under our OshKosh brand, we design, source, and market apparel with an emphasis on high-quality playclothes primarily for children in sizes newborn to 14. Our OshKosh branded products primarily include denim, overalls, t-shirts, fleece, and other playclothes. Our OshKosh brand is generally positioned towards an older segment and at slightly higher average prices relative to the Carter’s brand. We believe our OshKosh brand has significant brand name recognition, which consumers associate with high-quality, durable, and authentic playclothes for young children.
We believe our OshKosh brand represents a significant opportunity for us to increase our market share in the playclothes category as the young children’s playclothes market in the United States is highly fragmented. For fiscal 2017, this market was more than four times the size of the baby and sleepwear markets combined. We strive to grow this business by strengthening our product offerings, improving product value, reducing product complexity, and leveraging our strong customer relationships and global supply chain expertise.
Skip Hop
Under our Skip Hop brand, we design, source, and market products that are sold primarily to families with young children, including diaper bags, kid’s backpacks, lunch bags, travel accessories, home gear, and hardline goods for playtime, mealtime, and bath time. 
Brand and Product Development
We employ cross-functional product teams to focus on the development of our Carter’s, OshKosh, and Skip Hop brands and products. 
Our Carter’s and OshKosh brand teams are skilled and experienced in identifying and developing high-volume, high-value products. Each team includes members from merchandising, art, design, sourcing, product development, and planning. These teams follow a disciplined approach to fabric usage, color selection, and productivity. We also license these brand names to other companies to create a broad collection of lifestyle products, including bedding, hosiery, shoes, room décor, furniture, diaper bags, and toys. The licensing team directs the use of our designs, art, and selling strategies to most licensees.
Similarly, our Skip Hop brand team is skilled and experienced in re-thinking, re-energizing, and re-imagining essential childhood goods. The Skip Hop team includes in-house design and creative studios, which are made up of people who strive to improve the functionality, form, and design of must-have baby and young child products. 
We believe this disciplined approach to product design, which includes consumer research, results in a compelling product offering to consumers, reduces our exposure to short-term trends, and supports efficient operations. 
Brand Positioning
Our vision is to be the leader in baby and young children’s apparel and accessories, and to consistently provide high-quality products at a compelling value to consumers. We employ a disciplined merchandising strategy that identifies and focuses on essential products. 
With our Carter’s and OshKosh brands, we believe that we have strengthened our brand image with the consumer by differentiating our products through fabric and material improvements, new artistic applications, and new packaging and presentation strategies. We also attempt to differentiate our products through in-store fixturing, branding and signage packages, and advertising. We have invested in display fixtures at major wholesale customers that present our products on their floors in a compelling manner intended to enhance brand and product presentation. 
With Skip Hop, we believe we have acquired a global lifestyle brand. Skip Hop’s core philosophy and positioning begins and ends with its brand promise --“Must-Haves * Made Better.” This reflects the brand’s goal of creating innovative, smartly designed, and highly functional essentials for parents, babies, and toddlers. We believe the brand is positioned as a competitively priced source of iconic products that offer greater value through innovation and design. We have recently started to introduce Skip Hop brand products in our retail stores, and increase investment in in-store fixturing, branding, and signage packages, along with digital advertising, to further strengthen the position of the Skip Hop brand.

We similarly strive to provide our wholesale customers with a consistent, high-level of service, including delivering and replenishing products on time to fulfill customer needs. Our retail stores and eCommerce sites focus on the customer experience through store and eCommerce site design, visual aesthetics, clear product presentation, and experienced customer service.
Our Products
Carter's brands
Baby
Carter's brand baby products include bodysuits, pants, dresses, multi-piece knit sets, blankets, layette essentials, bibs, booties, sleep and play, one-piece rompers and jumpers, which are also sold in multiple compelling configurations. 
We sell a complete range of baby products for newborns. These products are primarily made of cotton, including organic cotton as part of our Little Planet collection, which we introduced in late 2017. We attribute our leading market position to our brand strength, unique colors, distinctive prints, commitment to quality, and ability to manage our dedicated floor space for our wholesale customers. Our marketing programs are targeted toward experienced mothers, first-time mothers, and gift-givers. Our little baby basics product line, the largest component of our baby business, provides parents with essential products and accessories, including value-focused multi-piece sets. Our Little Collections product line consists of coordinated baby items designed for first-time mothers and gift-givers. 
Playclothes
Carter's brand playclothes include knit and woven apparel, primarily in cotton, for everyday use in sizes newborn to eight. 
We continue to focus on building our Carter's brand in the playclothes market by developing a base of essential, high-volume products that utilize unique, special, or must-have print designs and innovative artistic applications. Our aggregate fiscal 2017 Carter's brand playclothes market share in the United States was approximately 14% in the $14 billion young children's playclothes market, which represents nearly two times the market share of the next largest brand. 
Sleepwear
Carter's brand sleepwear products include a full range of pajamas in cotton, fleece and poly-jersey, primarily in sizes 12 months to eight. 
Our Carter's brand is the leading brand of sleepwear for babies and young children within the department store, national chain, outlet, specialty store, and off-price sales channels in the United States. In fiscal 2017, in these channels, our Carter's sleepwear brand market share was approximately 30%, which represents approximately four times the market share of the next largest brand. As with our baby product line, we differentiate our sleepwear products by offering high-volume, high-quality, high-value products with distinctive designs and art.
Other Products
Our other product offerings include bedding, outerwear, swimwear, footwear, socks, diaper bags, gift sets, toys, jewelry, cribs, paper goods, and hair accessories. 
Additionally, we license our Carter's, Child of Mine, Just One You, Precious Firsts, and Simple Joys brands to partners to expand our product offerings. We had 11 licensees in the United States as of December 30, 2017. These licensing partners develop and sell products through our multiple sales channels, while leveraging our brand strength, customer relationships, and designs. Licensed products provide our customers and consumers with a range of lifestyle products that complement and expand upon our baby and young children's apparel offerings. Our license agreements require strict adherence to our quality and compliance standards and provide for a multi-step product approval process. We work in conjunction with our licensing partners in the development of their products to ensure that they fit within our brand vision of high-quality products at attractive values to the consumer. In addition, we work closely with our wholesale customers and our licensees to gain dedicated floor space for licensed product categories.

OshKosh brands
Playclothes
Our OshKosh brand is best known for its playclothes products. OshKosh brand playclothes include denim apparel products with multiple wash treatments and coordinating garments, overalls, woven bottoms, knit tops, bodysuits, and playclothes products for everyday use in sizes newborn to 14. Our fiscal 2017 OshKosh brand playclothes market share in the United States was approximately 3% of the $14 billion young children's playclothes market.
Other Products
The remainder of our OshKosh brand product offering includes baby, sleepwear, outerwear, footwear, hosiery, and accessories. 
Additionally, we partner with a number of domestic licensees to extend the reach of our OshKosh brand. As of December 30, 2017, we had five licensees selling apparel and accessories. Our largest OshKosh licensing agreement is with Target Corporation (“Target”). All Genuine Kids from OshKosh products sold by Target are sold pursuant to this licensing agreement. Our licensed products provide our customers and consumers with a range of OshKosh products including outerwear, underwear, swimwear, socks, shoes, and accessories. 
Skip Hop brand
Our Skip Hop brand is best known for its diaper bags, which we believe combine innovative functionality with attractive design. The Skip Hop brand offering also includes products for playtime, travel, mealtime, kid’s bags, bathtime, and homegear.
Our Sales Channels
We sell our Carter’s, OshKosh, and Skip Hop branded products through multiple channels - retail stores, online, and wholesale - both in the United States and globally.
U.S. Retail
Our U.S. retail sales channel includes sales of our products through our U.S. retail stores and eCommerce sites.
Our U.S. retail stores are generally located in high-traffic strip shopping centers in or near major cities or outlet centers that are generally located within 20 to 30 minutes of densely-populated areas. We believe our brand strength and our assortment of products, often localized for climate differences, have made our retail stores a destination for consumers who shop for young children's apparel and accessories.
We operate retail stores in three different formats: Carter’s stand-alone stores, OshKosh stand-alone stores, and stores in our dual-branded format. Our dual-branded format includes “side-by-side” locations and “co-branded” locations. The dual-branded format allows customers to shop for both the Carter’s and OshKosh brands in a single location. “Side-by-side” locations, which are located only in the United States, consist of adjacent retail stores for our Carter’s and OshKosh brands that are connected and counted as a single dual-branded format location. “Co-branded” locations consist of a single retail store that offers products from our Carter’s and Oshkosh brands and are also counted as a single dual-branded format location. We also sell our Skip Hop products at certain of our retail store locations.
As of December 30, 2017, we operated 466 Carter's stand-alone retail stores in the United States. These stores carry a complete assortment of baby and young children's apparel, accessories, and gift items. Our stores average approximately 4,400 square feet per location and are distinguished by an easy, consumer-friendly shopping environment. 
As of December 30, 2017, we operated 131 OshKosh stand-alone retail stores in the United States. These stores carry a wide assortment of young children's apparel, accessories, and gift items, and average approximately 4,600 square feet per location.
As of December 30, 2017, we operated 233 dual-branded format retail stores in the United States which consisted of 159 “side-by-side” locations and 74 “co-branded” locations. Our “co-branded” stores in the United States average approximately 5,000 square feet per location, are slightly larger than our single-brand retail stores in the United States, and offer a similar product assortment.

We assess potential new retail store locations based on demographic factors, retail adjacencies, and population density, as part of a rigorous real estate selection process.
We also sell our products through our online U.S. eCommerce sites at www.carters.com, www.oshkoshbgosh.com, www.oshkosh.com, and www.skiphop.com. Each online store offers a full assortment of products from each of our brands.
In fiscal 2017, our U.S. Retail net sales were approximately $1.78 billion, representing 52.2% of our consolidated net sales.
U.S. Wholesale
Our U.S. wholesale channel includes sales of our products to our U.S. wholesale accounts.
Our Carter’s brand wholesale customers in the United States include major retailers, such as, in alphabetical order, Costco, JCPenney, Kohl’s, Macy’s, and Toys "R" Us. Additionally, we sell our Child of Mine brand at Walmart, our Just One You brand at Target, and our Simple Joys brand on Amazon. 
Our OshKosh brand wholesale customers in the United States include major retailers, such as, in alphabetical order, Costco, JCPenney, Kohl’s, and Toys "R" Us. We also have a licensing agreement with Target, through which Target sells products under our Genuine Kids from OshKosh brand.

In fiscal 2017, our U.S. Wholesale net sales were approximately $1.21 billion, representing 35.6% of our consolidated net sales. 
International
Our International segment includes sales through company - and franchisee-operated retail stores, online eCommerce sites, and international wholesale accounts, as well as royalty income from international licensees of the Carter’s and OshKosh brands. In August 2017, we acquired our Mexican licensee and its related business. 
As of December 30, 2017, we operated 179 co-branded Carter’s and OshKosh retail stores in Canada and our online store at www.cartersoshkosh.ca. We also operated 41 retail stores in Mexico. 
In addition, we operate an eCommerce site in China, and we also reach consumers in approximately 60 countries through wholesale and licensing relationships and in over 100 countries through eCommerce sites.
In fiscal 2017, net sales in our International segment were approximately $415.5 million, representing 12.2% of our consolidated net sales.
Our Customer and Marketing Strategy
For all of our brands, our marketing is predominately focused on driving brand preference and engagement with millennial customers. As such, we continue to strengthen and evolve our digital programs to keep our brands in front of the consumer. Our multi-channel approach -- which includes retail stores, online stores, and a mobile application -- allows the customer to experience the brand as a seamless shopping experience in the channel of their choice. Our investments in marketing, our loyalty program, and new technologies are focused on acquiring new customers, developing stronger connections with our existing customers, and extending their relationship with our brands. Our goal is to have the most top-of-mind, preferred brands in the young children’s market and to connect with a diverse, digitally-savvy customer.
During fiscal 2015, we launched our Rewarding Moments loyalty and rewards program in the United States to drive customer traffic, sales, and brand loyalty. This program is integrated across our retail stores and online businesses. During fiscal 2017, our retail sales were predominantly made to customers who are members of Rewarding Moments. In addition, during fiscal 2017, we launched our mobile application in the United States, which allows our customers to shop and purchase products from all of our brands directly from their mobile device.

Our Global Sourcing Network
We source our garments and other products from a global network of suppliers, primarily from Asia and Central America. Prior to placing production, and on a recurring basis, we conduct assessments of political, social, economic, trade, labor and intellectual property protection conditions in the countries in which we source our products.
We expect all of our suppliers shipping to the United States to adhere to the requirements of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”) program, including standards relating to facility security, procedural security, personnel security, cargo security, and the overall protection of the supply chain. In the event a supplier does not comply with our C-TPAT requirements, or if we have determined that the supplier will be unable to correct a deficiency, we may move that supplier’s product through alternative supply chain channels or we may terminate our business relationship with the supplier.
We believe that our sourcing arrangements are sufficient to meet our current operating requirements and provide capacity for growth. 
Our Global Distribution Network 
Domestically, we operate two distribution centers in Georgia: our approximately 1.1 million square-foot multi-channel facility in Braselton and a 505,000 square-foot facility in Stockbridge. We also outsource distribution activities to third-party logistics providers in California. Our distribution center activities include receiving finished goods from our vendors, inspecting those products, preparing them for retail and wholesale presentation, and shipping them to our customers and to our retail stores.
Internationally, we operate directly or outsource our distribution activities to third-party logistics providers in Canada, China, United Kingdom, and Mexico to support our international wholesale customers, eCommerce operations, and Canadian and Mexican retail store network. 
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our products are subject to regulation of and regulatory standards with respect to quality and safety set by various governmental authorities around the world, including in the United States, Canada, China, Mexico, and the European Union. Our operations also are subject to various international trade agreements and regulations. 
We are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that govern our activities, operations, and products that may have adverse environmental and health and safety effects, including laws and regulations relating to generating emissions, water discharge, waste, product and packaging content, and workplace safety. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in substantial monetary penalties and criminal sanctions. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
We have adopted a factory on-boarding program that allows us to assess each factory’s compliance with our social responsibility standards before we place orders for product with that factory, and that allows us to assess, integrate, and enhance factories that were used by companies that we acquire. Additionally, we regularly assess the manufacturing facilities we use through periodic on-site facility inspections, including the use of independent monitors to supplement our internal staff. We use audit data and performance results to suggest improvements when necessary, and also integrate this information into our sourcing decisions. Our vendor code of conduct covers employment practices, such as wages and benefits, working hours, health and safety, working age, and discriminatory practices, as well as environmental, ethical, and other legal matters. 
Competition
The baby and young children’s apparel and accessories market is highly competitive. Competition is generally based upon product quality, brand name recognition, price, selection, service, and convenience. Both branded and private label manufacturers aggressively compete in the baby and young children’s apparel market. Our primary competitors in the wholesale channel include private label product offerings, and, in alphabetical order, Disney, Garanimals and Gerber. Our primary competitors in the retail channel include, in alphabetical order, Disney, Gap, Old Navy, and The Children’s Place. Most retailers, including our wholesale customers, have significant private label product offerings that compete with our products. Because of the highly-fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with many small manufacturers and retailers. We 
 7

believe that the strength of our brand names, combined with our breadth of product offerings, distribution footprint, and operational expertise, position us well against these competitors. 
Seasonality
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability due to the timing of certain holidays and key retail shopping periods, which generally have resulted in lower sales and gross profit in the first half of our fiscal year versus the second half of the year. Accordingly, our results of operations during the first half of the year may not be indicative of the results we expect for the full fiscal year.
