ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Business Overview
 
Wikisoft Corp. has a vision to become one of the largest big data providers of information for businesses. Our portal, which initially launched in January 2018, is called wikiprofile.com and seeks to provide information on companies, business people and investors.
 
        Our website portal is currently operational and was relaunched in its beta form on June 1, 2021. At this time, we are focused on applying product improvements from beta-user feedback, establishing a maintenance and support cadence and developing new features and functionalities. Product design and strategy decisions rest with our European team and are actioned by our software developers based in India.
 
In Q1 2022 we commenced development on a new platform named Wikifunding, a website aimed to accelerate matching startups with investors. With the February 28, 2022 acquisition of a majority interest in Etheralabs LLC, a New York City based venture lab and ecosystem that invests in, builds, and deploys disruptive technologies across the Blockchain space, Wikisoft´s vision is to combine the company’s massive amount of data on startups, funds and investors with Etheralabs’ disruptive Blockchain technology to accelerate finance partnerships between startups and investors.
 
Since June 1, 2021, testing of the beta site and a stabilization period was commenced. New features and improvements have been implemented, which include but are not limited to: Company reviews, improved sign-up process with an automatic look-up to make it easy to join the platform free of charge and advanced filtering options and search algorithms to give more relevant results. Since relaunch of site, we have had continuous growth of business profiles and the total number of profiles exceeds 175 million. The number include claimed and unclaimed company and people profiles. We expect to test, refine and roll out commercial products including Lead generation and Newswire in the FY 2022.
 
We expect that IT development will continue to utilize existing development capability. Additional developers will be hired if required for enhancements in crawling and frontend development of business logic and new commercial products. We also expect to commence marketing activities seeking to generate additional users and sign ups to our website platform. The main drivers will be email, search engine marketing and Search Engine Optimization.
 
We plan to generate revenues primarily from subscription on premium profiles on our websites. We also further plan to generate revenues by charging for access to certain information and premium features on our platform such as press wires and lead generation on prospects whether it is investors, suppliers, employees or future partners.
 
Our offices are located at 315 Montgomery Street, San Francisco, CA 94104, and our telephone number is 800-706-0806. Our website address is www.wikiprofile.com and wikisoft.com and our email address is investor@wikisoft.com. We also currently have websites at the following website addresses: Wikisoft.com, wikicareer.com, wikiinvestor.org, wikihired.com, wikiinvestment.com platform wikifunding.com, which redirect the user to our investor site wikisoft.com or our flagship website wikiprofile.com or upcoming platform wikifunding.com. Information contained on, or accessible through, all of the foregoing websites is not a part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
Value Proposition
 
In today’s fast-moving business world of increasing globalization, Wikisoft leverages big data and associated insights from business datasets to improve performance.
 In line with this new phase of globalization, Wikisoft believes that there is a growing demand for access to credible and reliable business data. Data is essential to creating the complete view of customers, prospects, investors, suppliers, and partners necessary to power the right decisions.

Our Vision and Strategy
 
Our vision is to create opportunity globally by collecting precise data, curating it, verifying it and putting it the hands of professionals and businesses as consumable business intelligence. We believe in the power of Wikisoft to collect massive amounts of data and deliver it to businesses curated, credible and reliable.
 
We have not yet generated any revenue from our platform. However, we believe that Wikisoft’s competitive strengths within this industry include but are not limited to:
 

● | Large global business database that can be used for Marketing & Sales;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Highly scalable setup geared towards the future growth journey;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Limited operational cost geared for growth;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Data crawled, verified & updated daily; and
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Disruptive business model with low entrance barrier.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

  
We believe that trusted business information is more relevant than ever to provide a complete view of customers, prospects, investors, suppliers, and partners necessary to power the right decisions.
 
Our strategy is focused on key value propositions for both non-paying users and paying users. We plan to generate revenues primarily from subscription on premium profiles, news wires and providing leads on prospects whether it is on future investors, suppliers, employees or partners on our website platforms. We also further plan to generate revenues by charging users of our website platform for access to certain information and features on our platform, as described further below.

Our Website Portals and How we Plan to Generate Revenue
 
On our platforms users are able to freely search the portals and all content is collected and updated in real-time. Our platforms are developed on multiple databases that provide the foundation for our Wikiprofile and upcoming Wikifunding platforms. The scalable microservice architecture aims to remove the load pressure from a server-oriented focus and utilizes the resources on various browsers to deliver a user experience with modern well performing page speed due to architecture. The architecture is designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. Using proprietary crawler technology, the databases automatically collect information on newly found entities, seeking to have an up to date database.
 
On the platform users are able to freely search the portal and most of our products at no cost. The plan is to generate consumer usage and with the belief that our upcoming planned premium business model and paid products drives the most value for business professionals and businesses.
 
We expect that the completed platforms will create value for our customers through three distinct planned product lines:
 
●        Wiki Businesss Profiles
 ●        Wiki Lead Generation
 ●        Wiki Press Wire

Wiki Business Profiles
 
The Wiki Business Profiles include a free basic profile and allow business professionals and companies to highlight their online brand to create awareness and provide useful business information. We believe that the profile will also help companies and business professionals to build trust that will attract new customers better employees and for business professionals to get job proposals. We plan to have additional features like premium ranking, contact information, data insights to make research and to ensure the right decision making when choosing to invest in a company or choosing a new employer or supplier. We have not yet decided the fees we will charge for such additional features.
Wiki Lead Generation
 
Wiki Lead Generation is planned to include packages of leads to get essential business information to create the complete view of customers, prospects, investors, suppliers, and partners necessary to power the right decisions. The information in the lead packages will include the ability to communicate directly and get information such as name, location, industry, key employees, phone number, contact email, among others. The data may be imported into Excel or a CRM platform.
Wiki Press Wire.
 
Wiki Press Wire, an AmpliFi press release distribution service, available through the acquisition of Etheralabs is expected to be accessible to the more than 90 million businesses now held in the Wikisoft database. The press wire will be published and distributed into the most important news databases and news wires to reach journalists, investors and media influencers. Furthermore the news wire is expected to attain long-term visibility in search engines and include SEO benefits at a Cost-effective and affordable budget to small and medium sized companies. Personnel
 
Our Chairman, Paul Quintal, is responsible for leading the Company’s Board, of which he is currently the sole member, and focusing on strategic matters, overseeing the Company’s business and setting high governance standards. Our Chief Executive Officer, Carsten Kjems Falk, is overall accountable for strategy and general daily management of operations. Our IT manager, Dinesh Shanmugam, is responsible for IT development and architecture in our Company. He is assisted by in-house and independent contractors for IT development.
Plan of Operations
 
For the 2022 fiscal year, we expect to require a minimum of $500,000 in operating funds. The source of such funds is anticipated to be from capital raised from third parties. The founder Rasmus Refer, who owns 3.5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock as of the date of this report, pursuant to a Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) between him and the Company, dated December 30, 2020, has agreed to make unsecured loans and extensions of credit available to the Company of up to $1,000,000, as requested by the Company under the Credit Agreement, to implement the Company’s plan of operations if we are unable to raise sufficient funds from other sources.
 
If we are able to raise funds from third parties exceeding $500,000, we plan to accelerate our plan of operations as much as possible consistent with the amount of funds raised and the Company’s strategy. We would need approximately $3-5,000,000 representing the optimal level of funds to maximize our platform development efforts and provide the best opportunity to accelerate growth and roll out globally our business plan.

First Half of 2022
 
In the first half of 2022, we plan to further develop Wikiprofile.com and launch organization hierarchy to company profiles so users can see employees working in the company to complement our planned lead generation product. Furthermore, we anticipate implementing payment gateway to test the first commercial products for lead generation and presswire service. We expect to launch wikifunding.com and make backend integrations with Etheralabs´ services to utilize synergies from the acquisition. We anticipate hiring additional developers to accelerate development. We expect that the total cost for the foregoing activities will be an estimated amount of $200,000.
Second Half of 2022
 
In the second half of 2022 we plan to further develop Wikiprofile.com and Wikifunding. The main focus will be backend integrations with Etheralabs´ services to utilize synergies, data collection and refining our commercial products for lead generation and press wire service. We anticipate hiring a customer service manager to ensure optimization of products and to ensure customer satisfaction and get customer feedback to optimize commercial packages. We expect that the total cost for the foregoing activities will be an estimated amount of $300,000.
 
If we are able to raise funds from third parties exceeding $500,000, we plan to accelerate our plan of operations as much as possible consistent with the amount of funds raised and the Company’s strategy.
 Achievement of the foregoing plan of operations will depend highly on our funds and the availability of those funds and accordingly there can be no assurance that we can implement the foregoing as planned or at all.

Acquisition of Etheralabs LLC
 
On February 28, 2022 the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 51% of Etheralabs LLC a New York City based venture lab and ecosystem that invests in, builds, and deploys disruptive technologies across the Blockchain space and The transaction includes a global access to Etheralabs´ full stack of technologies across the Blockchain and global funding landscape. Etheralabs ecosystem allows development and finance partnerships throughout the blockchain world and beyond, and connects the blockchain community, investors and venture capital to relevant data intelligence and direct investment opportunities. Wikisoft intends to ensure that Etheralabs future product and technology roadmap supports wikiprofile.com and the upcoming Wikifunding platform aiming to accelerate matching investors to startups.
 
Intellectual Property
          In Q1 2022 we commenced development on a new platform named Wikifunding, a website aimed to accelerate matching startups with investors. With the February 28, 2022 acquisition of a majority interest in Etheralabs LLC, a New York City based venture lab and ecosystem that invests in, builds, and deploys disruptive technologies across the Blockchain space, Wikisoft´s vision is to combine the company’s massive amount of data on startups, funds and investors with Etheralabs’ disruptive Blockchain technology to accelerate finance partnerships between startups and investors.
 
We expect that IT development will continue to utilize existing development capability.

We also expect to commence marketing activities seeking to generate additional users and sign ups to our website platform. The main drivers will be email, search engine marketing and Search Engine Optimization.
 
While the Company uses reasonable efforts to protect its trade and business secrets, the Company cannot assure that its employees, consultants, contractors or advisors will not, unintentionally or willfully, disclose the Company's trade secrets to competitors or other third parties. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, the Company's competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. If the Company is unable to defend the Company's trade secrets from others use, or if the Company's competitors develop equivalent knowledge, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. Any infringement of the Company's proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to adequately protect the Company's proprietary rights could result in the Company's competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenue. Existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the Company's proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Therefore, the Company may not be able to protect the Company's proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party use. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using the Company's trade secrets could be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome of such a claim is unpredictable. Litigation may be necessary in the future to protect the Company's trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could materially adversely affect the Company's future operating results.
 
Competition
 
The big data analysis, recruiting and data generation sector is highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the internet industry. We face intense competition from companies with much larger capital resources than us, and, as a result, we could struggle to attract users and gain market share. Many of our existing or future competitors have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and, as a result, may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole. We will strive to advance our technology in each of these sectors ahead of our competitors to gain market share. We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to compensate employees competitively. We face significant competition in several aspects of our business, and such competition might increase, particularly in the market for online professional networks and engagement of professionals.

-


The space for online professional networks is rapidly evolving. Other companies such as LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter might be developing or could develop solutions that compete with ours. Further, some of these companies are partnering with third parties that could compete with ours. Additionally, we face competition from a number of companies outside the United States that provide online professional networking solutions. We also compete against smaller companies that focus on groups of professionals within a specific industry or vertical. Our competitors may announce new products, services or enhancements that better address changing industry standards or the needs of users, such as mobile access or different market focus. Any such increased competition could cause pricing pressure, loss of business or decreased user activity, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Internet search engines could also change their methodologies in ways that adversely affect our ability to optimize our page rankings within their search results.
 
With respect to our planned recruitment service through our website platform, we will compete with online recruiting companies, talent management companies and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services, job boards, traditional recruiting firms and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Additionally, other companies, including newcomers to the recruiting or learning and development industries, may partner with Internet companies to provide services that compete with our solutions, either on their own or as third-party applications. Therefore, we might not be able to compete successfully.
 
We believe that we have competitive strengths that position us favorably in our lines of business. However, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. Larger and more established companies may focus on professional networking and could directly compete with us. Smaller companies could also launch new products and services that we do not offer and that could gain market acceptance quickly.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business online, many of which are evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the United States and abroad, laws and regulations relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, or the content provided by users. Further some countries impose regulations regarding or require licenses to conduct various aspects of our business, including employee recruiting, and news related services. Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services for the activities of their users or other third parties could harm our business. In addition, rising concern about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct, such as the unauthorized dissemination of national security information, money laundering or supporting terrorist activities, may in the future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our website platform, restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon material aspects of our platform.
 
In the area of information security and data protection, most states have enacted laws and regulations requiring notification to users when there is a security breach of personal data, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may increase in the future as a result of amendments or changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities.
 
We are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and protection of data. Our privacy policies describe our practices concerning the use, storage, transmission and disclosure of personal information, including visitor and user data. Any failure by us to comply with these terms or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations and their application to online services are unclear,

evolving and in a state of flux. For example, in October 2015, the highest court in the European Union invalidated reliance on the US-EU Safe Harbor regime as one of the legally recognized mechanisms under which the personal data of European citizens could be transferred to the United States. We believe that our processing of European citizens’ personal data in the United States is authorized under other legally recognized mechanisms, but the validity of these other legal mechanisms is not certain and may change in light of changes in the political, legislative and legal environment in Europe. There is a risk that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices, or that new laws or regulations will be enacted. In addition, because our website platform is accessible worldwide, certain foreign governments may claim that we are required to comply with their laws and regulations, including with respect to the storage, use and disclosure of user information, even in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees, or infrastructure. Complying with these varying domestic and international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data could result in a loss of user confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business. 
 
History and Organization
 
Wikisoft Corp. was incorporated in the state of Nevada in under the name Sensor Technologies, Inc. on May 4, 1998. In March 2006 the Company changed its name to Bixby Energy Systems Inc. The Company changed its name to Power Play Development Corporation in September 2006. In April 2007 the Company changed its name to National League of Poker, Inc. In October 2011 the Company changed its name back to Power Play Development Corporation. In March 2018 the Company changed its name to Bluestar Technologies, Inc. In March 2018, the Company then changed its name to Wikisoft Corp.
 
In May 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors terminated the services of all prior officers and directors and the board appointed Robert Stevens as the Board Appointed Receiver for the Company. This was a private receivership where the receiver was appointed by the board to act on behalf of the Company and no court filings were ever made in connection with the receivership. On April 16, 2019 in connection with the Merger described below, Robert Stevens resigned from all of his positions with the Company and the board appointed receivership was concluded. At that time Rasmus Refer was appointed as the Company’s CEO and Director, and he resigned from such positions in August and November 2020, respectively. Rasmus Refer was previously the CEO of the Company until August 31, 2020 and Director of the Company until November 30, 2020, and our current CEO and sole director were appointed thereafter as described in detail below.
 
On April 16, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with WikiSoft Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation which was then the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”) and WikiSoft Corp., a privately held Delaware corporation (“WikiSoft DE”). In connection with the closing of this merger transaction, Merger Sub merged with and into WikiSoft DE (the “Merger”) on April 30, 2019. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company acquired WikiSoft DE which then became its wholly owned subsidiary.
 
On March 19, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Short Form Merger Agreement”) with WikiSoft DE, pursuant to which it was agreed that the Company would merge with and into WikiSoft DE, with the Company surviving. Thereafter, on March 25, 2020, WikiSoft DE merged with and into the Company, with the Company (i.e. Wikisoft Corp. - the NV corporation) surviving pursuant to a Certificate of Ownership and Merger filed in with Delaware Secretary of State, whereby the then wholly owned subsidiary (WikiSoft DE) merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving. On March 25, 2020, the Company filed Articles of Conversion in Nevada, whereby the then subsidiary (WikiSoft DE) merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving.

--


Prior to the Merger, the Company did not have any business operations, and at the closing of the Merger, the Company’s business became its current business as described in detail above and throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Employees
 
We have 3 full-time employees and 6 project by project independent contractors. We believe that we have good relations with our employees and contractors.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may become party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party, as plaintiff or defendant, to any legal proceedings that we believe to be material or which, individually or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation if determined adversely to us.
Smaller Reporting Company
 
The Company is a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. There are certain exemptions available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years. As long as we maintain our status as a “smaller reporting company”, these exemptions will continue to be available to us.
Emerging Growth Company
 
As a public company with less than $1,070,000,000 in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies and can avail itself to various exemptions such as an exemption from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
In particular, as an emerging growth company we:
 

● | are not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | are not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as “compensation discussion and analysis”);
● | are not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly referred to as the “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency” and “say-on-golden-parachute” votes); 
● | are exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure; 
● | may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”); and 
● | are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act. 


12
--


We intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under §107 of the JOBS Act.
 
Certain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or Chief Executive Officer pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.
 
Under the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” if we have more than $1,070,000,000 in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our Common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We would cease to be an emerging growth company on the last day of the fiscal year following the date of the fifth anniversary of our first sale of common equity securities under an effective registration statement or a fiscal year in which we have $1 billion in gross revenues. Further, under current SEC rules we will continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” for so long as we have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $250 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.
