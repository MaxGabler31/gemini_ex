Item 1.    BUSINESS
Who We Are
We are Liberty Global plc (Liberty Global), the world's largest international television and broadband company. We are focused on building a strong convergence of fixed and mobile communication opportunities and we are constantly striving to enhance and simplify our customers’ lives through quality services and products that give them the freedom to connect, converse, work and be entertained anytime, anywhere they choose.
Liberty Global has consolidated operations in 12 European countries serving 22.0 million customers at December 31, 2017. Our primary business operations are listed below, all of which we consolidate, with the exception of the VodafoneZiggo JV (defined below).

Brand | Entity | Location | Ownership
 | Virgin Media | United Kingdom & Ireland | 100.0% 
 | Unitymedia | Germany | 100.0% 
 | Telenet | Belgium & Luxembourg | 57.4% 
 | UPC Holding | Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia | 100.0% 
 | VodafoneZiggo | Netherlands | 50.0% 

General Development of Business
As a result of a series of mergers that were completed on June 7, 2013, Liberty Global became the publicly-held parent company of the successors by merger of Liberty Global, Inc. (the predecessor to Liberty Global) and Virgin Media Inc. (Virgin Media). In the following text, the terms “we”, “our”, “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) or collectively to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated, convenience translations into United States (U.S.) dollars are calculated as of December 31, 2017, and operational data, including subscriber statistics and ownership percentages, are as of December 31, 2017.
On December 29, 2017, we effected the split-off of our LiLAC Group (the Split-off Transaction) by distributing 100% of the common shares of Liberty Latin America Ltd. (Liberty Latin America) to holders of our then LiLAC ordinary shares (the LiLAC Shares). The “LiLAC Group” consisted of our businesses, assets and liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Cable & Wireless Communications Limited (C&W), VTR.com SpA, a 60% interest in Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC (Liberty Puerto Rico) and related cash and cash equivalents and indebtedness. Just prior to the completion of the Split-off Transaction, all of the businesses, assets and liabilities of the LiLAC Group were transferred to Liberty Latin America, which was then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Global. Following such distribution, the LiLAC Shares were redesignated as deferred shares (with virtually no economic rights) and Liberty Latin America became a separate publicly traded company. As a result, we no longer own Liberty Latin America and the former operations of the LiLAC Group. As a result of the Split-off Transaction, the entities attributed to the LiLAC Group are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all applicable periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, the below discussion of our business focuses on our continuing operations.
I-1

Expansion and Acquisitions
We have expanded our broadband footprint through new build projects and strategically selected acquisitions. Our new build projects consist of network extension programs pursuant to which we connect additional homes and businesses to our broadband communications network (Network Extensions). Our investment in Network Extensions is critical not only for our business to grow, but also for the countries and communities in which we operate. The Network Extensions, together with upgrades to our existing networks and next generation customer premises equipment, provide our customers the means to enter the gigaworld society. During 2015 and 2016, we initiated Network Extensions in the United Kingdom (U.K.), Germany, Ireland, Central and Eastern Europe and certain other markets. During 2017, through our Network Extensions, our continuing operations connected approximately 1,177,000 additional residential and commercial premises (excluding upgrades) to our two-way networks, including approximately 536,000 residential and commercial premises connected by Virgin Media in the U.K. and Ireland through Project Lightning. We expect to continue the Network Extensions in 2018. Depending on a variety of factors, however, including the financial and operations results of our new build programs, any Network Extensions may be continued, modified or cancelled at our discretion. 
Over the past five years, we have also completed several strategic acquisitions. We made these acquisitions in order to deliver the scale that allows us to innovate effectively and invest in great content and the best products. This enables us to deliver quality services to our customers. Our significant acquisitions include:

• | On June 19, 2017, Telenet Group Holding N.V. (Telenet) acquired Coitel Brabant sprl, operating under the brand name SFR BeLux (SFR BeLux), which provided broadband operations in Belgium (Brussels and Wallonia) and Luxembourg.


• | On May 16, 2016, we acquired C&W, a provider of telecommunication services, including mobile and high-speed broadband, focused in Latin America and the Caribbean (the C&W Acquisition). In connection with the Split-off Transaction, we transferred C&W to Liberty Latin America.


• | On February 11, 2016, Telenet acquired BASE Company N.V. (BASE), the third-largest mobile network operator in Belgium. 


• | On June 3, 2015, we acquired, together with investment funds affiliated with Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P., Choice Cable TV, a cable and broadband services provider in Puerto Rico, which was integrated into the operations of Liberty Puerto Rico. In connection with the Split-off Transaction, we transferred Liberty Puerto Rico to Liberty Latin America.


• | In November 2014, we gained control of Ziggo Holding B.V. (Ziggo), a provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services in the Netherlands, and integrated Ziggo into our Netherlands broadband operations. This business was contributed to form the VodafoneZiggo JV (as defined below), a 50:50 joint venture, on December 31, 2016.

For additional information on our more recent acquisitions see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we have completed various other smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business.
Pending Acquisitions
In October 2016, through a subsidiary of UPC Holding B.V. (UPC Holding), we entered into an agreement to acquire the cable business of Multimedia Polska S.A. (Multimedia), a broadband communications provider in Poland. We are currently uncertain as to the timing of closing this transaction.
For additional information on the above proposed acquisition, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Dispositions
In addition to the Split-off Transaction, we completed the following dispositions during the past five years: 

• | On December 31, 2016, our company and Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) contributed our respective operations in the Netherlands to VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V., a 50:50 joint venture (referred to herein as the “VodafoneZiggo JV”). We treat the VodafoneZiggo JV as an equity investment.


• | On January 31, 2014, we sold substantially all of our programming interest held through Chellomedia B.V.

I-2

For additional information on our more recent dispositions, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have also completed various other smaller dispositions in the normal course of business and as required by regulatory authorities in connection with approving the BASE and Ziggo acquisitions. 
Pending Dispositions
Recently we entered into an agreement to sell our Austrian operations (UPC Austria). Closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, which are not expected until the second half of 2018. 
For additional information on the above proposed disposition, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Equity Transactions 
Pursuant to our share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors, we have repurchased a significant amount of our shares since our inception in 2005. During 2017, our share repurchases were: 

Title of shares | | Number of shares | Average price paid per share* | | Aggregate purchase price*
 | | | | | in millions 
Liberty Global Class A | 34,881,510 | | $ | 33.73 | | $ | 1,176.9
Liberty Global Class C | 52,523,651 | | $ | 32.71 | | $ | 1,717.8

Narrative Description of Business
We are a leading international telecommunications company with a commitment to providing our customers the “best in class” communications and entertainment services. These services are delivered to our residential and business customers over our networks and include video, broadband internet, telephony and mobile services. We also deliver mobile services over our own networks and through third-party networks as MVNOs. We design these services to enable our customers to access the digital world on their own terms and at their own pace. In most of our footprint, the core of our offer is “triple-play”, which we use to describe bundled services of digital video, internet and telephony in one subscription. We are enhancing this offer by expanding our services to include mobile services for a “quad-play” or fixed-mobile convergence service in most of our markets. Available service offerings depend on the bandwidth capacity of a particular system and whether it has been upgraded for two-way communications. In certain markets, we also offer video services through direct-to-home satellite (DTH) and fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) networks. 
Following the completion of the Split-off Transaction, our consolidated operations are in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria and Central and Eastern Europe. In terms of video subscribers, we operate the largest cable network in each of Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland and the U.K. and the second largest cable network in each of Germany and Romania. We also have investments in the VodafoneZiggo JV, which operates the largest cable network in the Netherlands, and in various content businesses.
In connecting our customers through our telecommunication services, we recognize that we are a global corporate citizen—that we play a role in addressing the environmental impacts generated through our business. By seeking to address these issues, we strengthen our company and positively influence the communities in which we operate. This includes enhancing the energy efficiency of all our operations, with a focus on energy use, carbon emissions and management of electronic waste. We also recognize that coding skills are essential to our industry and other technology-based jobs of the future. As a result, we have partnered with the CoderDojo Foundation, a global community of free coding clubs for children age 7-17. Our support for CoderDojo is enabling the next generation of creators, improving their long-term career prospects. We are also working with European Schoolnet to raise awareness of teachers on educational resources available for them to help address online issues teenagers are facing. Corporate responsibility is a key part of our business.

__________________

(1) | Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially extending the distribution plant, except for DTH homes. Certain of our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. We do not count homes passed for DTH. Due to the fact that we do not own the partner networks (defined below) used in Switzerland (see note 11 below), we do not report homes passed for Switzerland’s partner networks.


(2) | Two-way Homes Passed are Homes Passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way services, including video, internet and telephony services.


(3) | Cable Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or telephony services that we count as Revenue Generating Units (RGUs), without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. To the extent that RGU counts include equivalent billing unit (EBU) adjustments, we reflect corresponding adjustments to our Cable Customer Relationship counts. For further information regarding our EBU calculation, see Additional General Notes to Tables below. Cable Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two Cable Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Cable Customer Relationships.


(4) | RGU is separately a Basic Video Subscriber, Enhanced Video Subscriber, DTH Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber (each as defined and described below). A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer in our U.K. market subscribed to our enhanced video service, fixed-line telephony service and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Basic Video, Enhanced Video, DTH, Internet and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers or free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our December 31, 2017 RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.


(5) | Basic Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network either via an analog video signal or via a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Encryption-enabling technology includes conditional access security cards or “smart cards”, or other integrated or virtual technologies that we use to provide our enhanced service offerings. With the exception of RGUs that we count on an EBU basis, we count RGUs on a unique premises basis. In other words, a subscriber with multiple outlets in one premises is counted as one RGU and a subscriber with two homes and a subscription to our video service at each home is counted as two RGUs. In Europe, we have approximately 192,700 “lifeline” customers that are counted on a per connection basis, representing the least expensive regulated tier of video cable service, with only a few channels.


(6) | Enhanced Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network or through a partner network via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Enhanced Video Subscribers that are not counted on an EBU basis are counted on a unique premises basis. For example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises is generally counted as just one subscriber. An Enhanced Video Subscriber is not counted as a Basic Video Subscriber. As we migrate customers from basic to enhanced video services, we report a decrease in our Basic Video Subscribers equal to the increase in our Enhanced Video Subscribers. Subscribers to enhanced video services provided by our operations in Switzerland over partner networks receive basic video services from the partner networks as opposed to our operations.


(7) | DTH Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming broadcast directly via a geosynchronous satellite.


(8) | Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Our Internet Subscribers exclude 39,100 digital subscriber line (DSL) subscribers within Austria that are not serviced over our networks. Our Internet Subscribers do not include customers that receive services from dial-up connections. In Switzerland, we offer a 2 Mbps internet service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Internet Subscribers in Switzerland include 83,900 subscribers who have requested and received this service.


(9) | Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. Our Telephony Subscribers exclude 30,000 subscribers within Austria that are not serviced over our networks. In Switzerland, we offer a basic phone service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony Subscribers in Switzerland include 131,000 subscribers who have requested and received this service.


(10) | Our Mobile Subscriber count represents the number of active subscriber identification module (SIM) cards in service rather than services provided. For example, if a Mobile Subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one Mobile

I-8

Subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop (via a dongle) would be counted as two Mobile Subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our Mobile Subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country. In a number of countries, our Mobile Subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. As of December 31, 2017, our Mobile Subscriber count included 515,200 and 514, 300 prepaid Mobile Subscribers in Belgium and the U.K., respectively. 

(11) | Pursuant to service agreements, Switzerland offers enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony services over networks owned by third-party cable operators (partner networks). A partner network RGU is only recognized if there is a direct billing relationship with the customer. At December 31, 2017, Switzerland’s partner networks account for 138,100 Cable Customer Relationships, 315,800 RGUs, 113,700 Enhanced Video Subscribers, 116,000 Internet Subscribers and 86,100 Telephony Subscribers.

Additional General Notes to Table:
Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other business services. Certain of our business service revenue is derived from small or home office (SOHO) subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. To the extent our existing customers upgrade from a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers will increase but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. With the exception of our business SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of business services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.
Certain of our residential and commercial RGUs are counted on an EBU basis, including residential multiple dwelling units and commercial establishments (with the exception of Germany and Belgium, where we do not count any RGUs on an EBU basis). Our EBUs are generally calculated by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service. As such, we may experience variances in our EBU counts solely as a result of changes in rates. In Germany, homes passed reflect the footprint and two-way homes passed reflect the technological capability of our network up to the street cabinet, with drops from the street cabinet to the building generally added, and in-home wiring generally upgraded, on an as needed or success-based basis. In Belgium, Telenet leases a portion of its network under a long-term capital lease arrangement. These tables include operating statistics for Telenet’s owned and leased networks. 
While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (1) the nature and pricing of products and services, (2) the distribution platform, (3) billing systems, (4) bad debt collection experience and (5) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews. 
Subscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.

Products and Services
Video Services
Our video service is, and continues to be, one of the key foundations of our product offerings in our markets. Our cable operations offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services starting with a basic video service. Subscribers to our basic video service pay a fixed monthly fee and receive digital or analog video channels (including a limited number of high definition (HD) channels) and several digital and analog radio channels and an electronic programming guide. In our markets where our basic digital service is unencrypted (Germany, Austria, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Romania), the cost of our digital service is the same cost as the monthly fee of our analog service. In the markets where we encrypt our basic digital service, our digital service is generally offered at an incremental cost equal to or slightly higher than the monthly fee for our basic analog service. We tailor our video services in each country of operation based on programming preferences, culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements. 
We also offer a variety of premium channel packages to meet the special interests of our subscribers. For an additional monthly charge, a subscriber may upgrade to one of our extended digital tier services and receive an increased number of video and radio channels, including the channels in the basic tier service and additional HD channels. Digital subscribers may also subscribe to one or more packages of premium channels for an additional monthly charge. Our channel offerings include general entertainment, sports, movies, documentaries, lifestyles, news, adult, children and ethnic and foreign channels. 
Subscribers to our digital services also receive the channels available through our analog service. We offer limited analog video services in all of our broadband markets, except in the U.K., Germany, Switzerland and Austria. In all of our broadband operations, we continue to upgrade our systems to expand our digital services and encourage our analog subscribers to convert to a digital or premium digital service.
Discounts to our monthly service fees are available to any subscriber who selects a bundle of two or more of our services (Bundled services): video, internet, fixed-line telephony and, in certain markets, mobile services. Bundled services consist of double-play for two services, triple-play for three services and, where available, quad-play for four services. 
To meet customer demands, we have enhanced our video services with various products that enable our customers to control when, where and how they watch their programming.  These products range from digital video recorders (DVRs) to multimedia home gateway systems such as "Horizon TV", as well as various mobile applications (apps). Horizon TV is a next generation multimedia home gateway (decoder box) based on a digital television platform that is capable of distributing video, voice and data content throughout the home and to multiple devices. It has a sophisticated user interface that enables customers to view and share, across multiple devices, linear channels, video-on-demand (VoD) programming and personal media content and to pause, replay and record programming. The Horizon TV gateway can act as an internet router that allows access to digital video content available on the television via other devices, such as laptops, smart phones and tablets. 
For our Horizon TV subscribers, we offer various features and functionalities, including television apps for various online services (such as YouTube, Netflix, social platforms, sports experience, music, news and games). In almost all of our operations, we also offer an online mobile app for viewing on a second screen called “Horizon Go”. Horizon Go is available on mobile devices (iOS, Android and Windows) and via an internet portal and allows video customers to view linear channels and VoD, with a substantial part of this content available outside of the home. For Horizon TV customers, when in the home the second screen device can act as a remote control. Through Horizon Go, customers have the ability to remotely schedule the recording of a television program on their Horizon TV box at home. 
We offer Horizon TV in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Poland and the Czech Republic. In several of our other European operations, we provide a Horizon TV-like experience through a remote upgrade of the software on the customer’s set-top box. After the upgrade, these boxes offer several features of the Horizon TV product. We refer to this upgrade as “Horizon Lite”, although it is locally marketed as Horizon TV, except in Belgium where it is marketed as “Digital TV”. Some of the Horizon TV features are not available on our Horizon Lite systems, such as recommendation-based content and the ability to access video content on other devices in the home. We intend to continue to improve the Horizon TV user experience with new functionality and software updates. 
In the U.K., we offer a multimedia home gateway based on the TiVo platform under a strategic partnership agreement with TiVo Inc.  The TiVo set-top boxes provide television and broadband internet capabilities. In late 2016, we launched a new set-top box in the U.K. called the Virgin Media V6 box. This device combines ultra high-definition 4K video, including high dynamic range, with improved streaming functionalities and more processing power. The Virgin Media V6 box allows customers to record six channels simultaneously while watching a seventh. Customers can also start watching programming on one television and pick up where they left off on other TiVo boxes in another room or through an app on their smart phones and tablets. In addition to the 
I-14

video service on their TiVo gateway device, our customers in the U.K. also have access to a comprehensive internet streaming video service called “Virgin TV Go”. This service, which is available via a mobile app or an internet portal, allows our video customers to stream real-time TV channels and watch VoD content anywhere they have a broadband connection. 
We intend to roll out a counterpart of the Virgin Media V6 in our other operations, which we call “EOS”. EOS will carry the next generation Horizon TV user interface and will be marketed under respective local brands where it is deployed. 
In Belgium, the digital video product offered by Telenet is marketed as “Digital TV”. It functions similarly to our Horizon Lite service and is available to Telenet's enhanced video subscribers for no additional charge. Telenet also offers customers access to live TV streaming and various other content sources such as VoD via the “Yelo Play” app, which is available via iOS, Android and Windows smart phones and tablets. Digital TV set-top boxes and Yelo Play offer a Horizon-like user interface that allow Telenet's enhanced video customers to remotely manage their DVR, view programs remotely (up to seven days after the original broadcast) and access VoD with a laptop, smart phone or tablet in or out of the home. 
One of our key video services is “Replay TV”. Replay TV records virtually all programs across numerous linear channels in the countries where this service is available. The recordings are available up to seven days after the original broadcast. This allows our customers to catch up on their favorite television shows without having to set their DVR or browse separate menus on their set-top boxes. Instead, customers can open the electronic programing guide, scroll back and replay linear programming instantly. Replay TV also allows our customers to replay a television program from the start even while the live broadcast is in progress. Replay TV is accessible in all of our markets, except in the U.K. and Germany, through Horizon TV or Horizon Lite, and in some of our markets also via Horizon Go. 
In most of our markets, we offer transactional VoD giving subscribers access to thousands of movies and television series. In several of our markets, our subscription VoD service is included in our enhanced video services accessed through the Horizon TV platform. This service is tailored to the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and competitive offers and includes various programming, such as music, kids, documentaries, adult, sports and TV series. In Germany, subscription VoD is available through a partnership with maxdome, and in Belgium, the service is marketed as “Play” and “Play More”. We continue to develop our VoD services to provide a growing collection of programming from local and international suppliers, such as ABC/Disney, A+E Networks, NBC/Universal, CBS/Paramount, Discovery, the BBC, Warner and Sony, among others. Customers who subscribe to an extended digital tier generally receive a VoD enabled set-top box without an additional monthly charge. 
Subscribers access our enhanced video service by renting a set-top box with a smart card from our operators, or without a set-top box if a subscriber is only using our basic video service. Where Horizon TV is available, a subscriber to our enhanced video services has the option, for an incremental monthly charge, to upgrade the standard digital set-top box to a Horizon TV box (which has HD DVR capabilities and other additional features). No set-top box or smart card, however, is required to receive our basic digital services in our unencrypted footprints. In addition, expanded channel packages and premium channels and services are available for an incremental monthly fee in all of our markets.
WiFi and Internet Services
Connectivity is a building block for vibrant communities. As the largest international cable company, our fiber-rich broadband network is the backbone of our business and the basis of our connectivity strategy. To meet our customers’ expectations to be seamlessly connected, we are investing in the expansion of our broadband network, mobile and WiFi solutions and customer premises equipment.
Internet speed is of crucial importance to our customers, as they spend more time streaming video and other bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. Our extensive broadband network enables us to deliver ultra high-speed internet service across our markets. Our residential subscribers access the internet via cable modems connected to their internet capable devices, or wirelessly via a WiFi gateway device. We offer multiple tiers of broadband internet service ranging from a basic service of 10 Mbps in Germany and Switzerland to an ultra high-speed internet service of 500 Mbps in Switzerland, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The speed of service depends on the location and the tier of service selected. In addition, by leveraging our existing fiber-rich broadband networks and our Network Extension programs, we are in position to deliver gigabit services by deploying the next generation DOCSIS 3.1 technology. We plan to launch this technology in 2018. By using DOCSIS 3.1, we have the potential to extend our download speeds to at least 1 Gbps when fully deployed. DOCSIS technology is an international standard that defines the requirements for data transmission over a cable system. Currently, our ultra high-speed internet service is based primarily on DOCSIS 3.0 technology. 
Our internet service generally includes email, address book and parental controls. We offer value-added broadband services in certain of our markets for an incremental charge. These services include security (e.g., anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall and 
I-15

spam protection) and online storage solutions and web spaces. In many of our markets, we offer mobile broadband services with internet access as described below. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee based on the tier of service selected. In addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon subscribing to an internet service. This one-time fee may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of speed, market conditions and other factors. 
Our "Connect Box" is a dedicated connectivity device that delivers superior in-home WiFi coverage.  It is our next generation WiFi and telephony gateway that enables us to maximize the impact of our ultrafast broadband networks by providing reliable wireless connectivity anywhere in the home. It has an automatic WiFi optimization function, which selects the best possible wireless frequency at any given time. This gateway can be self-installed and allows customers to customize their home WiFi service. Our Connect Box is available in all our markets. Robust wireless connectivity is increasingly important with our customers spending more and more time using bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. In Belgium and Switzerland, we also offer a connect app that allows our customers to find their best WiFi access.
In almost all of our markets, we have deployed community WiFi via routers in the home (the Community WiFi), which provides a secure access to the internet for our customers. Community WiFi is enabled by a cable modem WiFi access point (WiFi modem) in the Connect Box, the set-top box or the Horizon TV box of our internet customers. The Community WiFi is created through the sharing of access to the public channel of our customers’ home wireless routers. Use of the Community WiFi does not affect the internet speeds of our customers. The public channel is a separate network from the secure private network used by the customer within the home and is automatically enabled when the WiFi modem is installed. Access is free for our internet customers. At December 31, 2017, we had 9.1 million WiFi access points in our footprint. In addition, our internet customers continue to have access to the Community WiFi in the Netherlands. We continue to expand our Community WiFi service throughout our markets, including access points covering public places. 
Public WiFi access points (covering train stations, hotels, bars, restaurants and other public places) are available to Virgin Media customers in the U.K., Unitymedia GmbH (Unitymedia) customers in Germany and to Telenet customers in Belgium. In Switzerland, Belgium, Hungary, Poland, Ireland and Romania, we are expanding our Community WiFi through access points covering public places. Our Community WiFi is branded as “Wi-Free” in most of our markets. Through an agreement with Comcast Corporation, our internet customers also have access to millions of WiFi access points in the U.S. and across various European countries for no additional cost.
Mobile Services
Mobile services are another key building block for us to provide customers with seamless connectivity. We offer mobile services as an MVNO over third-party networks in the U.K., Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Poland and Hungary. Following the February 2016 acquisition of BASE, Telenet became a mobile network provider in Belgium and is migrating its mobile subscribers to the BASE network prior to the termination of its MVNO agreement with a third-party provider at the end of 2018. Although, Telenet’s MVNO arrangement continues through 2018, Telenet aims to complete the migration of its MVNO subscribers by the end of the first half of 2018. We plan to add MVNO arrangements and, where appropriate, acquire or partner with mobile service providers with their own networks in all our broadband communication markets. 
In Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Hungary and, through 2018, Belgium, we provide our mobile telephony services as full MVNOs through partnerships with a third-party mobile network operator in their respective footprints of our country operations. All of these operations lease the third-party’s radio access network and own the core network, including switching, backbone and interconnections. These arrangements permit us to offer our customers in these markets mobile services without having to build and operate a cellular radio tower network. In 2017, our mobile operations in the U.K. moved from a light MVNO to a full MVNO arrangement due to a revised agreement with the third-party network provider. The migration of our U.K. mobile customers to the full MVNO arrangement is expected to be completed in 2019. In Germany and Poland, we provide mobile telephony as a light MVNO. In this case, we lease the core network as well as the radio access network from a mobile network operator. This arrangement permits our German customers to have access to the third-party mobile communications services while we maintain the customer relationship.

Switzerland | Salt (1) 
Austria | Three (Hutchison)
Ireland | Three (Hutchison)
Hungary | Vodafone 
Germany | Telefonica 
Poland | Orange/Play 

____________
(1) UPC Switzerland will migrate to the Swisscom AG (Swisscom) network the beginning of 2019.

Where mobile services are available subscribers pay varying monthly fees depending on whether the mobile service is combined with our cable services or includes mobile data services via mobile phones, tablets or laptops. We offer our customers the option to purchase mobile handsets and, in most of our markets, make such purchase pursuant to a contract independent of their mobile services contract. We refer to these arrangements as split contracts. In Belgium, for those subscribers on Telenet’s own network, it is offering more flexible bundles adjusted to customers’ needs so they can use the full capacity of their package, regardless of their appetite to use either more data, minutes or text messages.
Our mobile services typically include voice, short message service (or SMS) and internet access. Calls, both within and out of network, incur a charge or are covered under a postpaid monthly service plan. Our mobile services are primarily on a postpaid basis with customers subscribing to services for periods ranging from activation for a SIM-only contract to up to 24 months (or 36 months in the U.K.), with the latter often taken with a subsidized mobile handset. In Belgium, Switzerland and Austria, however, our postpaid service is offered without a minimum contract term. In the U.K. and Belgium, we also offer a prepaid service, where the customers pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime or data and generally have no minimum contract term. In almost all of our markets, subscribers to a double- or triple-play bundle receive a discount on their mobile service fee. 
Telephony Services
Multi-feature telephony services are available through VoIP technology in most of our broadband communication markets. In the U.K. and Hungary, we also provide traditional circuit-switched telephony services. We pay interconnect fees to other telephony and internet providers when calls by our subscribers terminate on another network and receive similar fees from providers when calls by their users terminate on our network through interconnection points. 
Our telephony service may be selected in several of our markets on a standalone basis and in all of our markets in combination with one or more of our other services. Our telephony service includes a basic fixed-line telephony product for line rental and various calling plans, which may consist of any of the following: unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. We also offer value added services, such as a personal call manager, unified messaging and a second or third phone line at an incremental cost. 
Multiple Dwelling Units and Partner Networks
Approximately two-thirds of Unitymedia’s video customers are in multiple dwelling units where Unitymedia has the billing relationship with the landlord or housing association or with a third-party (Professional Operator) that operates and administers the in-building network on behalf of housing associations. Many of these agreements allow Unitymedia to offer its digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services directly to the end customer. Professional Operators may procure the basic video signals from Unitymedia at volume-based discounts and will generally resell them to housing associations with whom the operator maintains the customer relationship. Unitymedia has entered into agreements with Professional Operators, such as Tele Columbus Multimedia GmbH, that allow Unitymedia to market its digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services directly to the Professional Operator’s subscriber base. 
Pursuant to an agreement executed on June 28, 2008 (the PICs Agreement) with four associations of municipalities in Belgium (the pure intercommunales or PICs), Telenet leases the PICs broadband communications network and, accordingly, makes its services available to all of the homes passed by the cable network owned by the PICs. Telenet has a direct customer relationship with the basic and enhanced video subscribers on the PICs network. Pursuant to the PICs Agreement, Telenet has full rights to use substantially all of the PICs network under a long-term capital lease. Unless extended, the PICs Agreement will expire on 
I-17

September 23, 2046, and cannot be terminated earlier (except in the case of non-payment or bankruptcy of Telenet). For additional information on the PICs Agreement, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For approximately two-thirds of the basic video subscribers in UPC Holding’s Switzerland operations (UPC Switzerland), UPC Switzerland maintains billing relationships with landlords or housing associations and provides basic video service to the tenants. The landlord or housing association administers the billing for the basic video service with their tenants and manages service terminations for their rental units. When tenants select triple-play bundles with or without mobile service from UPC Switzerland, they then migrate to a direct billing relationship with us.
UPC Switzerland offers enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony services directly to the video cable subscribers of those partner networks that enter into service operating contracts with UPC Switzerland. UPC Switzerland has the direct customer billing relationship with these subscribers. By permitting UPC Switzerland to offer some or all of its enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony products directly to those partner network subscribers, UPC Switzerland’s service operating contracts have expanded the addressable markets for UPC Switzerland’s digital products. In exchange for the right to provide digital products directly to the partner network subscribers, UPC Switzerland pays to the partner network a share of the revenue generated from those subscribers. UPC Switzerland also provides network maintenance services and engineering and construction services to its partner networks.
Business Services
In addition to our residential services, we offer business services in all of our operations. For business and public sector organizations, we provide a complete range of voice, advanced data, video, wireless and cloud-based services, as well as mobile and converged fixed-mobile services. Our business customers include SOHO (generally up to five employees), small business and medium and large enterprises. We also provide business services on a wholesale basis to other operators. 
Our business services are designed to meet the specific demands of our business customers with a wide range of services, including increased data transmission speeds and virtual private networks. These services fall into five broad categories: 

• | VoIP and circuit-switch telephony, hosted private branch exchange solutions and conferencing options;


• | data services for internet access, virtual private networks and high capacity point-to-point services;


• | wireless services for mobile voice and data, as well as managed WiFi networks;


• | video programming packages and select channel lineups for targeted industries; and


• | value added services, including webhosting, managed security systems and storage and cloud enabled software.

Our intermediate to long-term strategy is to enhance our capabilities and offerings in the business sector so we become a preferred provider in the business market. To execute this strategy, customer experience and strategic marketing play a key role.
Our business services are provided to customers at contractually established prices based on the size of the business, type of services received and the volume and duration of the service agreement. SOHO and small business customers pay business market prices on a monthly subscription basis to receive enhanced service levels and business features that support their needs. For more advanced business services, these customers generally enter into a service agreement. For medium to large business customers, we enter into individual agreements that address their needs. These agreements are generally for a period of at least one year. 
Investments—VodafoneZiggo JV
We own a 50% interest in the VodafoneZiggo JV, which is a leading Dutch company that provides fixed, mobile and integrated communication and entertainment services to consumers and businesses in the Netherlands. In connection with the formation of the VodafoneZiggo JV, we entered into a shareholders agreement with Vodafone providing for the governance of the VodafoneZiggo JV, including decision-making process, information access, dividend policy and non-compete provisions. It also provides for restrictions on transfer of interests in the VodafoneZiggo JV and exit arrangements. Under the dividend policy, the VodafoneZiggo JV is required to distribute all unrestricted cash to Vodafone and us, subject to minimum cash requirements and financing arrangements. We also entered into a framework agreement with the VodafoneZiggo JV to provide access to each partner’s expertise in the telecommunications business. For additional information on the above agreements, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The fiber-rich broadband network of the VodafoneZiggo JV passes 7.1 million homes. The VodafoneZiggo JV also offers nationwide mobile coverage. At December 31, 2017, the VodafoneZiggo JV had nearly 14.6 million subscribers of which nearly 4.0 million were video, over 3.0 million were fixed broadband internet, approximately 2.5 million were fixed-line telephony and 
I-18

5.0 million were mobile (including 4.1 million postpaid). In addition to its residential services, the VodafoneZiggo JV offers extensive business services throughout the Netherlands. The operations of the VodafoneZiggo JV are subject to various regulations, which are described below under Regulatory Matters—The Netherlands. 
The VodafoneZiggo JV’s customers continue to have access to Horizon TV and its functionalities (marketed as Ziggo TV), including Replay TV, 400 Mbps nationwide broadband internet and an extensive WiFi Community network. They also have access to Vodafone’s nationwide long-term evolution wireless service, also called “4G” (referred to herein as LTE) services, under either a prepaid or postpaid service plan. With its mobile services, the VodafoneZiggo JV is able to offer its customers quad-play bundles and converged services to residential and business customers.
For all its services, the VodafoneZiggo JV competes primarily with the provision of similar services from the incumbent telecommunications operator Koninklijke KPN N.V. (KPN). KPN offers (1) internet protocol television (IPTV) over fiber optic lines where the fiber is to the home, cabinet, or building or to the node networks (fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-building/-node is referred to herein as FTTx) networks and through broadband internet connections using DSL or very high-speed DSL technology (VDSL) or an enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring”, (2) digital terrestrial television (DTT), and (3) LTE services. Where KPN has enhanced its VDSL system, it offers broadband internet with download speeds of up to 100 Mbps and on its FTTx networks, it offers download speeds of up to 500 Mbps. Its ability to offer a bundled triple-play of video, broadband internet and telephony services and fixed-mobile convergence services, creates significant competitive pressure on the VodafoneZiggo JV’s operations, including the pricing and bundling of its video products. KPN’s video services include many of the interactive features the VodafoneZiggo JV offers its subscribers. Portions of the VodafoneZiggo JV’s network have been overbuilt by KPN’s and other providers’ FTTx networks and expansion of these networks is expected to continue.

Additional Business Information
Technology 
In most of our markets, our video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services are transmitted over a hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. This network is composed primarily of national and regional fiber networks, which are connected to the home over the last few hundred meters by coaxial cable. Over 99% of our network allows for two-way communications and is flexible enough to support our current services as well as new services. 
We closely monitor our network capacity and customer usage. Where necessary, we increase our capacity incrementally, for instance by splitting nodes in our cable network. We also continue to explore improvements to our services and new technologies that will enhance our customer’s connected entertainment experience. These actions include:

• | recapturing bandwidth and optimizing our networks by:

As stated under General Development of Business—Expansion and Acquisitions above, we are expanding our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network through our Network Extension programs. In addition, we are seeking mobile service opportunities where we have established cable networks and expanding our fixed-line networks where we have a strong mobile offering. This will allow us to offer converged fixed-line and mobile services to our customers. 
We deliver high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our broadband network in our markets. The cable networks of our operations in Europe are connected to our “Aorta” backbone. The Aorta backbone is recognized as a Tier 1 Carrier, which permits us to serve our customers through settlement free collaboration with other carriers without the cost of using a third-party network. 
In support of our connectivity strategy, we are moving our customers into a gigabit society. Almost all of our broadband networks are already capable of supporting the next generation of ultra high-speed internet service at gigabit speeds. To provide these speeds to our subscribers, we are launching our next generation gateways that will enable DOCSIS 3.1 technology throughout our footprint. The launch of DOCSIS 3.1 technology will provide us significantly higher efficiencies on our networks and allow us to offer faster speeds, in-home WiFi and better services. Our Unitymedia operations have already demonstrated that download speeds of 2 Gbps can be achieved on our network. The new gateways and the continued upgrades to our network in the coming years will allow us to maximize high-speed connectivity over our broadband networks and deliver gigabit services in a cost-effective manner. It will also allow us to meet the expectations of our customers for high-speed internet access both in cities and rural areas of our footprint.

Supply Sources
Content. With telecommunication companies increasingly offering similar services, content is one of the deciding factors for customers in selecting a video services provider. Therefore, in addition to providing services that allow our customers to view programming when and where they want, we are investing in content that customers want. Our content strategy is based on: 

• | proposition (exceeding our customers' entertainment desires and expectations);


• | product (delivering the best content available);


• | procurement (investment in the best brands, shows and sports); and


• | partnering (strategic alignment, acquisitions and growth opportunities).

We license almost all of our programming and on-demand offerings from content providers and third-party rights holders, including broadcasters and cable programming networks. For such licenses, we generally pay a monthly fee on a per channel or per subscriber basis, with minimum pay guarantees in certain cases. We generally enter into long-term programming licenses with volume discounts and marketing support. For on-demand programming and streaming services, we generally enter into shorter-term agreements. For our distribution agreements, we seek to include the rights to offer the licensed programming to our customers through multiple delivery platforms and through our apps for smart phones and tablets. 
In seeking licenses for content, our primary focus is on partnering with leading international providers, such as Disney, Time Warner (including HBO), Fox, the BBC and Discovery. We also seek to carry in each of our markets key public and private broadcasters and in some markets we acquire local premium programing through select relationships with companies such as Sky plc (Sky) (U.K., Ireland, Germany and Austria) and British Telecom (BT). For our VoD services, we license a variety of programming, including box sets of television series, movies, music, kids and documentaries. In addition, we have entered into a multi-year arrangement with Netflix Inc. (Netflix) to provide our customers with premium OTT services. Through this arrangement, Netflix's content is available via set-top boxes to our video customers across many of our markets. The Netflix app is available to our customers in the U.K., Germany, Ireland and Switzerland. It is also available to the VodafoneZiggo JV’s customers.
Exclusive content is another element of our content strategy. To support this approach, we are investing in content assets. We have invested in various content companies, including ITV plc, All3Media Ltd., LionsGate Entertainment, STX, TV3 Group (Ireland, to be rebranded as Virgin Media TV in the first half of 2018) and De Vijver Media. We are also investing in sports, both as a broadcaster and as a rights owner. We have launched our own exclusive sports channels, Play Sports in Belgium, and MySports in Switzerland, and the VodafoneZiggo JV owns the Ziggo Sport channel, which is available exclusively to the VodafoneZiggo JV’s customers. 
In addition, we are commissioning our own exclusive drama series content. Through All3Media Ltd., which we own jointly with Discovery Communications Inc., we are co-producing television series for all our markets. The first of these series, The Feed, is expected to be released in 2019. In addition, we have produced the Swiss sitcom Fassler-Kunz, the Swiss series Im Heimatland and the original Belgium series Chaussee d'Amour with local production companies. With LionsGate Entertainment, we are a partner in the production of a new spy thriller series The Rook. For each of these programs, the content will be available on demand to our customers. 
Customer Premises Equipment. We purchase each type of customer premises equipment from a number of different suppliers with at least two or more suppliers providing our high-volume products. Customer premises equipment includes set-top boxes, modems, WiFi routers, DVRs, tuners and similar devices. For each type of equipment, we retain specialists to provide customer support. For our broadband services, we use a variety of suppliers for our network equipment and the various services we offer. Similarly, we use a variety of suppliers for mobile handsets to offer our customers mobile services. 
Software Licenses. We license software products, including email and security software, and content, such as news feeds, from several suppliers for our internet services. The agreements for these products require us to pay a per subscriber fee for software licenses and a share of advertising revenue for content licenses. For our TiVo service in the U.K., we have a partnership arrangement where TiVo is the exclusive provider of the user interface software for our next generation set-top boxes, which provides converged television and broadband internet capabilities, and we are the exclusive distributor of the TiVo services and technology in the U.K. In 2017, we entered into a multi-year extension of our agreements with Tivo. For our mobile network operations and our fixed-line telephony services, we license software products, such as voicemail, text messaging and caller ID, from a variety of suppliers. For these licenses we seek to enter into long-term contracts, which generally require us to pay based on usage of the services.
I-21

Access Arrangements. Through Unitymedia, we have entered into various long-term agreements with the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom AG (Deutsche Telekom), for the lease of cable duct space and hubs, as well as use of fiber optic transmission systems, towers and facility space. In addition, Unitymedia purchases a portion of the electricity required for the operation of its networks through Deutsche Telekom under such agreements. Unitymedia’s ability to offer its broadband communications services to customers is dependent on the agreements with Deutsche Telekom. These agreements are long-term and may only be terminated under certain limited exceptions. Any termination, however, would have a material adverse effect on the operations of Unitymedia. For information on a legal action that Unitymedia commenced against Deutsche Telekom in December 2012 regarding these agreements, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For our mobile services provided through MVNO arrangements, we are dependent on third-party wireless network providers. Each of our MVNO operations has an agreement with such a provider to carry the mobile communications traffic of our customers. We seek to enter into medium to long-term arrangements for these services. Any termination of these arrangements could significantly impact our mobile services.
Competition
All of our businesses operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets. Technological advances and product innovations have increased and are likely to continue to increase giving customers several options for the provision of their telecommunications services. Our customers want access to high quality telecommunication services that allow for seamless connectivity. Accordingly, our ability to offer converged services (video, internet, fixed telephony and mobile) is a key component of our strategy. In many of our markets, we compete with companies that provide fixed-mobile convergence bundles, as well as companies that are established in one or more communication products and services. Consequently, our businesses face significant competition. In all markets, we seek to differentiate our telecommunication services by focusing on customer service, competitive pricing and offering quality high-speed internet. In this section, we begin with an overview on the competitive nature of the video, broadband internet, and mobile and fixed-line telephony services in our markets, and then provide information on key competitors in our more material markets.
We believe that our deep-fiber access provides us with several competitive advantages. For instance, our cable networks allow us to concurrently deliver internet access, together with real-time television and VoD content, without impairing our high-speed internet service. In addition, our cable infrastructure allows us to provide triple-play bundled services of broadband internet, television and fixed-line telephony services without relying on a third-party service provider or network. Where mobile is available, our mobile networks, together with our fixed fiber-rich networks, allow us to provide a comprehensive set of converged mobile and fixed-line services. Our capacity is designed to support peak consumer demand. In serving the business market, many aspects of the network can be leveraged at very low incremental costs given that business demand peaks at a time when consumer demand is low, and peaks at lower levels than consumer demand. 
Overall, we are experiencing increased convergence as customers look to receive all their media and communication services from one provider. In our largest video markets, our key competitors for the the provision of converged services are: BT (U.K.), Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Proximus NV/SA (Proximus) (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). Each of these competitors have extensive resources allowing them to offer competitively priced bundled services. As a result, our ability to offer triple-play or quad-play bundles and fixed-mobile convergence bundles is one of our key strategies to attract and retain customers. We seek to distinguish ourselves through our multimedia gateway services, interactive services (such as Replay TV and VoD), expanded content offers (for both in and out of the home) and our download speeds. 
Portions of our European systems have been overbuilt by FTTx networks and other cable operations. These systems are a significant competitive factor primarily for our Central and Eastern Europe operations. Based on research of various telecommunication publications, including by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and internal estimates, parts of our Central and Eastern Europe operations are overbuilt by FTTx networks, including almost all of our operations in Romania. Other fiber and cable operators have also overbuilt approximately three-quarters of our combined footprint in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, two-thirds of our foot print in Poland and half of our cable networks in Hungary. Although we have extensive FTTx overbuild in Switzerland, connectivity to the FTTx network is not available at all locations. In addition, government and quasi-government entities in certain of the countries in which we operate in Europe continue to invest in FTTx networks, creating another source of competition. 
In order to achieve download speeds of up to 100 Mbps or greater for customers, incumbent telecommunications operators are adopting VDSL with vectoring and bonding technologies as a more cost efficient solution compared to FTTx initiatives. Our primary competitor in Germany, Deutsche Telekom, has implemented VDSL technology in almost all of our footprint in Germany and is currently in the process of implementing vectoring technology. Swisscom is also implementing vectoring in Switzerland. 
I-22

Vectoring is a transmission method that coordinates line signals to reduce crosstalk levels and improve performance. Bonding is a method of taking channels on either DSL or cable plant and bonding those channels together for a higher bandwidth throughput. 
Video Distribution
Our video services compete primarily with traditional free-to-air (FTA) broadcast television services, DTH satellite service providers and other fixed-line telecommunications carriers and broadband providers, including incumbent telephony operations offering (1) DTH satellite services, (2) IPTV over broadband internet connections using asymmetric DSL or VDSL or an enhancement to VDSL  called "vectoring", (3) IPTV over FTTx networks, or (4) LTE Services. Many of these competitors have a national footprint and offer features, pricing and video services individually and in bundles comparable to what we offer. In certain markets, we also compete with other cable providers who have overbuilt portions of our systems. Mobile broadband has gained noticeable share of video subscribers, which is another competitive factor.
OTT video content aggregators utilizing our or our competitors' high-speed internet connections are also a significant competitive factor as are other video service providers that overlap our service areas. The OTT video aggregators (such as HBO Now, Amazon Prime and Netflix) offer VoD service for television series and movies, catch-up television and programming from broadcasters. Generally, the content libraries of such services are offered for a monthly fee. Typically these services are available on multiple devices in and out of the home. In some cases, OTT services are provided free-of-charge. To enhance our competitive position, we provide our subscribers with TV everywhere products and premium OTT video services through our online mobile apps, VoD and Replay TV services or our arrangement with Netflix. Our businesses also compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and entertainment, such as online entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/concerts and sporting events. 
Our ability to continue to attract and retain customers depends on our continued ability to acquire appealing content and services on acceptable terms and to have such content available on multiple devices and outside the home. Some competitors have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for certain programming, which limits the opportunities for other providers to offer such programs. Other competitors also have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for programs, but our operations have limited access to certain of such programming through select contracts with these companies, including Sky Deutschland AG, a subsidiary of Sky, in Germany and Austria and Sky and BT in the U.K. and Ireland. If exclusive content offerings increase through other providers, programming options could be a deciding factor for subscribers on selecting a video service. 
Similar to our technological advances to enhance our video services, our competitors are also improving their video platforms with next generation set-top boxes, TV everywhere products and other interactive services. Similarly, VDSL, which is either provided directly by the owner of the network or by a third-party, is a significant part of the competitive environment in many of our markets as are FTTx networks. In all of our markets, competitive video services are offered by the incumbent telecommunications operator, whose video strategies include IPTV over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks and, in some cases, DTH and DTT. The ability of incumbent operators to offer the triple-play of video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services and, in most countries, a quad-play with mobile services, is exerting competitive pressure on our operations, including the pricing and bundling of our video products. In order to gain video market share, the incumbent operators and alternative service providers in a number of our larger markets are pricing their DTT, IPTV or DTH video packages at a discount to the retail price of the comparable digital cable service.
In most of our Central and Eastern European markets, we face intense competition from DTH services. These DTH companies offer aggressively-priced packages of video content and in some cases offer triple-play packages. FTA broadcasters are also significant competitors in the Central and Eastern Europe markets. To stay competitive, UPC Holding’s DTH operations offer advanced services and functionality, including DVR and premium content, in most of our Central and Eastern European markets. It has also expanded these services to include a triple-play offer in Hungary. Our cable operations stay competitive by offering enhanced digital services, such as HD channel offerings, Horizon Go and expanded VoD services. These operations have also increased broadband internet speeds in their triple-play bundles to up to 500 Mbps. Promotional discounts are available, particularly on bundled options. 
We compete on value by offering advanced digital services, such as DVR functionality, HD, VoD, catch-up television, Replay TV, online mobile apps and multiscreen services and multimedia gateways. We also compete by accelerating the migration of our customers from analog to digital services, offering advanced digital features and attractive content packages, as well as bundled services, at reasonable prices. In each of the countries in which we operate, we also tailor our packages to include attractive channel offerings and offer recurring discounts for bundled services and loyalty contracts. In addition, from time to time, we modify our digital channel offerings to improve the quality of our programming. Where mobile voice and data are available, we focus on our converged service offerings at attractive prices. In our other operations, we use the triple-play bundle as a means of driving video, as well as other products where convenience and price can be leveraged across the portfolio of services. We also continue to 
I-23

enhance our Horizon TV product to meet our customers desire to view programming anytime and anywhere, such as new applications and expanding its availability in our markets. 

• | Virgin Media. Virgin Media’s digital television services compete primarily with FTA television and with Sky, the primary pay satellite television provider. Sky offers competitively priced triple-play and quad-play services in the U.K. and Ireland. Other significant competitors are BT and TalkTalk Telecom Group plc (TalkTalk) in the U.K. and Eircom Limited in Ireland, each of which offer triple-play services, as well as IPTV video services. Each of these competitors have multimedia home gateways.

Sky owns the U.K. rights to various entertainment, sports and movie programming content and channels. Sky is both a principal competitor in the pay-television market and an important supplier of content to us. Various Sky channels, including Sky Sports, are available over Sky’s satellite system and our cable networks, as well as via Sky’s apps and online players and other television platforms, and some of the channels are available on BT and TalkTalk platforms. Virgin Media distributes several basic and premium video channels supplied by Sky. BT is also both a principal competitor and an important supplier of content to us. BT owns premium BT Sport channels, providing a range of sports content, including football (soccer) from the English Premier League and exclusive rights to the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. The BT Sport channels are available on our cable network as well as our competitors’ networks. 
In this competitive market, Virgin Media is expanding its broadband network and promotes its 4K enabled Virgin Media V6 set-top box in the UK. In Ireland it offers Horizon TV and its functionalities (marketed as Virgin TV). The on-line streaming service Virgin TV Go is available throughout the Virgin Media footprint. In addition, Virgin Media’s ability to include mobile for its U.K. and Ireland customers for a low incremental fee creating a fixed-mobile convergence bundle is a key market offer. 

• | Unitymedia. Unitymedia’s primary competition is from FTA television received via satellite. Unitymedia’s primary competitor for pay TV services is the IPTV services over VDSL and FTTx and DTH of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom. Deutsche Telekom’s VDSL network covers approximately 68% of German homes and it continues to expand this coverage with plans to reach approximately 80% of German homes in 2018.

Deutsche Telekom offers competitively-priced bundles, including fixed-mobile convergence, and since 2016 became more aggressive on price, significantly lowering their promotional prices for double-play offers. In addition, Vodafone, also a competitor in Germany, bundles its IPTV service with its broadband offerings through Deutsche Telekom’s DSL network under a resell agreement making it a significant competitor in the double-play and triple-play market in our footprint. It also has expanded its bundle offers to include mobile products. These converged offerings may enable Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone to reduce churn and attract new customers.
Deutsche Telekom and Professional Operators compete with Unitymedia for housing association contracts. Professional Operators typically procure the broadcast signals they distribute from Unitymedia or from FTA television received via satellite. Certain Professional Operators may also use such opportunities to build their own distribution networks or to install their own head-ends for receiving satellite signals. 
To enhance its competitive position, Unitymedia offers Horizon TV and the Horizon family of products, including Horizon Go. It also makes mobile available creating converged bundles. Mobile customers receive a discount when they also subscribe to certain bundles. 

• | Telenet. Telenet’s principal competitor is Proximus, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which has interactive digital television, replay television, VoD and HD service as part of its video offer, as well as a remote access service. Proximus offers customers a wide range of both individual and bundled services at competitive prices. Also, Telenet and other Belgian cable operators must give alternative providers access to their cable networks. Orange Belgium N.V. (Orange Belgium) gained such access in 2016 and currently offers its mobile subscribers a dual play bundle, including enhanced video and broadband internet services. Telenet may face increased competition from other providers of video services who take advantage of the wholesale access and may be able to offer triple- and quad-play services. For more information on wholesale access, see Regulatory Matters—Belgium.

In order to compete effectively against alternative providers, Telenet leverages its extensive cable network, the broad acceptance of its basic cable television services and Yelo Play and its additional features, such as HD and DVR functionality, VoD offerings and its Play Sports channel. Telenet is able to offer international, national, regional and local content, including Dutch-language broadcasts, to its subscribers. It is also using mobile services to drive its other products through its converged offerings. In addition, Telenet continues to enhance its Yelo Play app and programming, including extending its rights to the English Premier League through 2019 and the addition of other sports rights. 
I-24


• | UPC Switzerland. Our main competitor in Switzerland is Swisscom, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which provides IPTV services over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks. Swisscom offers VoD services, DVR and replay functionality and HD channels, as well as the functionality to allow remote access to its video services, and has exclusive rights to distribute certain sports programming. To compete effectively in Switzerland, UPC Switzerland promotes Horizon TV and its family of products together with Replay TV and VoD, giving subscribers the ability to personalize their programming and viewing preferences. It also uses its high-speed internet of up to 50, 200 or 500 Mbps to promote its extended digital tier bundles.

Internet
With respect to broadband internet services and online content, our businesses face competition in a rapidly evolving marketplace from incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications companies, mobile operators and cable-based ISPs, many of which have substantial resources. The internet services offered by these competitors include both fixed-line broadband internet services using cable, DSL or FTTx networks and wireless broadband internet services. These competitors have a range of product offerings with varying speeds and pricing, as well as interactive services, data and other non-video services offered to homes and businesses. With the demand for mobile internet services increasing, competition from wireless services using various advanced technologies is a competitive factor. In several of our markets, competitors offer high-speed mobile data via LTE wireless networks. In addition, other wireless technologies, such as WiFi, are available in almost all of our markets. In this intense competitive environment, speed and pricing are key drivers for customers. 
Our strategy is speed leadership. Our focus is on increasing the maximum speed of our connections as well as offering varying tiers of service, prices and a variety of bundled product offerings and a range of value added services. We update our bundles and packages on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of our customers. Our top download internet speeds range from up to 300 Mbps in the U.K. and Austria to speeds of up to 500 Mbps available in Switzerland, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. We use our ultra high-speed internet services with access to Community WiFi and competitively priced bundles to encourage customers from other providers to switch to our services. The focus is on high-end internet products to safeguard our high-end customer base and allow us to become more aggressive at the low- and medium-end of the internet market. By fully utilizing the technical capabilities of DOCSIS 3.0 technology on our cable systems, we can compete with local FTTx initiatives and create a competitive advantage compared to DSL infrastructures and LTE initiatives on a national level. With the commercial deployment of our next generation gateways that will enable DOCSIS 3.1 on our cable networks, we plan to further improve our high-speed internet offers. 
Across Europe, our key competition in this product market is from the offering of broadband internet products using various DSL-based technologies by the incumbent phone companies and third parties. The introduction of cheaper and ever faster fixed-line broadband offerings is further increasing the competitive pressure in this market. Wireless broadband services, such as LTE, are also significant competitors using high-speed mobile networks. We are expanding our ultra high-speed services and increasing our download speeds. In most of our markets, we offer our internet service on a standalone basis or through bundled offerings that include video, fixed-line telephony and mobile services. Mobile data is also increasingly important and we are addressing this through our wide range of mobile products, including expanding our LTE service area and offering SIM-only mobile products, as well as expanding our Community WiFi network.

• | Virgin Media. In the U.K., we have a number of significant competitors in the market for broadband internet services, including fixed-line incumbent telecommunications providers. Of these broadband internet providers, BT is the largest, which provides broadband internet access services to both its own retail customers and third-party retail providers over its own DSL network. BT has announced its intention to rollout ultrafast speeds of up to at least 300 Mbps by the end of 2020 to up to 10.0 million premises using G.fast technology, a DSL standard applied over copper local loops. BT has also announced that it intends to rollout a FTTx service supporting 1 Gbps to two million homes and businesses by 2020. As a result of these objectives, BT recently launched a range of ultrafast packages offering speeds of up to 150 Mbps and 300 Mbps, respectively, using a combination of G.fast and FTTx technology, which are currently available to 250,000 U.K. homes.

Operators such as Sky and TalkTalk deploy their own network access equipment in BT exchanges via a process known as local loop unbundling (LLU). This allows an operator to reduce the recurring operating costs charged by BT by reducing the proportion of traffic that must travel directly over BT’s network. LLU deployment requires a substantial capital investment to implement and requires a large customer base to deliver a return on investment. In addition to the competition and pricing pressure in the broadband market arising from LLU, competition from mobile broadband developments, such as LTE mobile services and WiFi services, is significant. Mobile providers continue to gain market share from fixed-line providers. These providers offer a range of mobile services.
I-25


• | Unitymedia. In Germany, the market for broadband internet services is highly competitive. For broadband internet access, DSL is the dominant technology and Deutsche Telekom is the primary provider. Other major competitors to our services are resellers of Deutsche Telekom’s DSL and VDSL services. We also face increased competition from mobile broadband operators, including Deutsche Telekom, and other network providers, many of which offer mobile services through LTE wireless systems and are increasing their coverage areas. Deutsche Telekom plans to cover approximately 80% of German homes with its VDSL network by 2018. Within its footprint, Deutsche Telekom is implementing vectoring technology, which increases broadband speeds to up to 100 Mbps from the current speeds of up to 50 Mbps. Deutsche Telekom further announced its ambition to implement super vectoring technology, enhancing broadband speeds to up to 250 Mbps.With its (vectored) VDSL expansion plan, competition from Deutsche Telekom will increase.


• | Telenet. In the Flanders region of Belgium, Telenet is the leading provider of residential broadband internet services. Telenet’s primary competitor is the DSL service provider Proximus. Proximus is a well-established competitor offering quad-play bundles. Proximus’ DSL and VDSL service provide download speeds up to 100 Mbps. Mobile broadband penetration is increasing as well, reaching nearly 66% of the total population based on the BIPT 2016 Annual Report. Similar to its video services, Telenet faces competition in the provision of internet services from other providers who have wholesale access to Telenet’s cable network. Through such access, Orange Belgium currently offers its mobile subscribers a dual-play bundle including enhanced video and broadband internet services. In this competitive market, Telenet is using its fixed-mobile converged offers to promote its internet and other services.


• | UPC Switzerland. In Switzerland, Swisscom is the largest provider of broadband internet services, and is our primary competitor. Swisscom internet customers have access to its basic video content free of charge through its internet portal. It is also expanding its FTTx network and rolling out G.fast technology. At year end 2016, it had 2.5 million new connections through these technologies. Swisscom offers download speeds ranging from 40 Mbps to up to 1 Gbps. Swisscom’s internet speeds include 40 Mbps to 100 Mbps on its VDSL network and up to 1 Gbps in areas served by its FTTx network. Swisscom continues to expand its FTTx network to Switzerland households in our footprint, as well as in our partner network footprints. It has built its FTTH network in several cities in cooperation with municipality-owned utility companies and, where no cooperation agreement has been reached, Swisscom is building its own FTTH network. With respect to subscribers on partner networks, UPC Switzerland competes with other service providers for the contracts to serve these subscribers. In this competitive market, UPC Switzerland increased it introductory speed to 50 Mbps and is promoting its broadband services through its bundled offers. 

Mobile and Telephony Services 
Consumers are increasingly moving to mobile services. In Belgium, as a mobile network operator, and in the U.K. through an MVNO arrangement, we are one of the largest mobile providers in each of these countries based on number of SIM cards. In our other European markets, however, we currently have minimal mobile presence. In the markets where we are a large mobile provider, we continue to seek additional bandwidth to deliver our wide range of services to our customers and increase our LTE services. Where we are a small mobile provider, we face significant competition from other mobile telephony providers, many of whom offer LTE services and are making significant advances in obtaining customers. In all of our markets competition is intense. We offer various calling plans, such as unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. In addition, we use our bundled offers with our video and ultra high-speed internet services to gain mobile subscribers. Our ability to offer fixed-mobile convergence services is a key driver. In several of our markets we provide converged services, including mobile, fixed-line, broadband and video. We are also exploring opportunities to offer mobile services in our other markets and mobility applications to our other services. 
The market for fixed-line telephony services is mature in almost all of our markets. Changes in market share are driven by the combination of price and quality of services provided and the inclusion of telephony services in bundled offerings. Our fixed-line telephony services compete against the incumbent telecommunications operator in the applicable market. In these markets, the operators have substantially more experience in providing fixed-line telephony and mobile services, greater resources to devote to the provision of fixed-line telephony services and long-standing customer relationships. In all of our markets, we also compete with other VoIP operators offering service across broadband lines. OTT telephony is also a competitive factor. Our businesses also face competition from other cable telephony providers, FTTx-based providers or other indirect access providers. 
Competition in both the residential and business fixed-line telephony markets is extremely competitive due to market trends, the offering of carrier pre-select services, number portability, the replacement of fixed-line with mobile telephony and the growth of VoIP services, as well as continued deregulation of telephony markets and general price competition. Carrier pre-select allows the end user to choose the voice services of operators other than the incumbent while using the incumbent’s network. Our fixed-line telephony strategy is focused around value leadership, and we position our services as “anytime” or “any destination”. Our portfolio of calling plans include a variety of innovative calling options designed to meet the needs of our subscribers. In many 
I-26

of our markets, we provide product innovation, such as telephone apps that allow customers to make and receive calls from their fixed-line call packages on smart phones. In addition, we offer varying plans to meet customer needs and, similar to our mobile services, we use our telephony bundle options with our digital video and internet services to help promote our telephony services and flat rate offers are standard. 
The incumbent telecommunication companies remain our key competitors but mobile operators and other VoIP operators, including ISPs, offering service across broadband lines are also significant competitors in these markets. Due to the maturity of the telephony market, competition is particularly intense in all our markets with price often the deciding factor. To maintain or increase market share, we and our competitors focus on bundling telephony services with quality broadband offerings and other services. In each of our markets, we face competition with a dominant fixed-line telephony provider, most of which also have competitive mobile offers based on LTE services. In our largest markets, the key dominant telephony providers are BT (UK), Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Proximus (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). These telephony competitors are also the largest mobile operators in these markets based on number of SIM cards, except in Germany where Telefonica O2 is the largest. These competitors include their mobile products in bundles with fixed-line services. Generally, we expect telephony markets to remain extremely competitive. 
Regulatory Matters 
Overview
Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated in each of the countries in which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the European Union (E.U.).
Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and type of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.
Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the U.K. are the Member States of the E.U. as of December 31, 2017. As such, these countries are required to harmonize certain of their laws with certain E.U. rules. In addition, other types of E.U. rules are directly enforceable in those countries without any implementation at the national level. Certain E.U. rules are also applicable across the European Economic Area, whose Member States are the E.U. Member States (excluding Croatia) as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway as of December 31, 2017. 
On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which U.K. citizens voted in favor of, on an advisory basis, an exit from the E.U. commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The terms of Brexit are subject to a negotiation period that could take until March 2019. The potential impacts, if any, of the uncertainty relating to Brexit or the resulting terms of Brexit on the free movement of goods, services and people and capital between the U.K. and the E.U., customer behavior, economic conditions, interest rates, currency exchange rates, availability of capital or other matters are unclear. In addition, the value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar remains at levels that are significantly below pre-Brexit levels. The effects of Brexit could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
In the broadcasting and communications sectors, there has been extensive E.U.-level legislative action. As a result, most of the markets in Europe in which our businesses operate have been significantly affected by the regulatory framework that has been developed by the E.U. Regulation in Switzerland, which is not a Member State of the E.U. and is not part of the European Economic Area, is discussed separately below, as well as regulation in certain Member States in which we face regulatory issues that may have a material impact on our business.
E.U. Communications Regulation
The body of E.U. law that deals with communications regulation consists of a variety of legal instruments and policies (collectively, the Regulatory Framework). The key elements of the Regulatory Framework are various legal measures and directives that require Member States to harmonize their laws, as well as certain other instruments and regulations that have direct effect without any specific adoption at the national level. 
I-27

The Regulatory Framework primarily seeks open communication services in markets within Europe. It harmonizes the rules within the E.U. for the establishment and operation of electronic communication networks, including cable television and traditional telephony networks, and the offer of electronic communication services, such as telephony, internet and, to some degree, television services. 
Set forth below are certain key provisions included in the current Regulatory Framework, as revised. This description is not intended to be a comprehensive or exhaustive description of all regulation in this area. 

• | Licensing and Exclusivity. The Regulatory Framework requires Member States to abolish exclusivities on communication networks and services in their territory and allow operators into their markets based on a simple registration. The Regulatory Framework sets forth an exhaustive list of conditions that may be imposed on communication networks and services. Possible obligations include, among other things, financial charges for universal service or for the costs of regulation, environmental requirements, data privacy and other consumer protection rules, “must carry” obligations, provision of customer information to law enforcement agencies and access obligations.


• | Significant Market Power. Certain of the obligations allowed by the Regulatory Framework apply only to operators or service providers with “Significant Market Power” (defined below) in a relevant market. For example, the provisions of the Access Directive allow the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) in E.U. Member States to mandate certain access obligations only for those operators and service providers that are deemed to have Significant Market Power. For purposes of the Regulatory Framework, an operator or service provider will be deemed to have Significant Market Power where, either individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a position of significant economic strength affording it the power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of competitors, customers and consumers.

As part of the implementation of certain provisions of the Regulatory Framework, each Member State’s NRA is required to analyze certain markets predefined by the European Commission to determine if any operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. The European Commission has currently recommended that there be four such predefined markets, which are subject to periodic review. NRAs may, however, perform analysis of markets not listed in the recommendation, which requires the NRA to prove that additional requirements, the so called three-criteria test, are met.
NRAs might seek to define us as having Significant Market Power in any of these predefined markets or they may define and analyze additional markets. In the event that we are found to have Significant Market Power in any particular market, an NRA could impose certain conditions on us. Under the Regulatory Framework, the European Commission has the power to veto a finding by an NRA of Significant Market Power (or the absence thereof), which power also applies with respect to market definition, in any market, regardless of whether it is a market predefined by the European Commission or an additional market defined by an NRA. We have been found to have Significant Market Power in certain markets in which we operate and further findings of Significant Market Power are possible. In particular, we have been found to have Significant Market Power in the market for termination of calls on our network.

• | Video Services. The regulation of distribution, but not the content, of television services to the public is harmonized by the Regulatory Framework. Member States are allowed to impose on certain operators under their jurisdiction reasonable must carry obligations for the transmission of specified radio and television broadcast channels. Such obligations are required to be based on clearly defined general interest objectives, be proportionate and be transparent and subject to periodic review. We are subject to must carry regulations in all markets in which we operate. Must carry regulations are significantly different among Member States. In some cases, these obligations go beyond what we believe is allowable under the Regulatory Framework. To date, however, the European Commission has taken very limited steps to enforce E.U. law in this area, leaving must carry obligations intact in certain Member States. We do not expect the European Commission or the Member States to curtail such obligations in the foreseeable future.


• | Net Neutrality/Traffic Management/Roaming. In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted the regulation on the first E.U.-wide net neutrality regime. The regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States, permits the provision of specialized services, optimized for specific content and subjects operators to reasonable traffic management requirements. The regulation also abolished roaming tariffs beginning in June 2017.

On May 6, 2015, the European Commission published its Digital Single Market strategy document. The strategy is an aggregation of many different policy areas with the purpose of creating a digital single market to expand jobs and stimulate growth. The strategy includes policy review in the areas of E.U. communications regulation, broadcasting law, copyright reform and anti-competitive geo-blocking practices. 
On September 14, 2016, the European Commission published a proposal for the European Electronic Communications Code, which would replace the Regulatory Framework. The proposal recognizes the need for greater incentives to boost private sector 
I-28

investment in very high capacity networks. The proposal maintains the key elements of the Regulatory Framework, notably market analysis with remedies only being imposed on operators with Significant Market Power. The European Council and European Parliament are discussing other forms of access—extending the system of symmetrical access powers and the notion of joint Significant Market Power. The proposal captures all types of services that are relevant to consumers, not only the traditional electronic communication services as captured under the current Regulatory Framework but also OTT services. The proposal brings greater harmonization to the timetables for spectrum licensing and renewal that will encourage investment in mobile networks and will result in more advanced services. The negotiations among the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament on the proposal are currently in process. The adoption of the proposal for the European Electronic Communications Code and its implementation in to national laws by Member States is not expected before the third quarter of 2018.
Broadcasting Law
Although the distribution of video channels by a cable operator is within the scope of the Regulatory Framework, the activities of a broadcaster are harmonized by other elements of E.U. law, in particular the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS). Generally, broadcasts originating in and intended for reception within an E.U. Member State must respect the laws of that Member State. Pursuant to AVMS, however, E.U. Member States are required to allow broadcast signals of broadcasters established in another E.U. Member State to be freely transmitted within their territory, so long as the broadcaster complies with the law of their home state. This is referred to as the country of origin principle. Under AVMS, the country of origin principle applies also to non-linear services, such as VoD. Accordingly, we should be able, if we so elect, to offer our own VoD services across the European Economic Area based on the regulation of the country of origin. As a result, we could structure our business to have a single regulatory regime for all of our VoD services offered in Europe. In addition, when we offer third-party VoD services on our network, it should be the business of the third-party, in its capacity as provider of the services, and not us as the local distributor, that is regulated in respect of these services. 
AVMS also establishes quotas for the transmission of European-produced programming and programs made by European producers who are independent of broadcasters. 
In May 2016, as part of its Digital Single Market strategy,the European Commission proposed revisions to the AVMS. The proposal maintains key elements of AVMS, notably the country of origin principle and European works quota. The adoption of the proposal for the revision of the AVMS is expected in mid-2018. Once adopted, its implementation into national laws by Member States will take place 12 to 24 months thereafter. 
According to the regulation of the European Commission addressing the portability of online audiovisual content services adopted in June 2017 and effective in April 2018, commercial providers of online content services (including OTT service providers) are required to enable subscribers who are temporarily present in any Member State with access and use of online content services in substantially the same manner as in the Member State of residence. 
Other European Level Regulation
In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, our operating companies must comply with both specific and general legislation concerning, among other matters, data retention and electronic commerce. In December 2015, the E.U. approved the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) with respect to data protection and retention. The GDPR enhanced existing legal requirements through several new rules and includes stiff penalties for organizations that fail to comply. The GDPR will be directly applicable in all Member States commencing in 2018. In addition, following the adoption of the GDPR, the European Commission published on January 11, 2017 a proposal for an e-Privacy regulation, replacing the current e-Privacy Directive that regulates privacy related issues in the electronic communications sector. The adoption of this proposal is not expected before June 2018.
Our operating companies are also subject to both national and European level regulations on competition and on consumer protection, which are broadly harmonized at the E.U. level. For example, while our operating companies may offer their services in bundled packages in European markets, they are sometimes not permitted to make a subscription to one service, such as cable television, conditional upon a subscription to another service, such as telephony. They may also face restrictions on the degree to which they may discount certain products included in the bundled packages. 
The European Commission is imposing more mandatory requirements and encouraging voluntary solutions regarding energy consumption of the telecommunications equipment we provide our customers. We have been participating in discussions and studies regarding energy consumption with the European Commission and with experts working on their behalf. In addition, we are working with suppliers of our digital set-top boxes to lower power consumption, as well as looking at possibilities through software to lower the power consumption of the existing fleet of digital set-top boxes. We also worked with a large group of companies to create a voluntary agreement on set-top box power consumption as an alternative to regulation, which has been 
I-29

formally recognized by the European Commission. Nevertheless, legislation in this area may be adopted that could adversely affect the cost and/or the functionality of equipment we deploy to customers. 
Pursuant to an E.U. Regulation on standby power (the Standby Regulation), many devices are required to have either a low power standby mode or off mode, unless it is inappropriate to have either such mode on the device. Furthermore, the Networked Standby amendment to the Standby Regulation, effective as of January 1, 2015, regulates, among others, the maximum power consumption of networked consumer equipment while in the so-called “Networked Standby” mode. As a result, all of the devices we purchase and/or develop, including Horizon TV set-top boxes, Connect Boxes and certain other equipment, operate under the power management requirements of the Standby Regulation. 
As part of the E.U.’s Radio Spectrum Policy Program, spectrum made available through the switch off of analog television has been approved for mobile broadband use beginning January 1, 2013. This spectrum, known as the “digital dividend”, is in the 700 - 862 MHz band. The terms under which this spectrum will become available will vary among the European countries in which we operate. Certain uses of this spectrum may interfere with services carried on our cable networks. If this occurs, we may need to: (1) avoid using certain frequencies on our cable networks for certain or all of our services, (2) make some changes to our networks, or (3) change the equipment that we deploy. In approving mobile broadband, however, the Radio Spectrum Policy Program states that the new mobile services must co-exist with existing services, such as cable and DTT, to avoid harmful interference. As a result, we are in ongoing discussions with relevant Member States and the European Commission to be included in LTE mobile trials in order to develop mitigation techniques and to engage NRAs to launch regulatory dialog with equipment manufacturers and mobile operators to develop co-existing networks. We have also requested Member States and the European Commission to prepare comprehensive national impact assessments when spectrum conditions are changed to ensure that the costs to prevent interference between the various services are balanced. 
United Kingdom
In the U.K., the Regulatory Framework is implemented through (1) the Communications Act 2003, which regulates all forms of communications technology, whether used for telecommunications or broadcasting, and (2) the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006, which regulates radio communications in the U.K. (including spectrum, licensing arrangements, usage conditions and charges, license bidding and trading and enforcement and penalties). In addition, the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, as amended, implemented E.U. Directive 2002/58, which regulates the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector. 
Telecommunications companies in the U.K., including Virgin Media, are also subject to regulation under the U.K. Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 and other U.K. statutes and subordinate legislation, including the Competition Act 1998, the Enterprise Act 2002 and the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013. The U.K. Office of Communications (Ofcom) regulates both linear and on-demand programming, with regulatory requirements derived from the AVMS.
Ofcom is the key regulatory authority for the communications sector in which Virgin Media operates in the U.K. It is responsible for furthering the interests of citizens in relation to communications matters and furthering the interests of consumers in relevant markets where appropriate by promoting competition. From April 1, 2017, Ofcom also assumed the responsibilities of regulating the BBC, a role previously undertaken by the BBC Trust. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority has jurisdiction with respect to competition matters. 
Broadband Expansion. At the end of 2017, super-fast broadband was available to almost 95% of the U.K. population. The U.K. government plans to reach 98% of the population by 2020. To stimulate private investment in this endeavor, the U.K. government is using money from the publicly funded BBC license fee, under-spend from the Analogue TV Switch-Off Project and other sources of public investment. The state aid measure permitting this subsidy was renewed (and amended) in 2016 and is expected, through amendments to its “underspend” provisions, to result in up to an additional 1% to 2% super-fast coverage. 
The U.K. government supports the market rollout of full fiber and 5G services. Such support includes public funding for the creation of a match-funded “full fiber deployment” fund, business rate relief for the deployment of new full fiber networks and public funding for a strategic program of full fiber and 5G trials. As a result, the U.K. government’s November 2017 budget includes £190.0 million ($257.0 million) for the first and second phases of its local full fiber deployment fund and £160.0 million ($216.4 million) for the first phase of the 5G trials. The Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill, which establishes the funding for these objectives. is expected to receive Royal Assent in early 2018. This will give effect to the U.K. government’s plans to provide full business rate relief for new fiber infrastructure built for the 2017-2022 rating period. Secondary legislation is expected to follow, which will define what network assets are in scope. The U.K. government also announced in November 2017, a Telecoms Market Review to explore whether the conditions for investment in fiber are optimal in the U.K. and what policy changes it should consider to encourage greater investment in new digital infrastructure. The results of the review are expected in mid-2018. 
I-30

In November 2015, the U.K. government announced that everyone will, by 2020, have a legal right to request a broadband connection of at least 10 Mbps regardless of where they live. The government intends to achieve this by introducing a broadband Universal Service Obligation (USO). The USO is aimed, in particular, at addressing the final 5% of the population in the U.K. without access to a broadband connection of a reasonable speed. The U.K. government introduced legislation in July 2017, to facilitate the introduction of a broadband USO in conjunction with the effect of the relevant provisions of the Digital Economy Act 2017. At the same time, BT made an alternative offer to invest approximately £600.0 million ($811.5 million) to provide ubiquitous minimum broadband speeds of 10 Mbps by 2022. The U.K. government formally rejected BT’s proposal in December 2017, favoring the imposition of a regulated USO. The U.K. government is expected to set out the design for the USO in secondary legislation in early 2018, with Ofcom’s implementation expected to take two years from that point. 
Television and VoD Services. In the U.K., Virgin Media is required to hold individual licenses under the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 for any television channels (including barker channels and any electronic programme guides), which Virgin Media owns or operates and for the provision of certain other services on its cable television platform, such as electronic program guides. These television licensable content service (TLCS) licenses are granted and administered by Ofcom. Under these licenses, each covered service must comply with a number of Ofcom codes, including the Broadcasting Code, and with all directions issued by Ofcom. Breach of any of the terms of a TLCS license may result in the imposition of fines on the license holder and, ultimately, the license being revoked.
As a provider of an on-demand program service (ODPS), Virgin Media must comply with a number of statutory obligations in relation to “editorial content” and notify Ofcom of its intention to provide an ODPS. Failure to notify Ofcom or comply with the relevant statutory obligations may result in the imposition of fines or, ultimately, the prohibition on providing an ODPS.
Strategic Review of Digital Communications. In March 2015, Ofcom launched a strategic review of U.K. digital communications. A discussion document was published in July 2015, inviting stakeholder comment and input. Key focus areas of Ofcom were: investment and innovation, delivering widespread availability of services; sustainable competition; empowering consumers; and, targeted regulation where necessary and deregulation elsewhere. Virgin Media responded to the discussion document emphasizing the importance of investment for competition, innovation and consumer interest. A key area of consideration was the future regulatory treatment of BT, in particular whether BT should be fully (structurally) separated, with the Openreach network division becoming a separate, independent company. Openreach is the operator of the backbone of Britain’s broadband internet network.
An “emerging thinking” document was published on February 25, 2016, setting out conclusions and Ofcom’s proposed policy position relating to a number of aspects of the U.K. regulatory regime. Key conclusions included: no structural separation of BT at the present time; an intention to improve quality of service across all providers; a requirement for BT to enhance its wholesale duct and pole access product; and an intention to advance further consumer protection measures. These will be implemented through forthcoming market reviews and other specific activity. 
On November 29, 2016, Ofcom issued an update on its plans to reform Openreach, stating that it intended to proceed with a formal notification to the European Commission to require the legal separation of Openreach from BT. In March 2017, Ofcom announced that it had reached a voluntary agreement with BT for the legal separation of Openreach. This means that Openreach will become a distinct company with its own staff and management, together with its own strategy and budget and a legal purpose to serve all of its customers equally. Assets will be controlled by Openreach, including the physical access network. Under the terms of the voluntary agreement, Openreach will be obliged to consult formally with customers, such as Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone on large-scale investments. As a result of reaching a voluntary agreement, Ofcom will no longer need to impose these changes through regulation or seek the approval of the European Commission. To reach the agreement, the existing Crown Guarantee has been maintained in respect of the BT pension scheme. In addition, Ofcom released BT from its previous undertakings once its new commitments are fully in place and setting out how compliance with the new arrangements will be measured.
Regulation of Broadband Markets. In 2017, Ofcom commenced its next triennial review of the Fixed Access markets, including the Wholesale Local Access market (incorporating physical or passive network access via methods such as LLU and duct access) and the Wholesale Broadband Access market (virtual or active network access via methods such as provision of wholesale managed service products). A key area of focus is the regulation of BT’s FTTx based wholesale products (specifically the pricing thereof) and improving the existing physical infrastructure access (allowing third parties access to BT’s duct and pole estate). This followed Ofcom’s issuance on December 6, 2016, of a consultation on making the physical infrastructure access remedy more effective. Ofcom is expected to publish its final statement on its Fixed Access markets review in early 2018, with new measures taking effect on April 1, 2018
Ofcom Review of Business Connectivity Markets. Ofcom concluded its latest review of the U.K. business connectivity markets (leased lines and dedicated business connections, among others) in the spring of 2016. Ofcom found BT held Significant Market Power in certain markets and proposed consequential regulatory remedies. These remedies included an obligation on BT to provide 
I-31

access to its dark fiber. BT, CityFibre and TalkTalk appealed Ofcom’s decision, with Virgin Media intervening. In July 2017, the Competition Appeal Tribunal found against Ofcom on all grounds and remitted the matter back to Ofcom for reconsideration. In response, Ofcom published the following on November 23, 2017: (1) a statement introducing a new market for business circuits at 1 Gbps and below, with "standard" remedies (including charge controls) imposed on BT; and (2) a consultation on the introduction of a dark fiber remedy in this new market. Ofcom’s consultation period closed on December 29, 2017, and a statement by Ofcom is expected early in 2018. 
Mobile Service. As an MVNO, Virgin Media is subject to E.U. regulations relating to retail prices for roaming services. These regulations: set limits on certain wholesale and retail tariffs for international mobile voice roaming, SMS tariffs and data roaming within the E.U.; provide for greater levels of transparency of retail pricing information; impose measures to guard against bill shock in respect of data roaming; and set maximum roaming rates within the E.U. Effective June 2017, the E.U. abolished roaming tariffs.
Mobile termination charges applied by mobile network operators are regulated by Ofcom under a Significant Market Power charge control condition. Under Virgin Media’s MVNO agreement, these changes in mobile termination charges are passed on to Virgin Media. Ofcom has set mobile termination charges for the period of 2015-2018, with rates reducing to approximately half of their starting levels by the end of this period. As a result, Virgin Media has experienced a reduction in revenue from such charges, although with some off-setting reductions in cost.
Fixed voice termination. Virgin Media has been designated as a provider with Significant Market Power on fixed voice termination. As a result, the rates it charges other providers for termination on its network are subject to regulation. This requires, among other things, the provision of termination on fair and reasonable terms, conditions and charges, which must be no higher than BT’s regulated charges, unless certain conditions are met. Ofcom commenced a review of mobile termination charges in June 2017 and has proposed that, in the U.K., mobile call termination remain regulated, with the majority of providers subject to at least some obligations. Ofcom is expected to publish its final statement in the first quarter of 2018.
Germany
Germany has incorporated the E.U. laws into national laws, although under the German legal system competency is split between the Federal State (telecommunication law) and the German federal states (Bundesländer) (media law). The German Telecommunications Act broadly implemented the Regulatory Framework and covers the distribution of any signal by telecommunications networks encompassing television signals, internet data and telephony. The German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) is responsible inter alia for the regulation of the German telecommunications market. The Federal Cartel Office (the FCO), the national competition authority (Bundeskartellamt), plays an important role with respect to infrastructure and media regulation. The FCO has powers to address competition issues in all markets, although in some cases, competition issues will be addressed by the German Federal Network Agency. 
Regulation of the media falls within the authority of the German federal states (Bundesländer). The media laws of all 16 federal states have been partially harmonized by the State Broadcasting Treaty (Rundfunkstaatsvertrag). The State Broadcasting Treaty establishes the main framework of the German regulation of broadcast. Nearly every German state has established its own independent regulatory body, the state media authority (Landesmedienanstalt) for the regulation of the private broadcasting sector. The state media authorities are primarily responsible for licensing and supervision of commercial broadcasters and the allocation of transmission capacities for radio and television channels. They also have authority with respect to the regulation of channel carriage fees, conditional access systems, interfaces, electronic programming guides, the bundling of programs and price regulation. 
The allocation and use of analog cable transmission capacities for both radio and television channels in Germany is governed by the must carry rules of the respective German federal states. The allocation of digital transmission capacities for digital television and radio channels is primarily governed by the must carry rules of the State Broadcasting Treaty. Unitymedia has ceased the distribution of analog television channels in June 2017, but still continues to carry analog radio channels. Therefore, the media law in the states of Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, where Unitymedia operates, requires Unitymedia to carry several analog radio channels, until Unitymedia decides to cease distribution of analog radio channels. 
The operation of conditional access systems for television services is governed by both the State Broadcasting Treaty and the German Telecommunications Act. Generally, operators must not unfairly obstruct or discriminate against broadcasters and other content providers through conditional access systems. 
Unitymedia has been declared an operator with Significant Market Power on the market for call termination on an individual fixed public telephone network.  Since November 2013, reciprocal termination rates for exchanging calls via Unitymedia’s IP-interface have been imposed, which results in Unitymedia, like every other telecommunications provider in Germany, charging the interconnection rate of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom, when receiving traffic via the IP-
I-32

interface. The level of termination rates applicable to Unitymedia with respect to calls terminating on its IP-interface is currently set at €0.1 cents/minute, which rate will expire on December 31, 2018.
Belgium 
Belgium has broadly transposed the Regulatory Framework into law. According to the electronic communications law of June 13, 2005, the Belgisch Instituut voor Post en Telecommunicate (the BIPT), the Belgian NRA, should perform a market analysis to determine which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In addition, the Federal Parliament prepared legislation to transpose the 2009 revisions to the Regulatory Framework, which became effective as of August 4, 2012. 
Telenet has been declared an operator with Significant Market Power on the market for call termination on an individual fixed public telephone network. Since April 1, 2012, reciprocal termination rates have been imposed, which results in Telenet charging the interconnection rate of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Proximus. Following a court annulment of a final decision on wholesale tariffs issued by BIPT in 2016, BIPT issued a new draft decision in 2017 that proposes a wholesale tariff of €0.103 cents per minute, subject to public comment.
Although no determination has been made on whether Telenet, as an MVNO, has Significant Market Power on the market for call termination on individual mobile networks, its rates have been affected by rate limitations implemented by BIPT. As of January 1, 2013, mobile termination rates have been set by BIPT at €1.08 cents per minute, and to date, 2015 rates have not been set. In May 2017, BIPT published its latest decision on the relevant market for “call termination on individual mobile networks”. Telenet, as an mobile network operator, has also been designated in the draft decision as having Significant Market Power by BIPT. In the draft decision, BIPT adopts a bottom-up long run incremental cost model to calculate tariffs for call termination on individual mobile networks, resulting in a nominal value of €0.99 cents per minute as of July 1, 2017.
In 2011, BIPT and the regional regulators for the media sectors (together, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities) found Telenet to have significant market power in the broadcasting market (the 2011 Decision). The 2011 Decision imposed on Telenet an obligation to provide third-party operators, at specified tariff rates, with (1) a resale offer of an analog television package, (2) access to digital television platforms and (3) a resale offer of broadband internet access in combination with the digital television access obligation. We refer to the tariff portion of the 2011 Decision as the “Retail Minus Rules”. On November 12, 2014, the 2011 Decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Appeal also accepted Proximus’ claim that Proximus should be allowed access the digital television platforms of other operators, including Telenet, for the purpose of reselling bundles of digital video and broadband internet services. On November 30, 2015, Telenet filed an appeal of the Court of Appeal’s ruling with the Belgian Supreme Court. As required by the 2011 Decision, Telenet has implemented the access obligations at the rates specified by the Retail Minus Rules, and on March 1, 2016, Orange Belgium launched a commercial offer combining a cable TV package with broadband internet access for certain of their mobile customers. On October 2, 2017, in a separate action, the Court of Appeal annulled the Retail Minus Rules, but maintained the effects of the Retail Minus Rules until April 30, 2018. Accordingly, as of May 1, 2018, the tariff rates for Telenet’s resale obligations will be unregulated until a new decision from the  Belgium Regulatory Authorities is adopted. 
On July 7, 2017, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities published a draft market review decision (the 2017 Draft Decision) that, once adopted, will replace the 2011 Decision. The 2017 Draft Decision proposed a finding of significant market power of Telenet in the wholesale broadband market. Proposed obligations include (1) providing third-party operators with access to the digital television platform (including basic digital video and analog video) and (2) making available to third-party operators a bitstream offer of broadband internet access (including fixed voice as an option). The 2017 Draft Decision is expected to be submitted to the European Commission in the first quarter of 2018. Telenet considers the 2017 Draft Decision to be inconsistent with the principle of technology-neutral regulation and the European Single Market Strategy to stimulate further investments in broadband networks.
The 2011 Decision and the 2017 Draft Decision aim to, and in their application, may strengthen Telenet’s competitors by granting them resale access to Telenet’s network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding Telenet’s substantial historical financial outlays in developing the infrastructure. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (1) limit the bandwidth available to Telenet to provide new or expanded products and services to the customers served by its network and (2) adversely impact Telenet’s ability to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on the extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access afforded to Telenet’s network, the rates that Telenet receives for such access and other competitive factors or market developments.
Switzerland
Switzerland has a regulatory system that partially reflects the principles of the E.U., but otherwise is distinct from the European regulatory system of telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act (Fernmeldegesetz) regulates, in general, the transmission 
I-33

of information, including the transmission of radio and television signals. Most aspects of the distribution of radio and television, however, are regulated under the Radio and Television Act (Bundesgesetz über Radio und Fernsehen). In addition, the Competition Act, the Data Protection Act and the Act on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications are potentially relevant to our business. With respect to energy consumption of electronic home devices, the Energy Act and the Energy Ordinance are applicable to set-top boxes. 
Under the Telecommunications Act, any provider of telecommunication services needs to register with the Federal Office of Communications. Dominant providers have to grant access to third parties, including LLU access; however, it is restricted to the copper wire network of the incumbent, Swisscom. Therefore, such unbundling obligations do not apply to our business in Switzerland and other cable operators. Also, any dominant provider has to grant access to its ducts, subject to sufficient capacity being available in the relevant duct. At this time, only Swisscom has been determined to be dominant in this regard. Dominant operators are obliged to provide interconnection and all providers of services forming part of the universal service in Switzerland have to ensure interoperability of services.
In regards to call termination as part of interconnection agreements, Swisscom as market dominant provider, must offer these services at cost-oriented prices and disclose the conditions and prices for their individual access services. In interconnection agreements with Swisscom, reciprocal termination rates are imposed. 
In September 2017, a draft of the revised Telecommunications Act was published by the Federal Council. They plan to introduce measures to allow for easier access to the incumbent’s network, better consumer and youth protection measures (such as decreasing roaming fees, measures to prevent spoofing) and a change to the regulatory regime giving the Federal Communications Commission partial ex officio rights to impose obligations on market dominant providers. In terms of net neutrality, the draft foresees more transparency for the customer—he/she must be informed of traffic if treated unequally. The proposal is now subject to parliamentary debates and will not be legally binding prior to 2020. 
Under the Radio and Television Act and the corresponding ordinance, cable network operators are obliged to distribute certain programs that contribute in a particular manner to media diversity. The Federal Government and the Federal Office of Communications can select up to 25 programs that have to be distributed without the cable operator being entitled to compensation. 
Public Service broadcasters in Switzerland (SRG and regional channels) are currently funded through both public funds (TV license fee called BILLAG) and commercial advertising revenue. This model is currently being challenged by a group that started an initiative to abolish the license fee. In March 2018, the Swiss population will vote on this matter. If the initiative gets accepted, this would change the Swiss TV landscape significantly.
In September 2016, the Intelligence Agencies Act was approved by the Swiss population and became effective in September 2017. For Telecommunications service providers, the Intelligence Agencies Act set forth new obligations regulating cable traffic. 
The revised version of the Data Protection Act foresees more transparency regarding the processing of data. One example is by reinforcing the information duties when processing personal data. Furthermore, the new version follows the developments in the E.U. This revised version was subject to public consultation until April 2017. The Federal Council published the draft in September 2017. It is now up for discussion in parliament. 
The Netherlands
The Netherlands’ electronic communications law broadly implements the Regulatory Framework. Pursuant to the electronic communications law, the Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM), the Netherlands NRA, performed a market analysis to determine which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In December 2011, ACM completed its analysis of the television market and concluded that there were no grounds for regulation of that market. As a result, no new regulations relating to the television market may be proposed without a new analysis. Similar to our other operations, VodafoneZiggo JV is subject to must carry obligations, including a number of regional and local broadcasting channels, as well as public broadcasting channels. 
On August 5, 2013, ACM published a market analysis decision on call termination, which combines both the fixed termination market and the mobile termination market. Following various administrative actions, which resulted in the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court upholding the ACM decision in July 2017, a new ACM market analysis decision on call termination became effective for the period 2017-2019. The new decision has been appealed by various operators, including Ziggo, with a hearing scheduled for March 22, 2018.
In July 2015, the Dutch incumbent telecommunications operator KPN filed an appeal against the European Commission regarding its decision to approve the acquisition of Ziggo, which we completed in November 2014. In October 2017, the court, 
I-34

upheld the appeal; thereby annulling the European Commission’s clearance of the Ziggo acquisition. We are currently in the process of re-notifying this merger and expect to finish this process in 2018. The annulment of the European Commission’s decision does not have any effect on the VodafoneZiggo JV transaction and there is no impact on the day-to-day operations of the VodafoneZiggo JV.
On October 31, 2014, ACM published a draft of market analysis decision on LLU, which became final with certain revisions in December 2015. ACM concluded that KPN is dominant on the wholesale LLU market and imposed obligations on KPN. ACM concluded that Ziggo is not part of the relevant wholesale market. As a result, ACM imposed obligations on KPN only. ACM has indicated that as a result of the formation of the VodafoneZiggo JV, it started working on a new analysis of the LLU market. ACM intends to publish a draft decision for national consultation in the first quarter of 2018.
