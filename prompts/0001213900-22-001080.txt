ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organizational History



We were formed in Delaware on June 26, 1972 as OCR Corporation, underwent a series of name changes and businesses and on April 25, 2008 changed our name to Texas Wyoming Drilling, Inc. On January 26, 2016, we entered into an Equity Exchange Agreement (the “EEA”) whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Drone USA, LLC in exchange for 440,425 shares of our common stock and 250 shares of Series A preferred stock, subsequent and pursuant to our completing a 1-for-150 share reverse stock split on all issued and outstanding common stock which resulted in total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of 6,368 immediately prior to this issuance. In connection with the EEA, 1,253 shares of common stock were relinquished and an additional 44,043 shares of common stock were issued pursuant to a previous settlement agreement. In connection with the EEA, effective January 26, 2016, we accepted the resignation of Margaret Cadena, the former Chief Executive Officer and Board member, and Richard Kugelman, Dr. Robert Michet, and Dr. David Durkin, the remaining former officers and Board members, and appointed Michael Bannon as Chief Executive Officer, President, Chairman and Board member and the former Chief Financial Officer of Drone USA, LLC, as Secretary, Treasurer, and Board member. Our former CFO resigned as our CFO and as a member of our Board on July 10, 2017 and Michael Bannon was appointed as CFO. On May 19, 2016, we changed our name to Drone USA, Inc., we changed our ticker symbol to DRUS, and we completed a 1-for-12 share reverse stock split on all issued and outstanding common stock, with a record date of May 24, 2016, which resulted in total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of 40,842 on June 17, 2016 when all round lot issuances were completed. The company notified shareholders May 30, 2018 that it intended to increase the authorized shares from 200,000 to 1,500,000 and change the name to Bantek Inc. On February 24,, 2019, the company notified the shareholders that intended to increase the authorized shares from 1,500,000,000 to 6,000,000,000 shares. Bantek, Inc. filed a change of name to Bantec, Inc. and to effect a reverse stock split (of the common stock) of 1 for 1,000 on September 16, 2019, which became effective on February 10, 2020. All share and per share data have been retrospectively adjusted for the effects of all reverse splits.



We are currently traded on the OTC Pink market under the symbol BANT.



On June 1, 2016, we entered into an agreement with BRVANT Technologic Solutions (“BRVANT”), a company in Brazil that develops and manufactures UAV systems, embedded systems and simulators for commercial and military customers. We acquired exclusive rights to BRVANT’s UAV technology and intellectual property relating to its UAV technology. As consideration for the agreement, Dr. Rodrigo Kuntz Rangel, BRVANT’s CEO, was appointed to the position of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and issued a stock option grant for 2,000 shares of common stock in Drone USA. We have the option to acquire ownership of all outstanding capital stock of BRVANT for additional consideration of $1 million, but we have not made a decision to make that purchase at this time.



On September 9, 2016, Howco Distributing Co., (“Howco”) became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bantec, Inc. We acquired all of its issued and outstanding shares held by Paul Charles (“Chuck”) Joy and Kathryn B. Joy, the founders and officers of Howco, for $3,500,000, a warrant for 500 shares of Bantec, Inc. common stock with an exercise price of $10.00 per share, and earnout consideration, the funds for which were received from the TCA loan discussed below. We paid $2,600,000 in cash and issued a note to the sellers for $900,000. Howco is a supplier of spare and replacement parts to the United States Federal Government and commercial customers worldwide with expertise in Defense Logistics Agency, TACOM, NECO and other Department of Defense acquisition groups. Howco understands the entire contract and administration management process for Federal Government contracts and supply chain logistics for its Federal Government customers as well as prime contractors with Federal Government contracts. Prior to the acquisition, Howco reported revenues of approximately $18.78 million and $24.86 million, and net income of approximately $903,000 and $1,013,000, for the period from October 1, 2015 through September 9, 2016 and the year ended September 30, 2015, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2021, two customers accounted for approximately 57%, and 23% of Howco’s total sales. Howco’s dependence on two significant customers, is a risk for its ability to maintain or increase its future revenues since the loss of one or both could have significant adverse financial consequences for Howco and Bantec, Inc.

On November 15, 2017, we executed a Liability Purchase arrangement with Livingston Asset Management (“Livingston”) under which Livingston agreed to purchase up to $10,000,000 that we owe to our creditors through direct purchase of the debts from our creditors in return for (i) a convertible note issued by the Company in the principal amount of $50,000 bearing interest of 10% per year to cover certain legal fees and other expenses that matures in six months and is convertible into shares of our common stock at a 30% reduction off the lowest closing bid price for 20 trading days prior to the date of conversion, (ii) a convertible note subject to these same terms as the convertible note issued to Livingston, payable to Scottsdale Capital Advisors in the principal amount of $15,000 as a placement agent fee and (iii) the right of Livingston to retain 30% of any negotiated reduction off the face amount of the liability we owe to such creditors. Following a court judgment (March 2018) for the liabilities purchased by Livingston, we have been issuing free trading shares of our common stock under section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act to Livingston in the amount of such judgment in a series of tranches so that Livingston will not own more than 9.99% of our outstanding shares per tranche.



The Impact of COVID-19



The Company is a wholesale vendor to the Department of Defense through its wholly owned subsidiary, Howco and is directly involved in distribution of advanced low altitude UAV systems, services and products. Both the wholesale vendor and the distribution aspects of the Company’s business have been affected due to the COVID-19 social distancing requirements mandated by the federal, state and local governments where the Company’s operations occur. For some businesses, like the Company’s, much of the distribution of its core products and delivery of its core services cannot always be done through “virtual” means, and even when this is possible, it requires significant capital and time to achieve. During the year ended September 30, 2021 sales and shipments at Howco have continued at a lower rate than during the year ended September 30, 2020. It is anticipated that there may be a higher impact of the COVID-19 being realized during the year ended September 30, 2022, however the Company cannot assess the financial impact of the related COVID-19 restrictions as compared to other economic and business factors.
Growth Strategy



Our parent company intends to focus on raising capital to fund our expansion into the distribution, manufacturing, sanitizing and construction industries. Although, we will continually look to grow organically, through franchise creation and through acquisitions. We are looking for companies that will ultimately complement each other where we can cross sell our customers a wide variety of goods and services. For example, we are looking to purchase a distributor or manufacturer that will enable us to sell new products to the US government through our subsidiary Howco.
Drone Sales



Through our Drone USA website (droneusainc.com) and through limited direct selling efforts we offer police, fire, the US government drone programs. Our drone programs constitute selling our customers drones, drone accessories, accident reconstruction software, drone training, drone services, counter-drone technology, certificates of authorization (COAs) and Waivers.
Acquisitions



We are looking to acquire companies in industries where we possess experience. For example, we would like to acquire companies in the construction, environmental, manufacturing and distribution industries. When acquired, we will initially run the companies as independent entities keeping their identities temporarily intact. When we are confident that we fully know the business and their customers, we will begin to bring them into the Bantec family changing their names to a Bantec division such as Bantec Air, Bantec Arms or Bantec Electrical. In the future, we may to look to franchise some of our divisions. This will make up our primary growth path. These are our intended divisions:

1. | Bantec Construction
---+--------------------


2. | Bantec Air (Heating & Cooling)
---+-------------------------------


3. | Bantec Electrical
---+------------------


4. | Bantec Distribution
---+--------------------


5. | Bantec Manufacturing
---+---------------------

Bantec Sanitizing



Through Bantec Sanitizing (a division of Bantec), through our franchising efforts, we sell disinfecting products and equipment to facility owners in hospitals, universities, manufacturers and building owners. We sell sanitizing products through our website at Bantec.store.

Howco’s Business



Howco is a premier supplier of spare and replacement parts to a wide variety of Federal Government agencies, U.S. military prime contractors and commercial customers worldwide. Founded in 1990 and located in Vancouver, Washington, Howco’s services encompass bid solicitation, contract management, packaging and logistics for construction, transportation, mining and heavy equipment spare and replacement parts to customers worldwide utilizing a wide variety of supply chain solutions. Howco was the winner of the 2012 United States’ Department of Defense Logistics Agency’s Bronze Supplier Award. Howco reported revenues of approximately $2.4 million and $4.5 million, and net (loss) of approximately ($163,000) and ($166,000), for the year ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.
Howco’s Government Services Contracts



Howco enters into various types of contracts with our customers, such as Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Completion, Cost-reimbursement (CR), Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Fixed-Price Incentive (FPI) and Time-and-Materials (T&M). The majority of Howco’s revenues are derived from FFP contracts.



IDIQ contracts provide for an indefinite quantity of services or stated limits of supplies for a fixed period. They are used when the customer cannot determine, above a specified minimum, the precise quantities of supplies or services that the government will require during the contract period. IDIQs help streamline the contract process and speed service delivery. IDIQ contracts are most often used for service contracts and architect-engineering services. Awards are usually for base years and option years. The customer places delivery orders (for supplies) or task orders (for services) against a basic contract for individual requirements. Minimum and maximum quantity limits are specified in the basic contract as either a number of units (for supplies) or as dollar values (for services).



CPFF LOE contracts will be issued when the scope of work is defined in general terms requiring only that the contractor devote a specified LOE for a stated time period. A CPFF completion contract will be issued when the scope of work defines a definite goal or target which leads to an end product deliverable (e.g., a final report of research accomplishing the goal or target).



CR contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. These contracts establish an estimate of total cost for the purpose of obligating funds and establishing a ceiling that the contractor may not exceed (except at its own risk) without the approval of the contracting officer and are suitable for use only when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.



FFP contract will be issued when acquiring supplies or services on the basis of definite or detailed specifications and fair and reasonable prices can be established at the outset.



FPI target delivery contract will be issued when acquiring supplies or services on the basis of reasonably definite or detailed specifications and cost can be reasonably predicted at the outset wherein the cost risk will be shared. A firm target cost, target profit, and profit adjustment formula will be negotiated to provide a fair and reasonable incentive and a ceiling that provides for the contractor to assume an appropriate share of the risk.



T&M contracts provide for acquiring supplies or services on the basis of (i) direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit; and (ii) actual cost for materials. A customer may use this contract when it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.



Market Size



According to published reports one-third of the DoD budget request, $247.4 billion, is for procurement and research, development, test, and evaluation (“RDT&E”) in 2020. The U.S. Government spends a portion of this budget on the shipping of replacement parts annually.
Intellectual Property



We review each of our intellectual properties and make a determination as to the best means to protect such property, by trademark, by copyright, by patent, by trade secret, or otherwise. We believe that we have taken appropriate steps to protect our intellectual properties, based on our evaluation of the factors unique to each such property, but cannot guarantee that this is the case.

Regulatory Matters



The use of unmanned aerial vehicles for commercial purposes is governed by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”). On August 29, 2016, the new FAA rules took effect for commercial use of small drones. Under the FAA rules commercial drones must be under 55 pounds and be registered with the FAA. The rules require a new “remote pilot certificate”, daylight-only operations 30 minutes before official sunrise and 30 minutes after official sunset, a requirement that all flights travel at a maximum groundspeed of 100 miles per hour remain, below 400 feet or within 400 feet of a structure and yield the right of way to other aircraft. Under the FAA rules, drone pilots must be at least 16 years old or be supervised by an adult with a remote pilot certificate. The pilot must also maintain “visual line of sight” with the drone at all times, among other requirements. The new rules also require that any drone-related incident that results in at least $500 worth of damage or causes serious injury be reported to the FAA within 10 days. The new restrictions can be waived, but pilots will need to apply directly to the FAA for an exemption and/or a waiver.
Competition



Drone USA LLC



The competition for Drone USA consists mainly of resellers of drones who sell to law enforcement, fire departments security companies and the U.S. government. These competitors primarily are Amazon, Best Buy, Drone Nerds, SYNNEX and other distributors of drones. On the training front our competitors consist of SMG and other training suppliers.
Howco



The business of supplying spare and replacement parts to Federal Government agencies, U.S. military prime contractors and commercial customers is very competitive. Among our U.S. based competitors are JGILS that supplies parts manufactured by Fairbanks Morse/Coltec and other brands, Ohio Cat that supplies Caterpillar parts, and Kampi Components and Brighton Cromwell, both of which compete with us in several brands. 
Bantec Construction & Environmental



In the construction & environmental industries located in the tristate area there is a tremendous amount of competition. In all three states, we will encounter competition from both small and large contractors, and from union and non-union contractors.
Employees



We have six full-time employees, one with Bantec and five are with Howco, and two part-time employees with Howco. We have no labor union contracts and believe relations with our employees are satisfactory.
Emerging Growth Company



We are and we will remain an “emerging growth company” as defined under The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a “large accelerated filer” (with at least $700 million in public float) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

As an “emerging growth company”, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:




● | only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” disclosure;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | no requirement that we hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We have taken advantage of some of these reduced burdens, and thus the information we provide stockholders may be different from what you might receive from other public companies in which you hold shares.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.



Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a “smaller reporting company”, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a “smaller reporting company”, at such time as we cease being an “emerging growth company”, the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an “emerging growth company” or a “smaller reporting company”. Specifically, similar to “emerging growth companies”, “smaller reporting companies” are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”) requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports.
