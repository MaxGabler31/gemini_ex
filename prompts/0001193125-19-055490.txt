 On October 1, 2018, we completed the previously announced sale of all the assets, including intellectual property, used primarily in our Riverside clinical and standardized testing business (Riverside Business). 
Market Overview 
 HMH operates predominantly within the U.S. K-12 Education market, which represents over $600 billion of total spending annually, and specifically within the U.S. market for K-12 instructional materials and services, which we estimate to be approximately $11.0 billion in size. Internationally, we export and sell K-12 English language education products to premium private schools that utilize the U.S. curriculum, located primarily in Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. We also participate in the U.S. Trade publishing market, which is estimated to be approximately $16.0 billion according to the Association of American Publishers. 
 The U.S. Education market comprises approximately 13,600 K-12 public school districts, 132,900 public and private schools, 3.7 million teachers and 56.6 million total student enrollment across public, private and charter schools. From Fall 2016 to Fall 2026, total elementary and secondary school enrollment, a major long-term driver of growth in the K-12 Education market, is projected to increase by 2% to 56.8 million students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

The primary sources of funding for public schools in the U.S. are state and local tax collections, with Federal funding accounting for approximately 9% of public education spending nationally. Consequently, general or localized economic conditions as well as legislative and political decisions which affect the ability of state and school districts to raise revenue through tax collections can have a significant impact on spending and growth in the K-12 Education market. Public K-12 education has been, and remains, a high priority for political leaders, accounting for more than one-fifth of all state and local government spending. 
 Education policy and curriculum choices have traditionally been local prerogatives in the U.S., but Federal law and policy also play an important role. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, reauthorized in 2015 by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), requires that states, as a condition to receiving Federal education funds, adopt challenging academic content standards, administer annual student tests aligned to those standards, develop systems of accountability tied to specific goals for student achievement, and take measures to identify and support low performing schools. ESSA gives states more flexibility than they had under prior law, but still requires standards-based, largely assessment-driven accountability with a focus on the achievement of students in all demographic subgroups. 
 One important change brought about by ESSA is that states are now permitted to use growth in student achievement as measured by statewide assessments, in addition to grade-level proficiency, as an academic indicator for purposes of accountability. Instructional solutions that incorporate interim assessments and data analytics to help monitor student performance in real time can be especially useful in states that incorporate student growth as a significant element of their accountability systems. Other changes brought about by ESSA include a greater emphasis on English language learners, with progress towards English proficiency now a required element of state accountability plans, a requirement that products and solutions paid for with Federal education funds have evidence of effectiveness, and new requirements and expectations for Federally funded educator professional learning programs. The new law also gives states and school districts greater flexibility in how they spend Federal dollars and how they demonstrate that Federal funds are used to supplement and not supplant state and local spending. 
 Title I, the largest program within ESSA, and other ESSA programs also provide targeted funding for specific activities, such as early childhood education, school improvement, dropout prevention, and before- and after-school programs. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to children with disabilities. In addition, school districts in many states are now able to spend educational funds on instructional materials that include core and supplemental materials, computer software, digital media, digital courseware, and online services. 
 Academic content standards, which are grade-level expectations for student learning, are established at the state level. States generally review and revise standards in each of the various subject areas every six to eight years, and the revision or adoption of new standards typically gives rise to the need for new instructional materials and services aligned to the new or revised standards. A large percentage of states have adopted the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in English language arts and mathematics or standards largely based on the Common Core, and, as of December 2018, nineteen states had adopted Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Both the CCSS and NGSS are products of state-led collaborations. The adoption of these standards has led to greater uniformity among states, but has not completely eliminated differences or the need for customized state-specific instructional materials. 
 Market Segments 
 Core Curriculum 
 In the U.S., K-12 core curriculum programs provides educational content and assessments to over 56.6 million students across approximately 132,900 public and private elementary and secondary schools. Core 
 
5 
 
 programs cover curriculum standards in a particular subject and include a comprehensive offering of teacher and student materials necessary to conduct the class throughout the year. Products and services include students print and digital offerings and a variety of supporting materials such as teachers editions, formative assessments, supplemental materials, whole group instruction materials, practice aids, educational games and services. 
 Core curriculum programs traditionally have been the primary resource for classroom instruction in most K-12 academic subjects, and as a result, enrollment trends are a major driver of industry growth. Although economic cycles may affect short-term buying patterns, school enrollments, a driver of growth in the educational content industry, are highly predictable and are expected to trend upward over the longer term. 
 Demand for core curriculum programs is also affected by changes in state curriculum standards, which drive instruction, assessment, and accountability in each state. A significant change in state curriculum standards requires that assessments, teacher training programs, and instructional materials be revised or replaced to align to the new standards, which historically has driven demand for new comprehensive curriculum programs. 
 In the U.S., core instructional material programs are typically selected and purchased at the school district level and, in some cases, at the individual school level. In nineteen states, before districts make their selections, programs are first evaluated at the state level for alignment to state academic standards and other criteria. These states are commonly referred to as adoption states, while states that do not have a state level review process are called open states or open territory. In some adoption states, districts are required to select materials from the state-adopted list; in others the state list is just a recommendation, and districts are free to purchase and use whatever materials they choose, whether or not adopted by the state. Adoption states typically review materials in the various subject areas on a six- to eight-year cycle. School districts in those states tend to follow the state review cycle and replace core programs in the year or years immediately following state adoption. In open states, each individual school or school district evaluates and purchases materials independently, typically according to a five- to ten-year cycle. As a result, in individual adoption states, purchases of core instructional materials in a particular subject area tend to be clustered in a window of one to three years, while in individual open territory states they may be spread over several years. 
 The following map illustrates the current adoption and open territory states: 
 


The formal determination whether to approve a program for state adoption is typically made by the state board of education or chief state school officer, informed by recommendations by one or more instructional materials review committees comprised of educators, curriculum specialists, and or subject area experts. The district level selection process varies but, in both adoption and open states, usually entails presentation to and evaluation by a committee of educators. State level evaluations typically focus primarily on alignment to state academic standards, whereas local evaluators consider, in addition to standards alignment, more subjective factors such as ease of use and suitability for particular student populations. Providers of instructional content often, although not always, customize their programs for particular states, including both adoption and open 
 
6 
 
 states, to strengthen alignment to state standards and assessments and/or to address specific needs and preferences of students and educators in a state. 
 The student population in adoption states represented approximately 48% of the U.S. public school elementary and secondary school-age population. A number of adoption states, and a few open territory states, provide categorical state funding for instructional materials; that is, funds that cannot be used for any purpose other than to purchase instructional content or, in some cases, technology equipment used to deliver instruction. In some states, categorical instructional materials funds can be used only for the purchase of materials on the state-approved list. In states that do not provide categorical state instructional materials funding, districts pay for materials primarily out of general purpose state formula aid and/or local funds. 
 Supplemental 
 Supplemental resources encompass a wide variety of targeted solutions that enrich learning and support student achievement beyond core curriculum. Supplemental resources can be print and/or digital, and can include workbooks, test-prep materials, software, games and apps. Many teachers augment their core curriculum with supplemental resources for additional practice and personalized instruction around particular areas of need, such as writing or vocabulary. Supplemental materials are purchased by individual teachers, schools and districts whose purchases are not tied to adoption schedules and who use funding from local, state and federal sources. 
Intervention 
 Intervention solutions are generally purchased by individual schools or districts. Demand for intervention materials is significant and growing in the United States. In the latest NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress) assessments conducted in 2017, more than 60 percent of public school students performed below proficiency in both literacy and mathematics. These students are strong candidates for intervention programs that are focused on improving outcomes and ensuring students perform at grade level. As demand for digital content and personalized learning solutions is growing, traditional distinctions between core, supplemental and intervention materials and assessments are blurring. 
 Intervention products and services are funded through state and local funding as well as federal funding allocations pursuant to the ESSA and IDEA. Title I provides funding to schools and school districts with high concentrations of students from low income families and is often used to purchase intervention products and services. 
 Professional Learning 
 The professional learning market segment includes consulting and support services to assist individual schools and school districts in raising student achievement, implementing new programs and technology effectively, developing effective teachers, principals and leaders, as well as school and school-district turnaround and improvement solutions. We believe all districts and schools contract for some level of professional services. These services may include support for up-front training, in-classroom coaching, institutes, author workshops, professional learning communities, leadership development, technical support and maintenance, and program management. 
 Professional learning is directly addressed in ESSA. ESSA restructured Title II, the section of the law addressing teacher quality, and eliminated federal highly qualified teacher requirements. ESSA prohibits U.S. Department of Education mandates and incentives to evaluate teachers based on student test scores, which in recent years have channeled resources and attention to the development of educator evaluation systems, measurement tools, and related training. Title II now focuses instead on the role of the profession in improving student achievement, including new requirements to ensure professional development is not only sustained (no one-day workshops), but also job-embedded, data-driven, and personalized. It is expected that school districts will 
 
7 
 
 need to focus their applications for teacher training to ensure teacher alignment with high quality standards, as well as priorities for funds to low-performing schools where comprehensive support and improvement plans are in place. There are also significant funding opportunities for professional learning as part of state programs, especially in states where they have consolidated program funding and want solutions that are evidence-based. 
 The professional learning services segment, which is relatively fragmented in the United States, is expected to grow as the transition to digital learning in classrooms increases the need for technology training and implementation support for educators. We believe that the use of interim data, differentiation, teacher content knowledge (in mathematics) and the use of technology in the classroom are the areas in which teachers and leaders are most seeking support. Also, demand for teacher training and professional development opportunities tied to the implementation of new or revised standards at the state level is expected to continue. In addition, the need for new teacher development over the next several years is expected to grow as we continue to see the greening of the teaching force, with approximately 360,000 new teachers hired every year and approximately 33% of teachers leaving within their first five years in the profession. 
 Trade Publishing 
 The Trade Publishing market includes childrens, fiction, nonfiction, culinary and reference titles. While digital formats have gained some traction in this market, print remains the primary format in which trade books are produced and distributed. In recent years, ebook sales in the industry have declined while the market overall grew.

Trade Publishing 
 Our Trade Publishing segment, founded in 1832, primarily develops, markets and sells consumer books in print and digital formats and licenses book rights to other publishers and electronic businesses in the United States and abroad. The principal distribution channels for Trade Publishing products are retail stores (both physical and online) and wholesalers. Reference materials are also sold to schools, colleges, libraries, office supply distributors and other businesses. 
 Our Trade Publishing segment offers an extensive library of general interest, young readers and reference works that include well-known characters and brands. Our award-winning general interest titles include literary fiction, culinary, and non-fiction in hardcover, ebook and paperback formats, including the Mariner Books paperback line. Among the general interest properties are the popular J.R.R. Tolkien titles, the prolific The Best American Series and major cookbook brands such as Betty Crocker and Better Homes and Gardens in addition to recent best sellers including the How to Cook Everything series and Whole30. In young readers publishing, our list addresses a broad age group and includes recognized characters and titles such as Curious George and Martha Speaks, Five Little Monkeys, Gossie & Friends, Polar Express, Little Blue Truck, and many more. We also publish novels for young adults, a growing genre, including titles from Lois Lowry, author of The Giver, and Kwame Alexander. Most recently, our Trade Publishing business launched the series Carmen Sandiego on Netflix as part of our strategy to expand our content across media platforms. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, Trade Publishing net sales and Adjusted EBITDA were approximately $199.7 million and $21.9 million, $180.6 million and $12.1 million, and $165.6 million and $6.3 million, respectively. 
 Seasonality 
 Approximately 85% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were derived from our Education segment, which is a markedly seasonal business. Schools conduct the majority of their purchases in 
 
9 
 
 the second and third quarters of the calendar year in preparation for the beginning of the school year. Thus, over our latest three completed fiscal years, approximately 67% of consolidated net sales were realized in the second and third quarters. Sales of K-12 instructional materials are also cyclical, with some years offering more sales opportunities than others. The amount of funding available at the state level for educational materials also has a significant effect on year-to-year net sales. Although the loss of a single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our business, schedules of school adoptions and market acceptance of our products can materially affect year-to-year net sales performance. 
 Competition 
 We sell our products in highly competitive markets. In these markets, product quality, innovation and customer service are major differentiating factors between companies. Other factors affecting competition include: (i) competitive pricing, sampling and gratis costs; (ii) digitization and innovative delivery; and (iii) educational effectiveness of the program. In addition to national curriculum publishers, we also compete with a variety of specialized or regional publishers that focus on select disciplines and/or geographic regions in the K-12 market. There are also multiple competitors in the Trade Publishing, supplemental and assessment segments offering content that school districts increasingly are using as part of their core classroom instructional materials. In addition, school districts in many states are able to spend educational funds on instructional materials that include core and supplemental materials, computer software, digital media, digital courseware, and online services. Our larger competitors in the educational market include Pearson Education, Inc., McGraw Hill Education, Cengage Learning, Inc., Scholastic Corporation, Curriculum Associates, LLC, Benchmark Education, LLC, Accelerate Learning, Inc., and Amplify Education, Inc. Also competing in our market as a substitute are open educational resources. These resources are free, digital solutions that range from supplemental resources to full Core Solutions programs. 
 Printing and binding; raw materials 
 We outsource the printing and binding of our products, with approximately 49% of our printing requirements handled by one major supplier. We have procurement agreements that provide volume and scheduling flexibility and price predictability. We have a longstanding relationship with these parties. Approximately 14% of our printed materials (consisting primarily of teachers editions and other ancillary components) are printed outside of the United States and approximately 86% of our printed materials (including most student editions) are printed within the United States. Paper is one of our principal raw materials. We purchase our paper primarily through one paper merchant and also directly through suppliers for limited product types. We maintain various agreements that protect against supply availability and unbound price increases. We manage our paper supply concentration by having primary and secondary sources and staying ahead of dramatic market changes. 
 Distribution 
 We operate three distribution facilities from which we coordinate our own distribution process: one each in Indianapolis, Indiana; Geneva, Illinois; and Troy, Missouri. We also utilize select suppliers to assist us with coordinating the distribution process for a limited number of product types. Additionally, some adoption states require us to use in-state textbook depositories for educational materials sold in that particular state. We utilize various delivery firms, such as United Parcel Service Inc., FedEx Freight, etc., to facilitate the principally ground transportation of products. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 3,600 employees, none of which were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These employees are substantially located in the United States with 197 employees located outside of the United States. We believe that relations with employees are generally good.

Intellectual property 
 Our principal intellectual property assets consist of our trademarks and copyrights in our content. Substantially all of our publications are protected by copyright, whether registered or unregistered, either in our name as the author of a work made for hire or the assignee of copyright, or in the name of an author who has licensed us to publish the work. Ownership of such copyrights secures the exclusive right to publish the work in the United States and in many countries abroad for specified periods: in the United States, in most cases, either 95 years from publication or for the authors life plus 70 years, but in any event a minimum of 28 years for works published prior to 1978 and 35 years for works published thereafter. In most cases, the authors who retain ownership of their copyright have licensed to us exclusive rights for the full term of copyright. Under U.S. copyright law, for licenses granted by an author during or after 1978, such exclusive licenses are subject to termination by the author or certain of the authors heirs for a five year period beginning at the end of 35 years after the date of publication of the work or 40 years after the date of the license grant, whichever term ends earlier. 
 We do not own any material patents, franchises or concessions, but we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in connection with our publishing businesses. We believe we have taken, and take in the ordinary course of business, appropriate available legal steps to reasonably protect our intellectual property in all material jurisdictions. 
 Environmental matters 
 We generally contract with independent printers and binders for their services, and our operations are generally not otherwise affected by environmental laws and regulations. However, as the owner and lessee of real property, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the remediation of contaminated sites and the handling and disposal of wastes. It is possible that we could face liability, regardless of fault, and can be held jointly or severally liable, if contamination were to be discovered on the properties that we own or lease or on properties that we have formerly owned or leased. We are currently unaware of any material environmental liabilities or other material environmental issues relating to our properties or operations and anticipate no material expenditures for compliance with environmental laws or regulations.
