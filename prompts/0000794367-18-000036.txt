In 2017, the Company’s subsidiaries provided various support functions to the Company’s retail operations on an integrated, company-wide basis.

• | The Company’s bank subsidiary, FDS Bank, provides credit processing, certain collections, customer service and credit marketing services in respect of all credit card accounts that are owned either by Department Stores National Bank (“DSNB”), a subsidiary of Citibank, N.A., or FDS Bank and that constitute a part of the credit programs of the Company’s retail operations.

Employees
As of February 3, 2018, excluding seasonal employees, the Company had approximately 130,000 employees, primarily including regular full-time and part-time. Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, the number of employees peaks in the holiday season. Approximately 7% of the Company’s employees were represented by unions as of February 3, 2018. 
Seasonality
The retail business is seasonal in nature with a high proportion of sales and operating income generated in the months of November and December. Working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, increasing in mid-summer in anticipation of the fall merchandising season and increasing substantially prior to the holiday season when the Company carries significantly higher inventory levels.
Purchasing
The Company purchases merchandise from many suppliers, no one of which accounted for more than 5% of the Company’s purchases during 2017. The Company has no material long-term purchase commitments with any of its suppliers, and believes that it is not dependent on any one supplier. The Company considers its relations with its suppliers to be good.

Competition
The retail industry is intensely competitive. The Company’s operations compete with many retail formats, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, off-price and discount stores, manufacturers’ outlets, online retailers, catalogs and television shopping, among others. The Company seeks to attract customers by offering most wanted selections, obvious value, and distinctive marketing in stores that are located in premier locations, and by providing an exciting shopping environment and superior service through an omnichannel experience. Other retailers may compete for customers on some or all of these bases, or on other bases, and may be perceived by some potential customers as being better aligned with their particular preferences.
