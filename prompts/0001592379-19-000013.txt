ITEM 1. Business

General

Papa Murphy’s Holdings, Inc. is a franchisor and operator of the largest Take ‘N’ Bake pizza chain in the United States. We were founded in 1981 and have a total of 1,437 system-wide stores as of December 31, 2018. 
We have defined three reportable segments for the Company: Company Stores, Franchise, and Brand Funds. Financial information about segment operations appears in Selected Financial Data, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Note 20—Segment Information of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are a Delaware corporation that was organized and then acquired a majority of the capital stock of PMI Holdings, Inc., our predecessor, in 2010. In May 2014, we completed our initial public offering of our common stock (the “IPO”) and now our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the “FRSH” ticker symbol. Papa Murphy’s Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries are sometimes referred to as the “Company,” “Papa Murphy’s,” or in the first person as “we,” “us,” and “our” in this report.

Our Concept

The Papa Murphy’s experience is different from traditional pizza restaurants. Our customers:

• | CREATE their fresh, personally customized pizza with high quality ingredients;


• | TAKE their fresh pizza home; and


• | BAKE their pizza fresh in their ovens, at their convenience, for a home-cooked meal served hot.

We were founded on the core values of "Great Quality, Great Value, Great Customer Service" and we strive to deliver on these values every day. 

• | Great Quality: We have continually focused on quality since our founding and we believe customers can taste the difference. Unlike some of our competitors, we do not use pre-shredded, pre-packaged, or frozen cheese and our dough is made from scratch daily, never frozen.


• | Great Value: We offer a high quality pizza at a value price point.


• | Great Customer Service: We train our store crews to greet each customer, to promote the latest new products and to assist each customer in choosing the combination of fresh made pizzas and side items to complete the customer’s meal.

We actively target solving the “dinnertime dilemma” by providing a scratch-made, customized, home-baked meal. Our concept has broad appeal and is focused on freshness, quality, and convenience.

• | We make our dough fresh in each store daily, starting with flour, water, and yeast;


• | We grate our cheese daily from blocks of 100% whole-milk mozzarella cheese;


• | We slice fresh, never-frozen vegetables by hand;


• | We feature specialty, premium ingredients;


• | We use only high quality meats with no added fillers; and

• | We provide a convenient, easy, meal-time solution.

Our stores feature a food-forward design with a store layout that highlights our high quality, scratch-made pizzas. Pizzas are made fresh to order and our customers can follow their pizza as it is created.
Our menu offers customers the ability to create a customized pizza from a broad selection of crusts, sauces, and topping combinations. Our core menu offerings include the following:

▪ | Signature pizzas: classic combinations with broad appeal;


▪ | Gourmet Delite pizzas: our artisan thin crust with premium, specialty toppings;


▪ | Stuffed pizzas: two-layer, four-pound pizzas with meats and vegetables stuffed between two layers of dough;


▪ | Fresh Pan pizzas: signature recipes with a thick, buttery crust; and


▪ | “C.Y.O.” or Create Your Own pizzas: customer choice of crust, sauce, and any combination of our cheese, meat, and vegetable toppings.

We have developed a loyal and diverse customer base. We attribute our success across a national footprint to the broad appeal of our concept. Our business model resonates across all ages, demographics, and income levels. Finally, we believe our model encourages a stronger emotional connection. The active role of ordering and watching the pizza being built gives customers a feeling of ownership: “a pizza” becomes “my pizza.”
Efficient, Simple Operating Model
Our stores average just 1,400 square feet in size and do not require ovens, venting hoods, freezers, or dining areas. Our store model offers franchise owners operating advantages that differentiate us from other restaurant concepts. Our domestic stores:

• | Focus on creating fresh pizzas for carry out, reducing operational complexity for franchise owners and their employees;


• | Maintain shorter operating hours (typically 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.) that are attractive to franchise owners and their employees;


• | Require fewer employees each shift compared to other restaurant concepts, resulting in lower labor costs;


• | Accept electronic benefit transfer (“EBT”) payment systems (food stamps);


• | Benefit from local cooperative marketing and consistent creative marketing assets for use in a variety of media channels;


• | Utilize a centrally-managed, locally customizable, integrated e-commerce platform; and


• | Receive strong franchisor support through training, operating standards, supply-chain management, and development assistance.


Our Strategy

Our strategy remains consistent around four key components: (i) convenience; (ii) relevance; (iii) people; and (iv) process. We believe that successfully implementing these strategic components will enable us to achieve our growth and profitability targets and leverage our current infrastructure.
Convenience
We believe convenience is our differentiating attribute because our customers have control over when they order, receive, bake, and serve our fresh, hot, made to order pizza. Customers decide exactly when their pizza goes into and comes out of their oven for maximum convenience and freshness. We believe customers want a product that is easy to order, easy to pay for, and easy to obtain. 

• | E-commerce and Online Ordering. We continue to improve our e-commerce platform to provide a consistent and convenient online ordering experience for consumers. To remain relevant, we have designed systems that have the flexibility to advertise and promote special products or promotions as well as provide convenience to the consumer through ease of ordering and payment. We believe our e-commerce platform enables owners to realize greater efficiencies in store labor costs and provide an easy consumer experience through multiple ordering platforms and integration with third party delivery services.

• | Expansion of Delivery. Online ordering addresses only part of the convenience cycle. In 2018, we continued expansion of delivery through the use of various third-party delivery options as they became available in the markets we serve. Our research indicates a strong demand for delivery from our customers, with more than half indicating they would order more often if delivery was available. We have a unique opportunity with delivery because our pizzas are not baked and customers receive the same high quality fresh food when delivered as when they pick up their order in-store.

Relevance
As we strive to provide fresh, hot, and convenient options for the “dinnertime dilemma,” we must ensure that our messaging and brand strategy resonate with consumers in a competitive marketplace. We have broadened our marketing messaging and focus on telling the right story to the right audience.

• | Increased Digital Marketing. We continue to learn which value offers drive traffic by testing a broad range of messages through a variety of media channels, including social media, text, and email. Through this dynamic, strategic shift in media mix, we have begun to capture consumer ordering and shopping trends in a rapidly changing marketplace. The insights gained from this data enable us to rapidly adapt to changes in consumer preferences and develop increasingly effective digital marketing campaigns.


• | Loyalty Program. We are in the early stages of developing a loyalty program on a digital platform intended to increase the frequency of purchases.


• | Improved Messaging. To better communicate the brand’s benefits and differentiation, we have refined our consumer messaging to reach a broader audience across all communication points. Emphasis will be placed on empowering consumers and providing them with control over ingredients, quality, and timing.


• | Targeted Communication. In order to increase the effectiveness of our messaging, we have focused on reaching customers through targeted communications and offers.

People
By cultivating a culture of teamwork, continuous learning, and development, we expect to improve productivity and performance throughout our organization.

• | Franchisee Relations. Developing and maintaining strong relations with franchise owners are crucial components to our business strategy. With 1,400 stores across the United States and 460 domestic franchise owners as of December 31, 2018, we have a diverse base of owners who can help cultivate ingenuity, entrepreneurship, and community connections that are key to successful store-level operations. Engaging with franchise owners from a perspective of cooperation will allow us to learn best practices for ensuring quality, value, and service, as well as help all franchise owners execute our strategy locally on a consistent basis.


• | Field Support. To help our franchise owners operate a profitable business and to protect our brand standards, we deploy teams located across the country to provide support in operations, store technology, and marketing. These teams assist franchise owners by coaching them on strategies for reaching new audiences, operating their stores with maximum efficiency, and building brand awareness and community engagement locally through offering employment opportunities, providing a high quality convenient meal, and partnering with local organizations to give back to the community.

Process
In order to achieve optimal results, we are focusing efforts on creating an efficient, consistent execution process.

• | Spending Optimization. We continue to optimize and prioritize our spending to deliver improved store-level and support center financial results. We are prioritizing initiatives that focus on the areas of store operations, growth channels, business reviews, advertising relevance, and real-time sales analytics with the intended result of stabilizing comparable store sales figures and improving profitability.


• | Consumer Experience. We believe a consistent, high quality consumer experience in product, service, and advertising is key to building a strong brand. In addition, providing franchise owners with access to real-time store performance metrics will allow them to quickly optimize their store operations, identify trends in customer patterns, and improve overall store economics.

Our Industry and Competition

With system-wide sales of $809 million in fiscal year 2018, we are the fifth largest pizza chain in the United States measured by system-wide sales and total number of stores. We generally compete on the basis of product quality, variety, price, location, image, convenience, and service with regional and local pizza restaurants as well as national chains such as Domino’s Pizza®, Pizza Hut®, Papa John’s®, and Little Caesars Pizza®. The quick service restaurant (“QSR”) pizza market, a subset of the overall pizza category, was about $37 billion in 2018. We believe the QSR pizza restaurant market continues to be an attractive category due to its size and growth, as well as its fragmented competitive landscape. 
On a broader scale, we compete with other limited service restaurants (“LSRs”), the overall food service industry, grocery and convenience stores, and online meal kit delivery services. The food service industry, particularly LSRs, are competitive with respect to product quality, price, location, service, and convenience. Many of our competitors have been in existence for longer periods of time and have developed stronger brand awareness in markets where we compete. In these markets, we compete for customers, employees, management personnel, franchisees, and real estate sites suitable for our stores.

Suppliers and Distribution

We enter into national supply or pricing agreements with various key third-party suppliers. We negotiate pricing for our franchised and Company-owned stores with national pricing agreements covering a term of three months to one year. We do not realize any profits from the sale of these supplies to franchise owners. 
We rely on multiple third-party distributors as our primary distributors of cheese, refrigerated items, meat, canned and dry goods, paper and disposables, and janitorial supplies. Pursuant to our distribution service agreements, we have the right to designate the brands and products supplied. Supplies are delivered to each store one to two times each week.
For our beverage products, we rely on Pepsi-Cola Advertising and Marketing, Inc. (“Pepsi”) as our primary provider of packaged beverage products. We have maintained a national distribution relationship with Pepsi since 2004.

Intellectual Property and Trademarks

We regard the Papa Murphy’s brand name and associated trademarks as valuable assets. We have a portfolio of 31 trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have also secured trademark registrations for our brand name in multiple countries outside of the United States in which we currently conduct business or may consider conducting business in the future. All of the marks we own cover store-related services and/or food products.

Management Information/Technology Systems

Our point-of-sale system (“POS system”) has been customized specifically for Papa Murphy’s stores, and we use this integrated restaurant-level technology for inventory, labor management and cash handling in our domestic stores. Our POS system allows us to track sales data and evaluate store efficiency. Through our POS system we are able to collect, utilize, and disseminate data and information collected by each store to generate reports and evaluate sales performance in real-time. In addition, we collect monthly store-level profit and loss statements for analysis.
We continue to make substantial investments to further develop our e-commerce capabilities and platform, including a new Papa Murphy’s website and mobile application ordering system. This ordering channel, fully integrated with our in-store POS system, enables us to gather more information about customer ordering habits, which we believe will enable us to further develop attractive offers and increase sales with digital marketing.

Franchising Overview

Our store base was 92.6% franchised as of December 31, 2018, with our franchise owners operating a total of 1,331 Papa Murphy’s stores in 37 states, Canada, and the Middle East. Through our franchise support, development infrastructure, and screening process, we have successfully built a base of 469 franchise owners with an average store ownership of approximately 2.8 stores per franchise owner. As of December 31, 2018, a majority of our franchise owners owned one store, approximately 73% owned one or two stores, and approximately 24% of all franchised stores were owned by our 10 largest franchise owners. We believe this highly diversified owner base demonstrates the viability of our store concept across numerous types of owners and operators, and the relationships we have with our franchise owners provide a solid platform for growth. 
We are dedicated to providing the tools our franchise owners need to succeed before, during, and after a store opening, including assistance with site selection and development, training, operations, and marketing. We set forth qualification criteria and provide training programs for franchise owners to ensure that every Papa Murphy’s store meets the same quality and customer service standards to preserve the consistency and reliability of the Papa Murphy’s brand. 
Our asset-light franchised business model offers us strategic and financial benefits. It enables us to focus Company resources on menu innovation, marketing, franchise owner training, and operations support to drive the overall success of our brand. Our franchised business model also allows us to grow our store base and brand awareness with limited corporate capital investment. Further, our predominantly franchised business model reduces our exposure to changes in commodity and other operating costs. As a result, our business model is designed to provide high operating margins and cash flows with low capital expenditures and working capital.

Employees

As of March 1, 2019, we had 1,288 employees, including 236 salaried employees and 1,052 hourly employees. None of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our current employee relations to be good.

Government Regulation

We, along with our franchise owners, are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws affecting the operation of our respective businesses. Each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, building, and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the store operates. In order to maintain our stores, we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal, state, local, and foreign regulations, including regulations that require remodeled stores to be accessible to persons with disabilities. Difficulties in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store. Our domestic store operations are subject to various federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, benefits, working conditions, citizenship requirements, and overtime. We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations.
We are subject to Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) rules and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC requires us to furnish to prospective franchise owners a franchise disclosure document containing prescribed information. Some states and foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship. These laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension of future franchise sales, fines, or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
