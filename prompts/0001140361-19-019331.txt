Our restoration team provides invasive species management, stream and shoreline habitat restoration, bank stabilization, fish passage, and other services to clients and is focused on expanding over 20 years of experience in these areas to new clients and geographies. Funding for water and ecosystem restoration projects comes from Natural Resource Damage Assessment funds, federal programs, local agency contracts, and non-government organization and other grant-funded projects.
Contract Backlog
 
Firm backlog represents an estimate of gross revenue that will be recognized over the remaining life of the projects under contracts that are awarded, funded and in progress.  These projects include work to be performed under contracts which contain termination provisions that may be exercised without penalty at any time by our clients upon written notice to us, in which case the client would only be obligated to pay us for services provided through the termination date.  A significant portion of our revenue is generated through projects awarded under Master Service Agreements with our clients.  In these instances, only the current unfinished projects are included in our backlog.
 
Firm backlog by operating segment is summarized in the following table.

 | July 31, 2019 | | July 31, 2018 | 
--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+--------+---------------+--
 | (in thousands) | 
Total firm backlog of uncompleted contracts: | | | | 
U.S. operations | $ | 47,795 | | $ | 42,878 | (a)
South American operations | | 13,057 | | | 9,462 | 
Consolidated totals | $ | 60,852 | | $ | 52,340 | 
Anticipated completion of firm backlog in next twelve months: | | | | | | 
U.S. operations | $ | 32,472 | | $ | 19,083 | (a)
South American operations | | 11,262 | | | 8,322 | 
Consolidated totals | $ | 43,734 | | $ | 27,405 | 


(a) | During fiscal year 2019, the Company revised its methodology for determining the contract values to be included in firm backlog within its U.S. operations. Under this revised methodology, certain backlog amounts that previously were classified and reported as firm backlog are now reported as soft backlog (as defined below). In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, the Company reported firm backlog from U.S. operations of $49.1 million, of which $43.0 million was expected to be completed within the subsequent twelve-month period. For comparative purposes, management recalculated firm backlog retroactively as of July 31, 2018 using project funding data contemporaneous with that reporting period and other project status information known at the time. Although management believes that the data is generally comparable by using a more consistent methodology, there can be no assurance that the methodologies are entirely comparable for all backlog balances reported as of July 31, 2019 and 2018. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



As of the end of fiscal year 2019, total firm backlog from U.S. and South American operations increased 11% and 38%, respectively, as compared to the end of the prior fiscal year, as new orders reported as additions to firm backlog exceeded work delivered on active projects.
 
In addition to the firm backlog summarized in the table above, we also have been awarded contracts in our U.S. operations that are partially or entirely unfunded, but which are expected to be partially or entirely funded during the remaining life of the associated projects.  Total unfunded backlog approximated $16.8 million and $10.5 million for our U.S. operations at July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Until these projects are funded, we cannot be certain regarding the value of gross revenue that we will recognize under these contracts.
 
Backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and is not a measure of profitability. Our method for calculating backlog may not be comparable to methodologies used by other companies.
 
Competition
 
We are subject to competition with respect to each of the services that we provide.  We believe that no single entity currently dominates the environmental services industry or has the capability to serve the entire market.  Some of our competitors are larger than us, have greater financial and other resources than we do, or may be more specialized in certain disciplines or locations.  Other U.S. competitors have special status as small businesses, which allows them to compete for U.S. government contracts set-aside to be awarded exclusively to small business concerns.  We compete primarily on the basis of our reputation, quality of service, expertise, responsiveness and price.
Management Team and Employees
 
Our management and staff are comprised of individuals with advanced degrees representing scientific and engineering disciplines working together in multidisciplinary teams to provide innovative solutions.  The members of our executive management team have extensive experience in the environmental consulting industry.
 
As of July 31, 2019, we had 748 employees (644 full-time) in all of our offices, which included 434 employees (337 full-time) in domestic offices and 314 employees (307 full-time) in foreign offices of consolidated subsidiaries.
 
In March 2019, we initiated specific staff reduction initiatives pursuant to a plan to restructure the Company’s U.S. operations.  Refer to Item 7 of this Annual Report for additional commentary regarding the Staff Reduction Programs.
