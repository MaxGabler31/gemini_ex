Item 1. Business.
BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
Curtiss-Wright Corporation and its subsidiaries (we, the Corporation, or the Company) is a global integrated business that provides highly engineered products, solutions, and services mainly to aerospace & defense markets, as well as critical technologies in demanding commercial power, process, and industrial markets. We expect that the diversification and breadth of our portfolio should improve our competitive positions in our core markets, mitigate the impact of business cycle or economic volatility, and allow us to drive growth in new products and markets. We believe we are well positioned in the markets in which we operate as we seek to leverage and build upon our critical mass to expand our global engineering, sales, support and manufacturing footprint. 
We believe we are well positioned on high-performance platforms and critical applications that require our technical sophistication and benefit from decades of engineering expertise and knowledge transfer. Our portfolio of highly competitive technologies are relied upon to improve safety, operating efficiency, and reliability, while meeting performance requirements in the most demanding environments. Our ability to provide mission critical, niche products and services on a cost-effective basis is fundamental to our strategy to drive increased value to our customers. We compete globally, primarily based on technology and pricing. 
We strive for consistent growth in sales, operating margin, diluted earnings per share and free cash flow, steady reinvestment back into the business, and a disciplined capital deployment strategy consisting of acquisitions and returns to shareholders, to drive long-term shareholder value.
Business Segments
We manage and evaluate our operations based on the products and services we offer and the different markets we serve. Based on this approach, we operate through three reportable segments: Aerospace & Industrial, Defense Electronics, and Naval & Power.
Our principal domestic manufacturing facilities are located in Arizona, California, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina, and internationally in Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. 
Aerospace & Industrial
Sales in the Aerospace & Industrial segment are primarily generated from the general industrial and commercial aerospace markets and, to a lesser extent, the defense markets. The businesses in this segment provide a diversified offering of highly engineered products and services including: (i.) industrial and specialty vehicle products, such as electronic throttle control devices, joysticks, and transmission shifters, (ii.) sensors, controls, and electro-mechanical actuation components used on commercial and military aircraft, and (iii.) surface technology services, such as shot peening, laser peening, and engineered coatings. Certain industrial businesses within our Aerospace & Industrial segment are impacted primarily by general economic conditions, which may include consumer consumption or commercial construction rates, as the nature of their products and services primarily support global industrial, commercial vehicles, medical, and transportation industries. The commercial aerospace business is primarily impacted by original equipment manufacturers (OEM) production rates of new aircraft, while the defense business is primarily impacted by government funding and spending on new programs, primarily driven by the U.S. Government. The production and service processes rest primarily within material modification, machining, assembly, and testing and inspection at commercial grade specifications. The businesses distribute products through commercial sales and marketing channels.
Defense Electronics
Sales in the Defense Electronics segment are primarily to the defense markets and, to a lesser extent, the commercial aerospace market. The defense businesses in this segment provide a diversified offering of products including: Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) embedded computing board-level modules, data acquisition and flight test instrumentation equipment, integrated subsystems, instrumentation and control systems, tactical communications solutions for battlefield network management, and electronic stabilization products. The defense businesses within our Defense Electronics segment are impacted primarily by government funding and spending, driven primarily by the U.S. Government. Our products typically support government entities in the aerospace defense, ground defense, and naval defense industries. As a result, we have varying degrees of platform-level content on fighter jets, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), ground vehicles, and nuclear and non-nuclear surface ships and submarines. Additionally, we provide avionics and electronics, flight test equipment, and aircraft data management solutions to the commercial aerospace market. Our defense businesses supporting government contractors typically utilize more advanced and ruggedized production and service processes compared to our commercial businesses and have more stringent specifications and performance requirements. The businesses in this segment typically market and distribute products through regulated government contracting channels.
Naval & Power
Sales in the Naval & Power segment are primarily to the naval defense and power & process markets. For the naval defense market, we provide naval propulsion and auxiliary equipment, including main coolant pumps, power-dense compact motors, generators, steam turbines, valves, and secondary propulsion systems, primarily to the U.S. Navy. We also provide ship repair and maintenance for the U.S. Navy’s Atlantic and Pacific fleets through three service centers. The defense businesses in this segment are primarily impacted by government funding and spending on shipbuilding programs, primarily driven by the U.S. Government. For the power & process markets, we provide a diversified offering of products for commercial nuclear power plants and nuclear equipment manufacturers, including hardware, pumps, valves, fastening systems, specialized containment doors, airlock hatches, and spent fuel management products supporting the continued performance, safety and modernization of operating reactors. We also provide Reactor Coolant Pumps (RCPs) and control rod drive mechanisms for commercial nuclear power plants, most notably to support the Generation III+ Westinghouse AP1000 reactor design. In addition, we furnish specialized and innovative severe-service valve technologies and services, heat exchanger repair, and piping test and isolation products to the oil and gas, chemical, petrochemical and industrial markets worldwide. The businesses in this segment are dependent upon the need for ongoing maintenance, repair and overhaul of existing power plants, as well as the construction of new power plants globally, and typically market and distribute products through regulated or government contracting channels.
OTHER INFORMATION
Certain Financial Information
For information regarding sales by geographic region, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In 2021, 2020, and 2019, our foreign operations as a percentage of pre-tax earnings were 27%, 28%, and 31%, respectively, adjusted for impairment losses associated with our industrial valves business in Germany in 2021 and 2020. 
Government Sales
Our sales to the U.S. Government and foreign government end use represented 55%, 53%, and 43% of total net sales during 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 
In accordance with normal U.S. Government business practices, contracts and orders are subject to partial or complete termination at any time at the option of the customer. In the event of a termination for convenience by the government, there generally are provisions for recovery of our allowable incurred costs and a proportionate share of the profit or fee on the work completed, consistent with regulations of the U.S. Government. Fixed-price redeterminable contracts usually provide that we absorb the majority of any cost overrun. In the event that there is a cost underrun, the customer recoups a portion of the underrun based upon a formula in which the customer’s portion increases as the underrun exceeds certain established levels.
Generally, long-term contracts with the U.S. Government require us to invest in and carry significant levels of inventory. However, where allowable, we utilize progress payments and other interim billing practices on nearly all of these contracts, thus reducing working capital requirements. It is our policy to seek customary progress payments on certain contracts. Where we obtain such payments under U.S. Government prime contracts or subcontracts, the U.S. Government generally has control of the materials and work in process allocable or chargeable to the respective contracts. (See Notes 1, 5, and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Customers
We have hundreds of customers in the various industries that we serve. No commercial customer accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales during 2021, 2020, or 2019.
Approximately 50% of our total net sales for 2021, 47% for 2020, and 38% for 2019 were derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. Information on our sales to the U.S. Government, including both direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor, is as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
(In thousands) | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Aerospace & Industrial | $ | 155,276 | | | $ | 156,981 | | $ | 142,666
Defense Electronics | 600,085 | | | 470,949 | | | 367,923
Naval & Power | 499,486 | | | 491,388 | | | 426,116
Total U.S. Government sales | $ | 1,254,847 | | | $ | 1,119,318 | | $ | 936,705

Patents
We own and license a number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications, which have been obtained or filed over a period of years. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. Specifically, the U.S. Government receives licenses to our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the technology covered by such patents for government purposes. Additionally, trade secrets, unpatented research and development, and engineering, some of which have been acquired by the company through business acquisitions, make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business, we do not consider the success of our business or business segments to be materially dependent upon the timing of expiration or protection of any one or group of patents, patent applications, or patent license agreements under which we now operate.

Human Capital
At the end of 2021, we had approximately 7,800 employees in more than 20 countries, 7% of which are represented by labor unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
Set forth below are some of the key aspects of Curtiss-Wright’s human capital strategy:
Compensation Programs and Employee Benefits
Our success as an organization is ultimately dependent upon the success of our employees. As a result, we have made significant investments in order to attract, develop, and retain talented personnel, inclusive of competitive pay, equity-based compensation, benefits, training, and professional development opportunities. Notable programs offered include the following:
•Employer 401(k) matching contributions; 
•Employee Stock Purchase Plan;
•Employer-sponsored health insurance;
•Tuition reimbursement program; and
•Training and professional development
In addition to the above, we also offer equity-based compensation plans to certain employees through the issuance of performance share units, restricted stock units, and cash-based performance units. Our equity compensation plans ultimately act as a key lever for rewarding and retaining key employees, while also aligning the interests of our key employees and shareholders. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our equity-based compensation plans.
Diversity and Inclusion
Curtiss-Wright believes in a diverse and inclusive workforce, where diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged, and empowered to inspire and innovate. Discrimination is not tolerated at Curtiss-Wright. We are committed to high ethical standards and equal employment opportunities in all personnel actions without regard to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, citizenship status, age, marital status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, or veteran status. We maintain a Code of Conduct, an anti-harassment policy, and an equal employment opportunity policy, and provide training on these policies annually. We do business in more than 20 countries, and our employees operate across cultures, functions, language barriers, and time zones to solve the technical and logistical challenges presented by its worldwide customer base. To foster a more diverse and inclusive culture, Curtiss-Wright is focused on (1) promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion that leverages the talents of all employees, and (2) implementing practices that attract, recruit, and retain diverse top talent. Our succession plans are geared at retaining and promoting our existing employees to provide equal opportunity and access to promotion within the organization. 
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for Curtiss-Wright. We take steps to ensure that we comply with applicable legal, regulatory, and other requirements in all material respects related to preventing pollution, injury, and ill health, and employ industry-leading, technologically sound, and economically feasible control mechanisms, procedures, and processes. In addition, we provide training, education, safety monitoring and auditing, and health-awareness programs in our offices and factories. We track total recordable rate (TRR) and days away, restriction and transfer rate (DART) for all sites worldwide. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our TRR and DART rates were 1.49 and 0.99, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our TRR and DART rates were 0.98 and 0.65, respectively.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to promote the importance of being vaccinated and execute safety measures at all facilities to protect the health and safety of our employees and visitors. We have implemented rigorous hygiene and social distancing practices, inclusive of mask requirements and staggered shifts. Additionally, we implemented requirements regarding mandatory vaccines for U.S. based covered employees, subject to approved exemptions. Furthermore, a significant portion of our non-manufacturing employees are currently working remotely on a hybrid basis, where practicable to do so, in an effort to minimize any potential spread of COVID-19. These working conditions have been designed to allow for the continuation of key business-critical operations and controls. 
Ethics and Integrity
Curtiss-Wright is deeply committed to ensuring that all of its employees conduct business with the highest levels of ethics and integrity and to complying with all laws and regulations applicable to Curtiss-Wright’s businesses. To support and articulate our commitment and responsibility in this regard, Curtiss-Wright has adopted a Code of Conduct (the “Code”). The Code addresses several topics, including conflicts of interest, safeguarding assets, financial reporting, the protection of confidential information, insider trading, and general adherence to laws and regulations. All employees, including executive officers, must comply with the Code. The Code is available within the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website at https://investors.curtisswright.com/governance/governance-documents. In order to enhance understanding of and compliance with the Code, all employees are required to complete a training program annually which details ethical business practices, an inclusive workforce, and respectful treatment of our employees. In addition, the Corporation maintains an ethics-related global hotline through which employees can report any issues of concern. The hotline facilitates the communication of ethical, financial, discrimination, and health and safety concerns and serves as the vehicle through which employees may communicate with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors confidentially and anonymously regarding any accounting, internal controls, or auditing concerns.
