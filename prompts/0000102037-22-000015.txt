Item 1.  Business 
A.    The Company 
Overview 
We are a global business-to-business agri-products supplier to consumer product manufacturers, operating in over 30 countries on five continents. We strive to be the supplier of choice for our customers by leveraging our farmer base, our commitment to a sustainable supply chain, and our ability to provide high-quality, customized, traceable, value-added agri-products essential for our customers’ requirements. We find innovative solutions to serve our customers and have been meeting their agri-product needs for more than 100 years. Our principal focus since our founding in 1918 has been tobacco, and we are the leading global leaf tobacco supplier. The largest portion of our business involves procuring and processing flue-cured, burley, and dark air-cured leaf tobacco for manufacturers of consumer tobacco products. Through our plant-based ingredients platform, we provide a variety of value-added manufacturing processes to produce high-quality, specialty vegetable- and fruit-based ingredients as well as botanical extracts and flavorings for human and pet food end markets. We do not manufacture any direct to consumer products. Rather, we support consumer product manufacturers by selling them agri-products and performing related services for them. 
Recognizing that leaf tobacco is a mature industry, we have been positioning our company for the future by investing in and strengthening our plant-based ingredients platform, while maintaining our position as the leading global leaf tobacco supplier. In fiscal year 2022, we continued to make progress towards building and enhancing our plant-based ingredients platform. On October 4, 2021, we acquired Shank’s Extracts, LLC (“Shank’s”), a specialty ingredient botanical extract and flavorings company with bottling and packaging capabilities. We have been integrating and exploring opportunities for synergies between our acquired businesses, FruitSmart, Inc. (“FruitSmart”), acquired on January 1, 2020, Silva International, Inc. (“Silva”), acquired on October 1, 2020, and Shank’s.
We generated approximately $2.1 billion in consolidated revenues and earned $160.3 million in total operating income and $174.3 million in total segment operating income in fiscal year 2022. Universal Corporation is a holding company that operates through numerous directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries. Universal Corporation’s primary subsidiaries are Universal Leaf Tobacco Company, Incorporated ("Universal Leaf"), which is associated with our Tobacco Operations segment, and Universal Global Ventures, Incorporated, which is associated with our Ingredients Operations segment. See Exhibit 21, “Subsidiaries of the Registrant,” for additional subsidiary information.

B.    Description of Business 
Given the significant and strategic investments in our plant-based ingredients platform, we evaluated our operating segments for financial reporting purposes during the quarter ended December 31, 2020. Based on our evaluation, we determined that we conduct our operations across two primary reportable operating segments, Tobacco Operations and Ingredients Operations. The segments reflect how we manage our Company, allocate resources, and assess business performance. Prior period segment information has been recast retrospectively to reflect these changes.
Tobacco Operations 
Our primary business is contracting, procuring, financing, processing, packing, storing, and shipping leaf tobacco for sale to manufacturers of consumer tobacco products throughout the world. Procuring leaf tobacco involves contracting with, providing agronomy support to, and financing farmers in many origins. We do not manufacture cigarettes or other consumer tobacco products. Rather, we support consumer product manufacturers by selling them processed leaf tobacco and performing related services for them. Through various operating subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates located in tobacco-growing origins around the world, we contract, purchase, process, and sell flue-cured, burley, and dark air-cured tobaccos, as well as oriental tobaccos. Flue-cured, burley, and oriental tobaccos are used principally in the manufacture of cigarettes as well as in shisha, while dark air-cured tobaccos are used mainly in the manufacture of cigars, natural wrapped cigars and cigarillos, smokeless, and pipe tobacco products. Some of these tobacco types are also increasingly used in the manufacture of next generation tobacco products that are intended to provide consumers with a reduced-risk alternative to traditional combustible tobacco products. We also provide value-added services to our customers, including blending, chemical and physical testing of tobacco, service cutting for select manufacturers, manufacturing reconstituted leaf tobacco, and managing just-in-time inventory. 
Several important operating factors characterize our Company and our primary business, leaf tobacco:
•Experience dealing with large numbers of farmers,
•Expertise in delivering a sustainable supply of compliant, traceable, competitively-priced leaf tobacco,
•Capability to meet unique customer requirements for style, volume and quality,
•Longstanding customer, farmer and community relationships,
•Presence in all major leaf tobacco sourcing areas, and 
•Financial strength and flexibility.
In addition to our leaf tobacco business, we are involved in other smaller-scale tobacco opportunities. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, AmeriNic, Inc., produces liquid nicotine for next generation tobacco products. AmeriNic’s products are manufactured under stringent United States Pharmacopeia standards. Global Laboratory Services, Inc., another wholly-owned subsidiary, provides testing for crop protection agents and tobacco constituents in seed, leaf, and finished products, including e-cigarette liquids and vapors, and has capabilities for testing non-tobacco products. Analytical services include chemical compound testing in finished tobacco products and mainstream smoke. We also have a U.S. based business that recycles waste materials from tobacco production. 
We believe that by following several key operating principles in our tobacco operations we can continue to produce good financial returns and enhance shareholder value. These key operating principles are: 
•Strategic market position. We work closely with both our customers and our suppliers to ensure that we deliver a product that meets our customers' needs while cultivating a strong, sustainable supplier base. We balance product purchases against indicated customer demand and maintain global procurement and production operations to maximize supply chain efficiencies.
•Strong local management. Having strong local management in all of our key supply origins allows us to identify and react to constantly shifting market conditions. Empowered and experienced local management, coupled with global coordination, affords us the flexibility and knowledge necessary to adapt quickly in order to continually deliver high quality, competitively-priced products and services. 
•Compliant products. Customers expect a sustainable supply of compliant, traceable, competitively-priced product, and we believe that we lead in delivering these products. Among other initiatives, we invest in training farmers in good agricultural practices ("GAP") that encompass crop quality, sustainability, environmental stewardship and agricultural labor standards. 
•Diversified sources. Our business is reliant on a strong and resilient supply chain, which enables us to deliver a stable supply of quality products to our customers. We operate in over 30 countries on five continents and maintain a presence in all major flue-cured, burley, oriental, and dark air-cured tobacco origin markets. This global presence allows us to meet our customers' diverse product requirements while minimizing the effects of adverse crop conditions and other localized supply disruptions.
•Financial strength. Financial strength is critical and enables us to fund our global operations efficiently and to facilitate investment when suitable opportunities arise. Management of liquidity, interest expense, and capital costs provides us with a competitive advantage, affords us flexibility when responding to customer requirements and market changes, and allows us to enhance shareholder value.
With respect to our leaf tobacco business, we generate our revenues from product sales of processed, packed tobacco that we source, from processing fees for tobacco owned by third parties, and from fees for other services. Sales to our largest customers, with whom we have longstanding relationships, have accounted for more than 60% of our consolidated revenues for each of the past three fiscal years. Our sales consist primarily of flue-cured, burley, and dark air-cured tobaccos. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, our Tobacco Operations segment accounted for 87% of our revenues and 90% of our segment operating income.
We conduct our leaf tobacco business in varying degrees in a number of countries, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, France, Germany, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malawi, Mexico, Mozambique, the Netherlands, Paraguay, the People’s Republic of China, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Zimbabwe. In addition, our oriental tobacco joint venture, Socotab, L.L.C. ("Socotab") has operations in Bulgaria, Greece, the Republic of North Macedonia, and Turkey.
Because unprocessed, or “green,” leaf tobacco is a perishable product, timely processing is an essential service to our customers. Our processing of leaf tobacco includes grading in the factories, blending, removal of non-tobacco material, separation of leaf from the stems, drying, packing to precise moisture targets for proper aging, as well as temporary storage. This generally requires investments in factories and machinery in areas where the tobacco is grown. Processed tobacco that has been properly packed can be stored by customers for a number of years prior to use, but most processed tobacco is used within two to three years. 
We are a major purchaser and processor in the primary exporting regions for flue-cured and burley tobacco throughout the world. Africa, Brazil, and the United States produce approximately two-thirds of the flue-cured and burley tobacco grown outside of China. We estimate that over the last five years we have handled, through leaf sales or processing, on average between 25% and 35% of the annual production of such tobaccos in Africa, between 35% and 45% and the United States, and between 15% and 25% in Brazil. These percentages can change from year to year based on the size, price, and quality of the crops. We participate in the procurement, processing, storage, and sale of oriental tobacco through ownership of a 49% equity interest in Socotab, a leading supplier of oriental tobaccos. In addition, we maintain a presence, and in certain cases, a leading presence, in all other major tobacco growing regions in the world. We believe that our leading position in the leaf tobacco industry is based on our volumes handled, our operating presence in all of the major sourcing areas, our ability to meet customer style, volume, and quality requirements, our experience in dealing with large numbers of farmers, our expertise in delivering a sustainable supply of compliant, traceable, competitively-priced leaf tobacco, our long-standing relationships with customers, our development of processing equipment and technologies, and our financial position which enables us to make strategic investments in our business. The efficiencies that we offer our customers, due to our established network of operational expertise and infrastructure on the ground and our ability to market most styles and grades of leaf to a diverse customer base, are also key to our success.
We also have a leading position in worldwide dark tobacco markets. Our dark tobacco operations are located in most of the major producing countries and in other smaller markets. We operate in major dark tobacco producing countries, including the United States, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Indonesia, Paraguay, the Philippines, and Brazil. Dark tobaccos are typically used in the manufacture of cigars, pipe tobacco, and smokeless tobacco products, and as components of certain “roll-your-own” cigarette products.
Sales are made by our sales force and, to a much smaller degree, through the use of commissioned agents. Most customers are long-established tobacco product manufacturers. Customer contract arrangements vary around the world and include negotiated pricing as well as cost plus arrangements. Discussions of a customer’s longer-term needs may begin as early as one to two years in advance of a particular crop purchase. These discussions are key to our future crop production planning. Prior to planting each year, we use early customer indications for type, style, processing, and volume requirements for the upcoming season’s crop to help us determine our farmer contracting and grower input needs in our origins. We work with our farmers and customers continually throughout the crop season. As crops progress through the growing season, customers will inspect the crop, and a customer’s early indications may be refined based upon emerging crop qualities and quantities and market pricing 
expectations. Ultimately, purchase agreements specifying quantity, quality, grade and price are executed, leading to inventory allocations of harvested green or processed leaf that we have acquired.
In the majority of the countries where we operate, we contract directly with tobacco farmers or tobacco farmer cooperatives. In most countries outside the United States and the European Union, we advance seed or seedlings, fertilizer, and other agricultural inputs to farmers. These advances are repaid by farmers with the tobacco they produce. We are dedicated to promoting a sustainable farmer base and provide our farmers with agronomy support. Our GAP programs educate farmers in such matters as the reduction of non-tobacco related materials, product traceability, environmental sustainability, agricultural labor standards, and social responsibility. 
Our foreign operations are subject to international business risks, including unsettled political conditions, expropriation, import and export restrictions, exchange controls, and currency fluctuations. During the tobacco season in many of the countries listed above, we advance funds, guarantee local loans, or do both, each in substantial amounts, for the eventual purchase of tobacco. The majority of these seasonal advances and loan guarantees mature in one year or less upon the farmers’ delivery of contracted tobaccos. Most advances to farmers are denominated in local currency, which is a source of foreign currency exchange rate risk. Most tobacco sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, which reduces our foreign currency exchange risk after the tobacco has been purchased. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for more information about our foreign currency exchange and other international business risks.
Seasonality 
Our tobacco operations are seasonal in nature. Tobacco in Brazil is usually purchased from January through July, while buying in Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and other African countries typically begins around April and continues through November. Farmers begin to sell U.S. flue-cured tobacco in late July, and the marketing season lasts for approximately four months. 
We normally operate each of our tobacco processing plants for seven to nine months of the year. During this period for each region, inventories of green tobacco, inventories of processed tobacco, and trade accounts receivable normally reach peak levels in succession. We normally finance this expansion of current assets with cash, short-term borrowings from banks, and customer advances, and these funding sources normally reach their peak usage in each region during its respective purchasing or processing period. Our balance sheet at our fiscal year end reflects seasonal expansions in working capital in South America and Central America. Our financial performance is also impacted by the seasonality of our business. Due to global tobacco growing cycles, as well as customer shipment preferences, we typically ship a larger portion of our volumes in the second half of our fiscal year. Changes in customer shipment schedules or changes in crop timing in a season can shift recognition of revenue in a given fiscal year or between fiscal years.
Customers 
A material part of our tobacco business is dependent upon a few customers. Our largest customers are Altria Group Inc., British American Tobacco plc, China Tobacco International, Inc., Imperial Brands plc, Japan Tobacco, Inc., Philip Morris International, Inc., and Swedish Match AB. In the aggregate, these customers have accounted for more than 60% of our consolidated revenues for each of the past three fiscal years. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, each of British American Tobacco plc, Imperial Brands plc, and Philip Morris International, Inc., including their respective affiliates, accounted for 10% or more of our revenues. The loss of, or substantial reduction in business from, any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our results. We have longstanding relationships with all of these customers. 
We had commitments from customers for approximately $694 million of the tobacco in our inventories at March 31, 2022. Based upon historical experience, we usually expect that about 90% of such orders will be delivered during the following fiscal year. However, we expect a lower percentage of such orders will be delivered in fiscal year 2023 due to COVID-related logistical challenges. Most of our products require shipment via trucks and oceangoing vessels to reach customer destinations. Delays in the delivery of orders can result from such factors as truck and container availability, port access and capacity, vessel scheduling, and changing customer requirements for shipment. 
As more fully described in Note 1 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, we recognize revenue from the sale of tobacco when we complete our contractual performance obligation for the transfer of the tobacco, which is generally when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customer. Individual shipments may be large, and since the customer typically specifies shipping dates, our financial results may vary significantly between reporting periods due to timing of sales. In some markets, including Brazil, Italy, the Philippines, Poland, and the United States, we process tobacco that is owned by our customers, and we recognize the revenue for that service when the processing is completed.
Competition 
Competition among leaf tobacco suppliers is based on the ability to meet customer specifications in the growing, buying, processing, and financing of tobacco, and on the prices charged for products and services. Competition varies depending on the market or country involved. The number of competitors varies from country to country, but there is competition in most areas to buy and sell the available tobacco. Our principal competitor is Pyxus International, Inc. (“Pyxus”) (formerly Alliance One International, Inc.). Pyxus operates in some of the countries where we operate. However, we are the only global leaf tobacco supplier with operations in the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Mozambique, Paraguay, the Philippines, and Poland and that participates in the sale and production of dark air-cured tobaccos. We also have reconstituted tobacco sheet facilities and operations that handle dark air-cured tobacco and other tobaccos. We consider ourselves and Pyxus to be the only global leaf suppliers based on our worldwide scope of operations. Most of our major customers are partially vertically integrated, and thus also compete with us for the purchase of leaf tobacco in several of the major markets.
In most major leaf tobacco markets, smaller competitors are very active. These competitors typically have lower overhead requirements and provide less support to customers and farmers. Due to their lower cost structures, they can often offer a price on products that is lower than our price. However, we believe that we provide quality controls and farm programs that add value for our customers in an increasingly regulated world and make our products highly desirable. Our GAP support an approach to farming that is focused on sustainability, employing sound field production and labor management practices that meet our customers’ needs, promote farmer profitability, and reflect environmental sensitivity. We provide comprehensive training, technical support in the field, and crop analytics through ongoing research and development. We believe that our major customers increasingly require these services and that our programs increase the quality and value of the products and services we offer. We also believe that our customers value the security of supply that we are able to provide due to our strong relationships with our farmer base and our global footprint.
Ingredients Operations
Our ingredients businesses provide our business-to-business customers with a broad range of plant-based ingredients for both human and pet consumption. A variety of value-added manufacturing processes are used in these businesses to convert raw materials into a wide spectrum of fruit and vegetable juices, concentrates, dehydrated products, botanical extracts, and flavorings. Our plant-based ingredients platform serves the Food and Beverage market, one of the largest industrial categories in the United States. There are thousands of companies represented in this segment and hundreds that offer similar or competitive types of products. We distinguish ourselves in this market by offering high-quality, customized product solutions with global sourcing capabilities and by having strong, long-standing customer relationships. Customers of our ingredients businesses include large multinational food and beverage companies, as well as smaller independent entities. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our Ingredients Operations segment revenues in fiscal year 2022. FruitSmart, Silva, and Shank's are the primary operations for the Ingredients Operations segment. In December 2020, we announced the wind-down of Carolina Innovative Food Ingredients, Inc. (“CIFI”), a greenfield operation that primarily manufactured both dehydrated and liquid sweet potato products having determined that CIFI is not a strategic fit for the long-term objectives of our plant-based ingredients platform. Sales of remaining inventory, the sale of the CIFI manufacturing facility, and certain administrative activities at CIFI continued into fiscal year 2022. 
FruitSmart supplies a broad set of juices, concentrates, pomaces, purees, fruit fibers, seed and seed powders, and other value-added products to food, beverage and flavor companies throughout the United States and internationally. FruitSmart processes apples, grapes, blueberries, raspberries, cherries, blackberries, pears, cranberries and strawberries as well as other fruits and vegetables. Its top five products are apple juice concentrate, not from concentrate apple juice, concord grape, raspberry, and blueberry juice concentrates. The business is headquartered in the Yakima Valley of the state of Washington, where it has approximately 200 employees and two manufacturing facilities: one produces liquid products and one produces dry products. FruitSmart is well-positioned to capitalize on recent shifts in market dynamics and consumer behavior including a secular shift towards health and wellness, favoring natural clean-label ingredient producers and the rise of fruit as a natural clean-label sweetener alternative to processed sugar. FruitSmart also stands to benefit from growing consumer interest in better-for-you premium ingredients, including custom blends, not-from-concentrate and dry products, and strong growth in targeted end markets utilizing FruitSmart products, including ciders, purees and nutraceuticals. 
Silva procures over 60 types of dehydrated vegetables, fruits and herbs from over 20 countries around the world. In addition to sourcing, the company specializes in processing natural materials into custom designed dehydrated vegetable and fruit-based ingredients for a variety of end products. Its top five ingredient product categories are vegetable blends, peppers, spinach, carrots, and pumpkin. Headquartered in Momence, Illinois, Silva employs over 200 people and has a 380,000 square foot manufacturing facility. Silva has established a reputation as the ‘go-to’ provider for ‘clean,’ natural, specialty dehydrated vegetable and fruit-based ingredients due to its unique competencies and significant capacity to source, process and manufacture materials. Silva also has longstanding relationships with farmers and suppliers around the world and maintains strong quality control procedures, ensuring consistent, high-quality supply. Silva’s manufacturing facility was recently expanded and enhanced. As a result, the business is well positioned to take advantage of increasing demand for natural and clean-label products across the end markets it serves, including within the attractive and growing savory and pet food end markets. 
Shank’s produces botanical extracts, flavorings and has bottling capabilities. Shank’s has a strong presence within the botanical extracts, flavorings, and bottling marketplace, with significant vanilla expertise. In addition to pure vanilla extract products, Shank’s offers a robust portfolio of over 2,400 other extracts, distillates, natural flavors and colors for industrial and private label customers worldwide. Shank’s employs more than 200 people and has a 191,000 square foot manufacturing campus in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The acquisition of Shank’s added flavors, custom packaging and bottling, and product development capabilities to our plant-based ingredients platform. 
Sustainability
We believe we have a fundamental responsibility to our stakeholders to set high standards of social and environmental performance to support a sustainable supply chain and operations. In 2018, Universal celebrated 100 years in business. Our 100 year anniversary was an opportunity to look back at our accomplishments, and to look forward to our future. We believe sustainability is a key component of our past and future success, and we highlighted our 100 year anniversary by publishing a Sustainability Review to promote our commitment to sustainability. Since then we have produced annual sustainability reports, and we have committed to continuing our annual sustainability reporting. Our Board of Directors further evidenced our commitment to sustainability by amending our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter to give the Committee oversight of our Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") programs.
Our commitment to sustainability encompasses a wide array of programs and initiatives. As a global agri-products supplier operating in numerous countries around the world, we primarily focus our sustainability efforts on our own operations and the farmers from whom we purchase leaf tobacco and other food materials. Sustainability efforts with respect to our facilities around the world involve the adoption and implementation of policies and procedures related to environmental impacts, workforce protections and programs such as those we address in “Human Capital Management” below, and other important considerations. Sustainability efforts with respect to our supply chain also address environmental impacts, while also emphasizing important issues such as appropriate agricultural labor practices and other components of industry-recognized GAP. 
Agricultural Labor Practices
Throughout the world, we work side-by-side with our contracted farmers to produce a sustainable tobacco crop that adheres to GAP, including appropriate agricultural labor practices. Our global Agricultural Labor Practices (“ALP”) program code, or ALP Code, consists of seven principles that set forth human rights requirements for our contracted farmers to meet. The ALP Code requires the progressive elimination of child labor; adherence to income and work hour requirements; fair treatment of workers so they are free from abuse; prohibition of forced labor; safe working environments; recognition and respect of workers’ rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining; and compliance with local employment laws. As part of our ALP program, we train contracted farmers on the ALP Code requirements and we monitor their compliance through multiple in-person farm visits during the growing season. The significant investment of time and resources we commit each year to our ALP program evidences the importance of sustainable labor practices to our business. 
Environmental Impacts
Universal is committed to abiding by environmental laws and regulations, monitoring our supply chain activities, and cooperating with supply chain partners to implement strategies that mitigate and reduce environmental impacts that may be associated with our business. We recognize three primary environmental risks related to our global footprint: water usage; emissions; and waste. In fiscal year 2020, several environmental projects and programs were expanded and implemented to further minimize our environmental footprint, including GAP program initiatives to address environmental risks on contracted farms. In addition, we publicly committed to meet a science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 30% for our Company by 2030 through the Science Based Targets Initiative.
For a discussion of recent developments and trends in our businesses, along with factors that may affect our businesses see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
C.    Human Capital Management
Workforce Overview 
We believe our employees are among our most important resources and rely on them to execute our business plan with integrity and efficiency. Investing in human capital is critical to our continued success. Our employees enable us to be a leading global supplier of leaf tobacco and other agri-products. We strive to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace; attract, retain, and develop talented personnel; and keep our employees safe and healthy.
As of March 31, 2022, we employed more than 25,000 employees, located in over 30 different countries across five continents. Approximately 55% of our employees are seasonal and approximately 45% of our employees are full time. More than 48% of our employees are female and almost 17% of our managers are female. Globally, Universal has twelve collective bargaining agreements in place, covering approximately 56% of our workforce. The sizeable seasonal nature of our global workforce makes these numbers fluctuate throughout the year. The above percentages reflect our workforce on March 31, 2022.
We are a multinational and multicultural organization, with employees and operations located around the world, and we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive workplace. Less than 6% of our employees are located in the United States. Almost all of our employees are from the same country in which our operations are located. Our expatriate hires represent less than 0.5% of our workforce, and they are hired due to their essential professional knowledge necessary to the operation of our business.
Universal Corporation’s Board of Directors’ Role in Human Capital Management
Our Board of Directors believes that human capital management is an important component of our continued growth and success and is essential to our ability to attract, retain, and develop talented and skilled employees. We pride ourselves on a culture that respects co-workers and values concern for others. 
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and our Compensation Committee both have important roles with respect to human capital management. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees and reviews our ESG programs, which include important policies and practices related to human rights, diversity and inclusion, prohibitions against discrimination, and other policies related to our workforce as well as our Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee has oversight of compensation, benefits, and retention and development processes, including an annual review of the Company's succession planning and leadership development program. 
We are committed to protecting the human rights of our employees and have policies in place to support this effort, including relating to whistleblowing, harassment, equal employment and compliance with local labor laws. Our Board of Directors also adopted our Code of Conduct and Anti-Corruption Compliance Manual to promote ethical behavior throughout the Company and address violations of ethical standards. The Code and Manual have been translated into 17 languages and apply directly to all officers, directors and non-seasonal employees in the Universal family of companies. The Board of Directors also adopted our Human Rights Policy, which defines the high ethical and social standards we implement across our global operations. We support these rights and programs through compliance communications, face-to-face and online training, and through an anonymous compliance hotline that we maintain globally. Our compliance hotline is available to all our employees and any other interested parties 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by internet or phone. The Board of Directors oversees our global compliance program and receives reports from our Chief Compliance Officer at each scheduled Board of Directors meeting. 
Employee Benefits
In addition to offering competitive base salaries and wages, the Compensation Committee believes employee benefits are an essential component of our total compensation package. Each of our global operations provides benefits that are designed to attract and retain our employees. These benefits vary depending on the location, seniority and employment status of our employees, and can include medical insurance, long-term disability insurance, retirement benefits, and similar programs. We periodically review and adjust our employees’ total compensation and benefits when necessary to ensure that they are competitive within our industry and are aligned with our performance.
We also support our employees outside of work through a variety of initiatives and strongly believe that our success relies on the prosperity of the communities in which we operate. We fund various programs that enhance local economies and cultures. For example, in numerous locations we support projects designed to impact our employees and their families such as establishing health clinics and wellness programs to assist our employees, administering after school care for schoolchildren, or funding local cultural events. Ultimately, we recognize our impact extends beyond the workplace and are proud to engage as both active corporate citizens and leaders in our neighborhoods, communities, and countries. 
Talent Development and Training
Employee training and development of both technical and leadership skills are integral aspects of our human capital strategy. We provide employees with a range of development opportunities that vary by location and seniority of employees, such as online training, live classes, and mentoring to assist with career advancement. These programs often include safety and technical job skill training as well as soft-skill programs focused on communication and change management. Development of leadership skills remains a top priority and is specialized for all level of employees. For example, members of management in our global operations participate in our succession planning programs, which include the identification of employees who are offered development opportunities for career advancement.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is at the forefront of our business efforts. We are committed to the prevention of injury and illness in the workplace through strong health and safety management, employee empowerment and accountability, and strict compliance with health and safety regulations. We pair our improved health and safety management system with a strong database reporting tool to allow all Universal facilities to track their local occupational health and safety performance and that of the entire company. These reports allow our global teams to analyze the insights collected from our health and safety system immediately.
Additionally, we utilize other health and safety initiatives to ensure our facilities remain safe for our employees. We established health and safety Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across our tobacco factory and agronomy operations. Each factory carries out an in-depth data analysis of prior data and implements KPIs for improvement and monitoring. By giving employees a goal to achieve and monitor, they will be more engaged in what they do and better able to help us succeed. Our “fresh eyes” approach to workplace safety involves inviting colleagues from different facilities to share in cross-auditing tasks. In addition to corporate audits, we encourage this regional cross-auditing to promote a collaborative framework and drive our employee safety programs forward.
We continue to closely monitor developments related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and have taken and continue to take steps intended to mitigate the potential risks to us. It is paramount that our employees who operate our businesses are safe and informed. We have assessed and regularly update our existing business continuity plans for our business in the context of this pandemic. For example, we have taken precautions with regard to employee and facility hygiene, imposed travel limitations on our employees, directed certain employee groups to work remotely whenever possible, and continue to assess protocols designed to protect our employees, customers, and the public.
D.    Research and Development 
We did not expend material amounts for research and development during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. 
E.    Intellectual Property 
We hold no material patents, licenses, franchises, or concessions. 
F.    Government Regulation, Environmental Matters, and Other Matters 
Our business is subject to general governmental regulation in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business. Such regulation includes, but is not limited to, matters relating to environmental protection. To date, governmental provisions regulating the discharge of material into the environment have not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of government regulations and other factors that may affect our business.
