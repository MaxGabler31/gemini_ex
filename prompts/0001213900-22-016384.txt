ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



We are a biotechnology company dedicated to developing treatments for certain medical conditions. Currently, two of our programs are focused on kidney disease that we believe have the potential to offer medical benefit. As we grow the Company and build our team, we intend to focus on identifying medical conditions within and outside of kidney disease. Our current development programs are focused on the development of two novel therapies: Renazorb, for treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, and UNI 494, for treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI). Renazorb and UNI 494 were initially developed by, and licensed to us from, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (“Spectrum”) and Sphaera Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Spectrum conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial with Renazorb in 2012 prior to the grant of our license in 2018. Sphaera conceived, and performed initial characterization of, various potential pro-drug linkers, including the initial patent application, and performed some initial physiochemical characterization and preliminary animal pharmacokinetic studies. As discussed herein, during 2020 and 2021 we have conducted preclinical studies with UNI 494.



Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the gradual loss of kidney function that can get worse over time leading to lasting damage. Our initial focus is on developing drugs and getting them approved in the US, and then to partner with global biopharmaceutical companies in the rest of the world. According to estimates by The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2019, 37 million (approximately 15%) adults in the United States have CKD and, of these, approximately 2 million patients have CKD stage 3-5, and around 500 thousand patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have hyperphosphatemia. In the European Union (EU), around 20 million (approximately 8%) adults have CKD, more than 1 million CKD stage 3-5 patients, and approximately 180 thousand patients with ESRD have hyperphosphatemia. The number of patients with ESRD in the US is increasing steadily and is projected to reach between 971,000 and 1,259,000 in 2030.



AKI is a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage (within the first 90 days of injury). After 90 days, the patient is considered to have progressed into CKD. AKI affects over 2 million U.S. patients and costs the healthcare system over $9 billion per year. AKI kills more than 300,000 patients per year in the U.S. and is caused by multiple etiologies.



Our business model is to license technologies and drugs, and pursue development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of those products in global markets. Many biotechnology companies utilize similar strategies of in-licensing and then developing and commercializing drugs. We believe, however, that our management team’s broad network, expertise in the biopharmaceutical industry, and successful track record gives us an advantage in identifying and bringing these assets into our Company at an attractive price with limited upfront cost.



Pipeline



Our proprietary pipeline is comprised of our two product candidates – Renazorb and UNI 494 – which are described below.

UNI-218 (Renazorb)



Disease overview: hyperphosphatemia



Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the gradual loss of kidney function that can get worse over time leading to lasting damage. The stages of chronic kidney disease are shown below in table 1.








Table 1: adapted from The Renal Association (https://renal.org/information-resources/the-uk-eckd-guide/ckd-stages/)



eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate (a measure of kidney function)



Complications of CKD include electrolyte imbalances, fluid build-up, anemia, bone disease, and heart disease. Hyperphosphatemia is an electrolyte disorder in which untreated elevated phosphate levels in the blood lead to cardiovascular complications and vascular calcification. According to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) guidelines, hyperphosphatemia is defined as an abnormally high serum phosphate concentration >1.46 mmol/L. In healthy people, phosphate levels are maintained as phosphate is absorbed from food and excreted in the urine and feces. In people with CKD, not enough phosphate is excreted, leading to elevated levels of phosphate in the blood. In CKD, hyperphosphatemia is caused by a chronic dysregulation of phosphates as a result of progressive kidney damage. According to a 2009 paper authored by Covic, hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and all-cause mortality. According to a study completed by Palmer in 2011, it is estimated that all-cause mortality is increased by 18% for every 1 mg/dL increase in serum phosphate concentration. Hyperphosphatemia is a major cause of morbidity in CKD patients, increasing the economic and clinical burden on patients and the health system.



According to Lederer in 2018, hyperphosphatemia occurs in at least 70% of patients with advanced (stage 5) CKD, which equates to approximately 500,000 patients. According to the 2019 National Chronic Kidney Disease Fact Sheet (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019), it is estimated that 15% of US adults (i.e. approximately 37 million people) have CKD. Furthermore, in a paper published by McCullough in 2019, the number of patients in the US with ESRD is increasing steadily and is projected to reach between 971,000 and 1,259,000 in 2030.

Current treatment of hyperphosphatemia



The treatment goal for patients with hyperphosphatemia is focused on controlling the level of phosphate in the body. Current Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, or KDIGO, guidelines recommend three main strategies for managing hyperphosphatemia: diet restrictions, phosphate binders, and dialysis, as shown in figure 1 below.








Figure 1: KDIGO guidelines recommend 3 main strategies.



While KDIGO guidelines support the treatment of hyperphosphatemia with phosphate binders in patients with CKD, they do not recommend one agent over another. Examples of different types of phosphate binders are shown in figure 2 below.








Figure 2: Phosphate Binders



This means that physicians prescribe their medication of choice, usually based on clinical and patient factors. In CKD patients on dialysis, hyperphosphatemia is most commonly treated with non-calcium phosphate binders.

The Unmet Medical Need for Treatment of Hyperphosphatemia



The mechanism of action and what we believe to be the advantages and disadvantages of various phosphate binders are shown below.








Table 2: Adapted from Covic and Rastogi, 2013.



In 2005, Unruh, ML published a paper that showed poor adherence to treatment is common in patients with ESRD and has been associated with an increased risk of mortality. In addition, poor adherence to phosphate binder therapy has been associated with failure to adequately control serum phosphorus concentrations as shown in a publication by Arenas, MD and others in 2010. Results from a study of 233 patients on maintenance dialysis from three different dialysis units in the US showed that patients took a mean of 11 ± 4 medications with a median daily pill intake of 19 as shown by Chiu, YW in 2009. Phosphate binders accounted for 49 ± 19% of the total pill burden, with a median pill count of 9. Only 38% of patients in this study were adherent to their prescribed phosphate binder therapy and adherence decreased significantly with increased pill count also shown by Chiu, YW in 2009 publication.



Potential strategies to improve adherence to phosphate binders in patients with ESRD include: (i) a reduction in pill size and number, (ii) improvement of palatability, and (iii) a reduction in associated adverse effects as published in a study by Covic and Rastogi in 2013.



Therefore, we believe there is a current need for better phosphate binders that have high and rapid phosphate binding, alongside a reduced pill burden for better medication compliance.



Background on Renazorb



Renazorb (lanthanum dioxycarbonate) is a second-generation phosphate binding agent utilizing proprietary nanoparticle technology for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients. In September 2012 a Phase 1 single-center clinical trial was completed in the United States with Renazorb studying 32 healthy volunteers. Four sequential dose cohorts of 8 subjects each (6 active and 2 placebo) received Renazorb at 1500, 3000, 4500, or 6000 mg/day, taken orally in 3 divided doses within 15 min after meals, for five consecutive days. The primary endpoint of the study was the evaluation of safety, and the secondary endpoint was the phosphate binding capacity of Renazorb as judged by the level of phosphorus in feces and urine. We believe the study indicated that Renazorb was minimally absorbed to the systemic circulation and was well-tolerated at doses up to 6000 mg/day. Renazorb significantly reduced urine phosphate excretion and significantly increased fecal phosphate excretion at doses at and above 3000 mg/day. The mean overall change in phosphorus from baseline in both urine and feces, across all treatment groups, showed a dose-response trend that was statistically significant (p<0.0001 and p=0.0004, respectively). The mean reduction in urine phosphorus excretion was not significant at 1500 mg/day (p=0.3676), but was significant at doses of 3000 (p=0.0004), 4500 (p<0.0001), and 6000 (p=0.0001) mg/day. The mean increase in fecal phosphorus excretion was significant at doses of 1500 (p=0.0358), 3000 (p=0.0006), 4500 (p=0.0026), and 6000 (p<0.0001) mg/day. The doses resulted in no serious adverse events (SAEs) and all patients completed the study.
Renazorb Purchase Agreement



On September 20, 2018, we entered into an Assignment and Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Renazorb Purchase Agreement”) with Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Spectrum”), pursuant to which we purchased certain assets from Spectrum, including Spectrum’s right, title, interest in and intellectual property related to Renazorb RZB 012, also known as RENALAN™ (“Renalan”) and RZB 014, also known as SPI 014 (“SPI” and together with Renalan, the “Compounds”). Pursuant to the Renazorb Purchase Agreement, in consideration for the Compounds, we issued 313,663 shares of common stock to Spectrum.

Additionally, the Renazorb Purchase Agreement provides that until the earlier of (i) 36 months from the first date on which our stock trades on a public market, or (ii) the date upon which we attain a public market capitalization of $50,000,000 or greater, we are required to issue additional shares of our common stock as may be needed to ensure Spectrum maintains a 4% ownership of our issued and outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis. Fully-diluted shares of common stock for purposes of the Renazorb Purchase Agreement assumes conversion of any security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock or any combination thereof, including any common stock reserved for issuance under a stock option plan, restricted stock plan, or other equity incentive plan approved by the Board of Directors of the Company immediately following the issuance of additional shares of our common stock (but prior to the issuance of any additional shares of common stock to Spectrum). We are also required to pay Spectrum 40% of all of our sublicense income for any sublicense granted to certain sublicensees during the first 12 months after the Closing Date (as that term is defined in the Renazorb Purchase Agreement) and 20% of all other sublicense income. Our payment obligations to Spectrum will expire on the twentieth (20th) anniversary of the Closing Date of the Renazorb Purchase Agreement.



Mechanism of Action



Renazorb binds to phosphates and forms an insoluble lanthanum phosphate complex which is then excreted via the feces. This results in reduction of serum phosphate levels.



In rat studies, Renazorb exhibited comparable binding kinetics compared to lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol). This was evident from comparable reduction in the phosphate level in urine of rats following administration of equivalent doses of lanthanum through Renazorb (i.e. LDC or lanthanum dioxycarbonate) vs lanthanum dioxycarbonate tetrahydrate (i.e, LCTH or Fosrenol) (see Fig 3).








Figure 3: Urine phosphate levels in rats following comparable lanthanum dosing through Renazorb (LDC) or Fosrenol (LCTH)



Animal studies to evaluate the potential efficacy of Renazorb versus sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel) in rats and dogs demonstrated significant lowering of phosphate levels in both urine and serum. In animal toxicology studies no unexpected toxicity was found and systemic absorption was extremely low that is consistent with Fosrenol.






-5-






The chemical design of Renazorb allows for smaller tablet size and fewer pills versus currently available phosphate binder alternatives, specifically with a dosing regimen of only one tablet per meal. The tablet is designed to disintegrate in the stomach after swallowing and disperse the product in a short period of time at a pH ≥3.0.



Clinical Trial Experience



In September 2012 a Phase 1 single-center clinical trial was completed in the United States with Renazorb studying 32 healthy volunteers. Four sequential dose cohorts of 8 subjects each (6 actives and 2 placeboes) received Renazorb at 1500, 3000, 4500, or 6000 mg/day, taken orally in 3 divided doses within 15 min after meals, for five consecutive days. The primary endpoint of the study was the evaluation of safety, and the secondary endpoint was the phosphate binding capacity of Renazorb as judged by the level of phosphorus in feces and urine.  We believe the study indicated that Renazorb was minimally absorbed to the systemic circulation and was well-tolerated at doses up to 6000 mg/day. Renazorb significantly reduced urine phosphate excretion and significantly increased fecal phosphate excretion at doses at and above 3000 mg/day.  The mean overall change in phosphorus from baseline in both urine and feces, across all treatment groups, showed a dose-response trend that was statistically significant (p<0.0001 and p=0.0004, respectively). The mean reduction in urine phosphorus excretion was not significant at 1500 mg/day (p=0.3676), but was significant at 3000 (p=0.0004), 4500 (p<0.0001), and 6000 (p=0.0001) mg/day, as shown in the figure below.







The mean increase in fecal phosphorus excretion was significant at 1500 (p=0.0358), 3000 (p=0.0006), 4500 (p=0.0026), and 6000 (p<0.0001) mg/day. The doses resulted in no serious adverse events (SAEs) and all patients completed the study.



Potential advantages of Renazorb



Renazorb is a phosphate binder for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD and is intended to be administered as a tablet that will be swallowed whole at mealtimes. CKD patients typically have co-morbidities, which often require them to be on strict pill schedules. Current phosphate binder products such as Fosrenol, Renagel/Renvela and Phoslo involve patients needing to take multiple and/or larger pills (on average, 9 pills/day), in addition to other, non-phosphate binder pills they sometimes need to take, resulting in poor adherence to the prescribed drug therapy (Figure 4 below). Lower molecular weight and no water of hydration with Renazorb as compared with Fosrenol allows Renazorb to be dosed in smaller mass. In this regard, we believe that the combined effect of smaller pill size, lower number of pills, and improved palatability with Renazorb versus currently available phosphate binders is likely to lead to improved patient compliance and more effective disease management.








Figure 4: Size comparisons of different phosphate binders



Market Potential



The worldwide market for hyperphosphatemia agents is estimated at ~$2.5 billion growing at a 5.3% CAGR (Fortune Business Insights, Hyperphosphatemia Treatment Market, 2021-2028). According to a study conducted by Syneos Health for the Company, based on the market data, the total US market makes up over $1 billion of the that total.



Based on the available data on overall efficacy, safety and compliance, we believe that Renazorb is well-positioned to become a product of choice in the multi-billion phosphate binder market.

Manufacturing



We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. If and when any of our product candidates are approved, we plan to obtain manufacturing capacity through contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to meet projected needs for commercial sale quantities and serve patient needs.



With regards to manufacturing, testing and potential commercial supply of Renazorb, we have entered into an agreement with Shilpa Medicare Ltd based in India. According to the terms of the agreement Unicycive will pay the vendor $2 million in the first calendar year when the net revenue reaches $10 million from sales of Renazorb following its approval by the FDA and commercial supply of the product by the vendor (First Payment). Thereafter, we will pay $2 million per year for four consecutive years, after the first year’s payment, for the total payments of $10 million, provided all commercial supplies are continued to be manufactured and supplied by the vendor. Unicycive is not obligated to make any payments to the vendor until FDA approval of the product is obtained and commercial revenue is generated.



Regulatory Strategy for Renazorb



Feedback from the FDA



We received additional guidance on the regulatory pathway for Renazorb from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following a Type C meeting in March 2022, in which the Agency confirmed that a single clinical bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers, together with the previously agreed-upon 6-month mouse toxicology study can support the New Drug Application (NDA) filing of Renazorb through a 505(b)(2) pathway.



We reached an agreement with the Agency on the clinical study design including the dose of Renazorb and Fosrenol, sample size and the primary endpoints of the bioequivalence study. The Agency confirmed that no additional clinical studies would be required for the NDA application.



BE Study Description



Based on guidance from the FDA, we are initiating a randomized, open label, two-way crossover BE study to establish pharmacodynamic bioequivalence between Renazorb and Fosrenol. The study will enroll 32 individuals per treatment sequence for a total of 64 evaluable subjects. An adequate number of subjects will be screened and randomized in order to get 64 evaluable subjects into the study. The primary endpoint of the study is LS mean change in urinary phosphate excretion from baseline to the evaluation period. The study will consist of a screening period, 2 dosing periods, a washout period, and a follow-up period. The study design is presented in the diagram below:








We believe that our continued collaborative interactions with the FDA will serve us well to be able to file our NDA. Activities in support of each of the requirements recommended by FDA are underway. We intend to hold additional discussions with FDA during the second half of 2022 to confirm their concurrence with our dataset and NDA submission strategy with the goal to file NDA by the end of 2022 or early 2023.



UNI 494



Disease overview: acute kidney injury (AKI)



Acute kidney injury (AKI) — a loose collection of syndromes characterized by a sudden decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) — is estimated to affect 2–3 people per 1,000 individuals in the United States as shown in a study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by Kellum, JA in 2012. AKI is a serious condition characterized by a sudden decline in kidney function that can lead to kidney failure. AKI, and CKD can form a continuum (see figure below) whereby initial kidney injury can lead to persistent renal injury, eventually leading to CKD as shown in a 2017 study published by Chawla, LS in Nature Reviews Nephrology.





-7-






AKI is defined as an abrupt decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days or less, whereas CKD is defined by the persistence of kidney disease for a period of >90 days. AKD describes acute or subacute damage and/or loss of kidney function for a duration of between 7 and 90 days after exposure to an AKI initiating event (Figure 6).







Figure 6: Adapted from Nature Review-Nephrology; Chawla LS et al. 2017



In the United States, approximately 1% of patients admitted to hospitals have AKI at the time of admission. The estimated incidence rate of AKI during hospitalization is 2-5%. AKI develops within 30 days postoperatively in approximately 1% of general surgery cases as shown in a paper by Kheterpal S in Journal Anesthesiology and arises in up to 67% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients as published in a paper by Goldberg R, 2008 in Advances in Chronic Kidney Disease. In recipients of solitary kidney transplants, 21% developed AKI within the first 6 months after transplantation as shown in a paper published by Panek R in 2016 in Clinical Transplantation.



In a prospective national cohort study that used an electronic AKI alert, the incidence of AKI was 577 per 100,000 population. Community-acquired AKI accounted for 49.3% of all incidence episodes, and 42% occurred in the context of pre-existing chronic kidney disease. The 90-day mortality rate was 25.6%, and 23.7% of episodes progressed to a higher AKI stage as published by Holmes J et al. in Clinical Journal of American Society of Nephrology in 2016.



The KDIGO criteria for AKI are shown below in Table 3. According to a study by Susantitaphong et al in 2013, using the KDIGO definition, an estimated 1 in 5 adults and 1 in 3 children worldwide experience AKI during a hospital episode of care.







Table 3: KDIGO criteria for AKI



The incidence of AKI varies among different patient populations and is shown below in Table 4. A 2018 study by Pavkov reported that the total number of hospitalizations with AKI increased from 953,926 in 2000 to 1,823,054 in 2006 and to 3,959,560 in 2014. Among persons with diabetes, AKI hospitalizations increased by 139%, from 23.1 to 55.3 per 1,000 persons and by 230% among persons without diabetes, from 3.5 to 11.7 per 1,000 persons (both p<0.001).





-8-






Hospital-acquired AKI is linked to 3 main areas: sepsis, procedures, and drug toxicity as shown below in Table 4.







Table 4: Adapted from Hoste et al. 2018



Current treatment of acute kidney injury



Treatment options for AKI include continuous renal replacement therapy, renal transplant, and dialysis. In a majority of cases the damage to the kidney is irreversible, and the patient needs to have a renal transplant or be on dialysis for life. There are no approved medicines to treat AKI; there is therefore a high unmet medical need. If approved, UNI 494 (a patented pro-drug of nicorandil) has the potential to be a first-in-class drug for the treatment of AKI.



Background on nicorandil



Nicorandil, marketed in such products as Ikorel and Dancor, is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris. It is not currently approved in the United States but has been approved for use in Australia, the United Kingdom and most of Europe, and in India, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Nicorandil is a dual-action potassium channel opener that relaxes vascular smooth muscle through membrane hyperpolarization via increased transmembrane potassium conductance and increased intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP). It is shown to dilate normal and stenotic coronary arteries and reduces both ventricular preload and afterload.



Nicorandil in acute kidney injury



The kidney has one of the highest mitochondrial densities in the body. Both acute and chronic kidney disease is associated with mitochondrial loss and impaired replacement, which subsequently results in increased oxidative damage and cellular injury. The diagram below in Figure 7 (Che R, 2014) shows how mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to kidney disease.





-9-










Figure 7: Che R, 2014: Mitochondria Dysfunction



Since mitochondrial dysfunction is an important factor in the pathogenesis of AKI, the mitochondria have emerged as a therapeutic target for treatment as published in a study by Ishimoto Y in 2016 in Journal Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation. In preclinical studies, nicorandil has been shown to improve mitochondrial function by blocking the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTP) and by stabilizing mitochondria against oxidative stress as published by Afzal, M in 2016 in Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology.



Figure 8 below shows the potential mechanisms of how nicorandil can improve mitochondrial function in renal disease.







Nicorandil has been reported to have a potential protective effect in the kidneys in nonclinical (Shiraishi 2014, Tamura 2012, Tanabe 2012) and human studies (Zhan 2018, Ma 2018). Further, no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of nicorandil have been observed in patients with normal renal function as compared to those with impaired renal function (Molinaro 1992).





-10-






In animal studies, nicorandil has demonstrated efficacy in multiple standard models of kidney disease (see Table 5). Notably, these effects occur in a blood pressure-independent manner, indicating that these beneficial effects are not simply a result of decreasing pressure-mediated kidney damage, but a direct beneficial effect on the kidney:







Table 5: Efficacy of nicorandil in standard models of kidney disease



Limitations of Nicorandil



Despite these promising results, development of nicorandil for use in acute kidney injury has not been successfully pursued to date. Nicorandil possesses at least two features that may limit its use in this clinical setting. First, nicorandil has a short half-life in humans of approximately 1 hour, which results in the need to dose nicorandil multiple times per day to achieve sustained blood levels.



Second, nicorandil is well tolerated by most patients, with less than 10% of patients reporting side-effects after 30 days of treatment, and roughly 70% remaining on nicorandil at one year. Similar to nitrates, headache is the most common side effect to nicorandil, occurring in roughly one third of patients. Other relatively common side effects are: dizziness, flushing, malaise and gastro-intestinal upset. However, nicorandil has been associated with rare but serious ulcerations in the gastrointestinal tract. The chance of this rare but potentially severe side effect increases with higher doses and long term use of this drug, and heals after drug withdrawal. A recent population-based study of this drug’s association with GI ulceration or perforation has been reported. This study, based on more than 600,000 randomly selected patients, found a 43% increase in the risk of GI ulceration and a 60% increase in the risk of GI perforation. This effect appears dose-dependent and limits the maximum labeled dose of nicorandil in Europe.



UNI 494: a Pro-drug of Nicorandil



UNI 494 is a patented pro-drug that was designed to be absorbed into the systemic circulation, and once absorbed, to release nicorandil into the bloodstream. By avoiding direct exposure to the gastrointestinal tract of nicorandil, it is believed that UNI 494 may be able to minimize or avoid the gastrointestinal side effects of nicorandil. Also, based on the rate of conversion of UNI 494 to nicorandil in the systemic circulation, UNI 494 may offer greater and/or more prolonged exposure to nicorandil for the treatment of patients with acute kidney injury. Our technology for UNI 494 is licensed from Sphaera Pharmaceutical Private Limited, a Singapore-based company (“Sphaera”), with offices in India and the US. We have the global, exclusive license to UNI 494. Sphaera conceived of and performed initial characterization of various potential pro-drug linkers, including the initial patent application, and performed some initial physiochemical characterization and preliminary animal pharmacokinetic studies.



In October 2020, we completed preclinical studies in rats and dogs demonstrating systemic exposure to nicorandil following oral dosing of UNI 494. In dogs, oral dosing of UNI 494 produced up to 4 times greater systemic exposure to nicorandil compared with literature data on equimolar doses of nicorandil itself.





-11-










We have selected rat and dog as the most suitable species for the GLP toxicology program for UNI 494, which we plan to commence in 2022.



Sphaera License Agreement



On October 1, 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “Sphaera License Agreement”) with Sphaera Pharma Pte. Ltd., a Singaporean pharmaceutical corporation (“Sphaera”). Pursuant to the Sphaera License Agreement, we acquired an exclusive royalty-bearing worldwide license to develop, make, have made, use, practice, research, distribute, lease, sell, offer for sale, license, import or otherwise dispose of certain rights owned or controlled by Sphaera and/or any of its affiliates, related to UNI 494 (the “UNI 494 Rights”). We also acquired a non-exclusive license to certain know-how and technology related to the UNI 494 Rights. Sphaera conceived of and performed initial characterization of various potential pro-drug linkers, including the initial patent application, and performed some initial physicochemical characterization and preliminary animal pharmacokinetic studies.



Under the terms of the Sphaera License Agreement, we are obligated to pay to Sphaera, on a quarterly basis, a running royalty of 2% of our net sales (including our affiliates) in connection with the sales of UNI 494; provided, however, that if we are required to make royalty payments to one or more third parties whose patent rights would be infringed by the exercise of the UNI 494 Rights, we may reduce such running royalty due to Sphaera by the amount of such third-party royalty rate.



We are also required to pay to Sphaera certain milestone payments, including, upon our initiation of a second clinical trial; $50,000 at the time the first patient in such trial is dosed; an additional $50,000 within 30 days of completion of such trial; and at the time the FDA accepts a New Drug Application for UNI494, $1.65 million. In addition, we are responsible for the prosecution of patent rights, and any related costs and expenses for patent prosecution and maintenance.



We also have the right, but not the obligation, to defend the UNI 494 rights during the term of the Sphaera License Agreement; provided, however, that if we determine not to prosecute or maintain such rights in any country, we must provide ninety (90) days written notice to Sphaera. We may terminate the Sphaera License Agreement at any time by providing thirty (30) days’ written notice to Sphaera. Additionally, in the event that either we or Sphaera breach any of our respective material obligations, the non-breaching party may, in its sole discretion, have the right to terminate the Sphaera License Agreement, provided that it give the breaching party written notice specifying the nature of the breach and amounts of running royalty payments due, if any. In such an occurrence, the termination notice is effective ninety (90) days from receipt of the notice if the breaching party has failed to cure the breach.

Clinical trials for UNI 494 in AKI



UNI 494 is currently in preclinical development. We plan to conduct repeat-dose animal toxicology studies and other IND-enabling preclinical studies in 2022 prior to initiating clinical development of UNI 494 in AKI.



It is challenging to conduct clinical trials in AKI trials due to the multiple etiologies of AKI. We believe that UNI 494 should be evaluated in clinical trials focusing on a few select etiologies in which UNI 494 has a very strong mechanistic rationale based on nicorandil clinical experience in terms of protection of kidney function and secondary benefits.



Based on our understanding of mechanism of action of the drug, we are in discussions with key opinion leaders (KOLs) to identify t the AKI subsets where UNI 494 can be most active and subsets of AKI patients who are most likely to benefit from UNI-494. We are planning to conduct preclinical studies in animal models to further explore the efficacy and development path in the AKI indication. We have also identified patient populations where we would not likely evaluate UNI 494 in clinical trials, including patients with prior history of gastrointestinal ulcerations. This will become exclusion criteria in future clinical trials for UNI 494.



Regulatory Strategy for UNI 494



Nicorandil is already approved in Europe and Asia for the treatment of heart disease. We believe there is a possibility these historical Nicorandil data, along with preclinical and clinical data with UNI 494 itself, can be utilized for streamlined US FDA review of UNI 494. While pre-clinical requirements to start a clinical program for an IND would be similar for UNI-494 as for NCE (New Chemical Entity). We believe that the vast clinical data set from Nicorandil will potentially help us to expedite the clinical development program with the FDA.



Market Potential



According to a 2017 article by Silver and Chertow, the current cost of care for AKI in the U.S. is estimated to be between $5.4 to $24 billion per year. In England, inpatient costs related to AKI are estimated to make up 1% of the total National Health Service budget. With no effective treatment for AKI, it is not possible to definitively state a market figure. However, with the high cost and burden of AKI, we believe a conservative market estimate is approximately $3 billion in the US alone. The lack of effective therapeutic interventions for AKI means that UNI 494 has the potential to be the first drug approved for the treatment of AKI. AKI is a heterogeneous disease. We plan to target a more homogeneous AKI population for UNI 494 by focusing on kidney injury caused by complications from heart failure, surgeries, drugs, and contrast induced nephropathy.
Competition



We operate in a highly competitive and regulated industry that is subject to rapid and frequent changes. We face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing products that would compete with the product candidates we are developing and the same or similar products that target the same conditions we intend to treat. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to compete successfully against these organizations, which include many large, well-financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies. 
Intellectual Property



Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, as well as novel discoveries, product development technologies, and know-how.



Our commercial success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to develop and maintain protection of our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and applications related to our technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business.



We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, confidentiality agreements, and invention assignment agreements to develop and maintain our proprietary position. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and the invention assignment agreements are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed for us by our employees, consultants, or other third parties. We seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in our agreements and security measures, either may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently discovered by competitors.

With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of using and manufacturing the same.



Renazorb Patent Portfolio 



Our Renazorb patent portfolio includes one family of granted United States patents, with related applications pending, and an additional family of granted foreign patents, with related applications also pending. Granted and pending claims offer various forms of protection for Renazorb including claims to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, specific forms (such as polymorphs of lanthanum dioxycarbonate), methods of making the composition of matter, and methods for treating elevated levels of phosphate in the blood using Renazorb. These United States patents and applications, and their foreign equivalents, are described in more detail below.



Both the U.S. patent family and the foreign patent family containing claims to Renazorb and related compounds were filed in 2011.  Exclusive of patent term extension, the U.S. patents from this family containing claims covering Renazorb has a statutory expiration date in 2031. Corresponding patents granted in Canada, Europe (validated in multiple European Patent Convention member states), Japan, China, Australia, and other countries have statutory expiration dates in 2031.



In some cases, granted United States patents claiming Renazorb have a longer statutory term than the corresponding foreign patents. This results from the USPTO’s practice of granting patent term adjustments for prosecution delays originating at the USPTO. Such adjustments are generally not available under foreign patent laws. If Renazorb is approved for marketing in the United States, under the Hatch-Waxman Act we may be eligible for up to five years patent term extension for a granted United States patent containing claims covering Renazorb. Similar term extensions may be available in Europe, Japan, Australia, and certain other foreign jurisdictions. The amount of any such term extension, and the identity of the patent to which it would apply, are dependent upon several factors including the duration of the development program and the date of marketing approval.



The most relevant granted United States patents with claims covering Renazob are listed below, along with their projected expiration dates exclusive of any patent term extension.




Patent Number | Title | Projected Expiration 
--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------
8,961,917 | Lanthanum carbonate hydroxide, lanthanum oxycarbonate and methods of their manufacture and use | May 12, 2031 
10,350,240 | Lanthanum carbonate hydroxide, lanthanum oxycarbonate and methods of their manufacture and use | May 12, 2031 

UNI 494



We believe that we have a strong global intellectual property position, substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to UNI 494. As of October 28, 2020, we have one granted U.S. patent that is exclusively licensed to us from Sphaera Pharma Pte Ltd. In addition, we have one application that we own. The granted U.S. patent is directed to methods of making UNI 494, and it is expected to expire in 2032. The PCT application is directed to methods of using UNI 494, and to other compositions of matter and their uses. Should U.S. and other global patents issue from this PCT application, they are expected to expire in 2040.

Government Regulations



Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, including the FDA, the FTC and the DEA, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we plan to develop and market. For both the products under development and to be marketed, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in suspension of regulatory approval and possible civil and criminal sanctions. Regulations, enforcement positions, statutes and legal interpretations applicable to the pharmaceutical industry are constantly evolving and are not always clear. Significant changes in regulations, enforcement positions, statutes and legal interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operations.



Additionally, future healthcare legislation or other legislative proposals at the federal and state levels could bring about major changes in the affected health care systems, including statutory restrictions on the means that can be employed by brand and generic pharmaceutical companies to settle Paragraph IV patent litigations. We cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives, but such initiatives, if passed, could result in significant costs to us in terms of costs of compliance and penalties associated with failure to comply.



Pharmaceutical Regulation in the United States



In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, Warning Letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution of product(s), injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.



FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug or a generic version of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States.



The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:




● | Completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s current GLP regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approval by an IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of a pre-approval inspection by FDA of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies



When developing a branded product and bringing it to market, the first step in proceeding to clinical studies is preclinical testing. Preclinical tests are intended to provide a laboratory or animal study evaluation of the product to determine its chemistry, formulation and stability. Toxicology studies are also performed to assess the potential safety of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application along with other information, including product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue concurrently with the IND application.
Clinical Trials



Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it is initiated at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.



Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may be distinct, or overlap or be combined:




● | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition, and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if it is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.



Marketing Approval



After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include, among other things, the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer or sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit its substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In some events, the NDA may be required to be resubmitted with the additional information and it may be subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals for itself for the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over existing therapies. The FDA endeavors to review most applications subject to Standard Review within ten to twelve months whereas its goal is to complete most Priority Review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity.





-16-






The FDA may refer applications for certain drug products which present difficult questions related to its safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation, and to seek advice as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the NDA unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications, and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective for the labeled indication.



After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.



As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.



Sometimes, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or certain problems are identified following initial marketing. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms.



Further changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the similar procedures in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing the original NDAs.



Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information

  
Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, subject population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss certain results of their clinical trials after its completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.





-17-






Post-Approval Requirements



Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting, and advertising, marketing and promotion, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may choose to prescribe a drug for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote it for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. There also are extensive DEA regulations applicable to controlled substances.



Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is also required following FDA approval of an NDA. Additionally, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and/or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Alternatively, the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to comply with cGMPs after its approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their marketed products with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. In addition, regulatory authorities may take other enforcement action, including, among other things, Warning Letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.



The Hatch-Waxman Amendments



505(b)(2) NDAs



The FDA is also authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference from the data owner. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product that acts as the “listed drug.” The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the listed drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the conditions of use for which the branded reference drug has been approved, or for a new condition of use sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications



The Hatch-Waxman amendments to the FDCA established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of ANDAs for generic versions of listed drugs. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the API, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. However, a generic manufacturer is typically required to conduct bioequivalence studies of its test product against the listed drug. The bioequivalence studies for orally administered, systemically available drug products assess the rate and extent to which the API is absorbed into the bloodstream from the drug product and becomes available at the site of action. Bioequivalence is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent for absorption of the generic product and the reference listed drug. For some drugs, other means of demonstrating bioequivalence may be required by the FDA, especially where rate or extent of absorption are difficult or impossible to measure. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the reference listed drug. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not bioequivalent to the reference listed drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to, and requires, an approved Suitability Petition.





-18-






Orange Book Listing



In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA (i) that there is no patent listed with the FDA as covering the relevant branded product, (ii) that any patent listed as covering the branded product has expired, (iii) that the patent listed as covering the branded product will expire prior to the marketing of the generic product, in which case the ANDA will not be finally approved by the FDA until the expiration of such patent or (iv) that any patent listed as covering the branded drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of the generic product for which the ANDA is submitted. A notice of the Paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.



If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.



Non-Patent Exclusivity



In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug.



For example, for listed drugs that were considered new chemical entities at the time of approval, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application referencing that drug may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years after approval of that drug, unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.



A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. In addition, drugs approved for diseases for which the patient population is sufficiently small, or orphan indications, are entitled to a seven-year data exclusivity period.



Pricing and Reimbursement



Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of governmental and third-party payor reimbursement for the cost of our products. Government authorities and third-party payors increasingly are challenging the price of medical products and services. On the government side, there is a heightened focus, at both the federal and state levels, on decreasing costs and reimbursement rates for Medicaid, Medicare and other government insurance programs. This has led to an increase in federal and state legislative initiatives related to drug prices, which could significantly influence the purchase of pharmaceutical products, resulting in lower prices and changes in product demand. If enacted, these changes could lead to reduced payments to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Many states have also created preferred drug lists and include drugs on those lists only when the manufacturers agree to pay a supplemental rebate. If our current products or future product candidates are not included on these preferred drug lists, physicians may not be inclined to prescribe them to their Medicaid patients, thereby diminishing the potential market for our products.





-19-






In addition, third-party payors have been imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for pharmaceutical products. Third-party payors may require manufacturers to provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and limit coverage to specific pharmaceutical products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved pharmaceutical products for particular indications. Third-party payors may challenge the price and examine the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products in addition to their safety and efficacy. Manufacturers may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable manufacturers to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on their investment in drug development.



Healthcare Reform



In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last several years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the United States. It is uncertain what other legislative proposals may be adopted or what actions federal, state, or private payors may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. We cannot predict the effect such reforms may have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect.



By way of example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), was signed into law, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. The law includes measures that (i) significantly increase Medicaid rebates through both the expansion of the program and significant increases in rebates, (ii) substantially expand the Public Health System (340B) program to allow other entities to purchase prescription drugs at substantial discounts, (iii) extend the Medicaid rebate rate to a significant portion of Managed Medicaid enrollees, (iv) assess a rebate on Medicaid Part D spending in the coverage gap for branded and authorized generic prescription drugs, and (v) levy a significant excise tax on the industry to fund the healthcare reform.



In addition to the changes brought about by the ACA, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective. There can be no assurance that Congress or the Biden Administration intend to provide for such authorizations.



The Biden administration has also undertaken other actions – and may continue to do so – signaling a change in policy from the prior Trump administration. Such activities include Executive Order 13992, revoking several Trump administration orders that had certain deregulatory effects, and a letter to the United Nations retracting the United States’ intent to withdraw from the World Health Organization. Other actions by the Biden administration and/or legislation passed by the new Congress could further impact the pharmaceutical and broader healthcare industries in ways that are difficult to predict but that could also materially impact our operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare reforms will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation, executive action or regulation and, accordingly, face uncertainties that might result from additional reforms.





-20-






At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.



Healthcare Regulations



Pharmaceutical companies are subject to various federal and state laws that are intended to combat health care fraud and abuse and that govern certain of our business practices, especially our interactions with third-party payors, healthcare providers, patients, customers and potential customers through sales and marketing or research and development activities. These include anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, sunshine laws, privacy laws and FDA regulation of advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products.



Anti-kickback laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, make it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce or reward referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service reimbursable by, a federal health care program (including our products). The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. The penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include administrative civil money penalties, imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $25,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.



The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent (and, under the Federal False Claims Act, a claim is deemed false or fraudulent if it is made pursuant to an illegal kickback). Manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in significant monetary penalties, including fines ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other improper sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, companies have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.



The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance can result in civil money penalties of up to $15,270 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.



Federal criminal statutes prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to products and services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including commercial payors. Additionally, there are state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers as well as state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report marketing expenditures or pricing information.



Sunshine laws, including the Federal Open Payments law enacted as part of the ACA, require pharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value to physicians and certain other health care providers or professionals, and in the case of some state sunshine laws, restrict or prohibit certain such payments. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.105 million per year for “knowing failures”) for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Certain states and foreign governments require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.



Privacy laws, such as the privacy regulations implemented under HIPAA, restrict covered entities from using or disclosing protected health information. Covered entities commonly include physicians, hospitals and health insurers from which we may seek to acquire data to aid in our research, development, sales and marketing activities. Although pharmaceutical manufacturers are not covered entities under HIPAA, our ability to acquire or use protected health information from covered entities may be affected by privacy laws. Specifically, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.



The FDA regulates the sale and marketing of prescription drug products and, among other things, prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers from making false or misleading statements and from promoting products for unapproved uses. There has been an increase in government enforcement efforts at both the federal and state level. Numerous cases have been brought against pharmaceutical manufacturers under the Federal False Claims Act, alleging, among other things, that certain sales or marketing-related practices violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or the FDA’s regulations, and many of these cases have resulted in settlement agreements under which the companies were required to change certain practices, pay substantial fines and operate under the supervision of a federally appointed monitor for a period of years. Due to the breadth of these laws and their implementing regulations and the absence of guidance in some cases, it is possible that our practices might be challenged by government authorities. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by civil and criminal sanctions including fines, civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion of our products from payment by federal health care programs.



Government Price Reporting



Government regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations are complex, and we are continually evaluating the methods we use to calculate and report the amounts owed with respect to Medicaid and other government pricing programs. Our calculations are subject to review and challenge by various government agencies and authorities, and it is possible that any such review could result either in material changes to the method used for calculating the amounts owed to such agency or the amounts themselves. Because the process for making these calculations, and our judgments supporting these calculations, involve subjective decisions, these calculations are subject to audit. In the event that a government authority challenges or finds ambiguity with regard to our report of payments, such authority may impose civil and criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. From time to time we conduct routine reviews of our government pricing calculations. These reviews may have an impact on government price reporting and rebate calculations used to comply with various government regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations.



Many governments and third-party payors reimburse the purchase of certain prescription drugs based on a drug’s AWP. In the past several years, state and federal government agencies have conducted ongoing investigations of manufacturers’ reporting practices with respect to AWP, which they have suggested have led to excessive payments by state and federal government agencies for prescription drugs. We and numerous other pharmaceutical companies have been named as defendants in various state and federal court actions alleging improper or fraudulent practices related to the reporting of AWP.

Drug Pedigree Laws



State and federal governments have proposed or passed various drug pedigree laws which can require the tracking of all transactions involving prescription drugs from the manufacturer to the pharmacy (or other dispensing) level. Companies are required to maintain records documenting the chain of custody of prescription drug products beginning with the purchase of such products from the manufacturer. Compliance with these pedigree laws requires implementation of extensive tracking systems as well as heightened documentation and coordination with customers and manufacturers. While we fully intend to comply with these laws, there is uncertainty about future changes in legislation and government enforcement of these laws. Failure to comply could result in fines or penalties, as well as loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Federal Regulation of Patent Litigation Settlements and Authorized Generic Arrangements



As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, companies are required to file with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the settlement of patent litigation or manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs. This requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with brand pharmaceutical companies and could result generally in an increase in private-party litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the FTC or other governmental authorities.
Other



The U.S. federal government, various states and localities have laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals, as well as regulations dealing with the substitution of generic drugs for branded drugs. Our operations are also subject to regulation, licensing requirements and inspection by the states and localities in which our operations are located or in which we conduct business.



Certain of our activities are also subject to FTC enforcement actions. The FTC also enforces a variety of antitrust and consumer protection laws designed to ensure that the nation’s markets function competitively, are vigorous, efficient and free of undue restrictions. Federal, state, local and foreign laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, also govern us.



In addition, we are subject to numerous and increasingly stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and the cleanup of contamination. We are required to maintain and comply with environmental permits and controls for some of our operations, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. Our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or increased manufacturing activities at any of our facilities. We could incur significant costs or liabilities as a result of any failure to comply with environmental laws, including fines, penalties, third-party claims and the costs of undertaking a clean-up at a current or former site or at a site to which our wastes were transported. In addition, we have grown in part by acquisition, and our diligence may not have identified environmental impacts from historical operations at sites we have acquired in the past or may acquire in the future.
