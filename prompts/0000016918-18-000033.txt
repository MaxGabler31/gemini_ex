Item 1. Business.
Introduction
We are an international producer and marketer of beer, wine and spirits with operations in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, Italy and Canada and more than 100 brands in our portfolio. In the U.S., we are the largest multi-category supplier (beer, wine and spirits) (“Multi-category Supplier”) of beverage alcohol. We are the third-largest beer company in the U.S. market and the world’s leading premium wine company. Many of our products are recognized as leaders in their respective categories. This, combined with our strong market positions, makes us a supplier of choice to many of our customers, who include wholesale distributors, retailers and on-premise locations.
Our vision is to elevate life with every glass raised and our mission is to build brands that people love. We are committed to brand building, our trade partners, the environment, our investors and to consumers around the world who choose our products when celebrating big moments or enjoying quiet ones.
Our key values are:

• | people;


• | customer focus;


• | entrepreneurship;


• | quality; and


• | integrity.

The Company is a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 4, 1972, as the successor to a business founded in 1945. We have approximately 9,600 employees located primarily in the U.S. and Mexico, with our corporate headquarters located in Victor, New York. We conduct our business through entities we wholly own as well as through a variety of joint ventures and other entities.
Strategy
Our overall strategy is to create industry-leading growth and shareholder value by building premium brands that people love. We position our portfolio to benefit from industry premiumization trends, which we believe will continue to result in faster growth rates in the high-end of the beer, wine and spirits categories.
Certain key U.S. industry trends include:

• | high-end beer (led by imported, craft and domestic super premium) growing faster than total beer;


• | growth in U.S. per capita consumption of wine and spirits and volume of premium and above wine and spirits growing faster than value-priced wine and spirits; and


• | consolidation of suppliers, wholesalers and retailers.

To capitalize on these trends, become more competitive and grow our business, we have generally employed a strategy focused on a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, with an increasing focus on the higher-growth, higher-margin premium and above categories of the beverage alcohol industry. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | leveraging our leading position in total beverage alcohol and our scale with wholesalers and retailers to expand distribution of our product portfolio and cross promotional opportunities;


• | strengthening relationships with wholesalers and retailers by providing consumer and beverage alcohol insights;


• | investing in brand building activities;


• | positioning ourselves for success with consumer-led innovation capabilities that identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics;


• | realizing operating efficiencies through expanding and enhancing production capabilities and maximizing asset utilization; and


• | developing employees to enhance performance in the marketplace.

In the beer business, we completed the acquisition of the imported beer business in June 2013, which solidified our position in the U.S. beer market over the long-term; diversified our profit base and enhanced our margins, results of operations and operating cash flow; and provided new avenues for growth. Since completing this transformational acquisition, we have made capital investments and acquisitions to increase beer production capacity to secure independence from a supply standpoint and to support the growth of the business. We enhanced our position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market with the acquisition of Ballast Point, a highly-awarded craft brewer, which provided us with a premium platform to compete in the growing craft beer category.
In our wine and spirits business, we have acquired higher-growth, higher-margin premium and above wine brands including Meiomi, Prisoner and Charles Smith wine brands, and divested the lower-margin Canadian wine business, as part of our efforts to increase our mix of premium and above brands, improve margins and create operating efficiencies. In addition, we have added high-end brands to our spirits portfolio through the acquisitions of Casa Noble and High West.
For further information on our strategy, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“MD&A”).

Business Segments
We report our operating results in three segments: (i)  Beer, (ii)  Wine and Spirits, and (iii)  Corporate Operations and Other. The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management and the structure of our internal financial reporting. We report net sales in two reportable segments, as follows:

Consolidated Net Sales | $ | 7,585.0 | | | | | $ | 7,331.5 | | | | | $ | 6,548.4 | | | 

Beer Segment
We are the leader in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market. We sell a number of brands in the imported and craft beer categories.
Within the imported beer category, we have the exclusive right to import, market and sell these Mexican beer brands in all 50 states of the U.S.:

• | Corona Extra


• | Corona Light


• | Modelo Especial


• | Modelo Negra


• | Modelo Chelada


• | Pacifico


• | Victoria

In the U.S., we are the leading imported beer company and have six of the 15 top-selling imported beer brands. Corona Extra is the best-selling imported beer and the fifth best-selling beer overall in the U.S.; Corona Light is the leading imported light beer; and Modelo Especial is the second-largest and the fastest-growing major imported beer brand.
3

Since the acquisition of the imported beer business, we have increased our production capacity in Mexico from 10 million to approximately 31.5 million hectoliters. Our current production capacity provides us the opportunity to further expand our leadership position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market by increasing our investment behind on-trend innovation. As part of these efforts, we’re launching Corona Premier, a lower-calorie, lower-carbohydrate offering in the high-end U.S. beer market segment. Additionally, we are continuing efforts focused on increasing sales penetration of products in can, draft and larger package size formats.
Expansion and construction efforts continue under our Mexico Beer Expansion Projects. Since the acquisition of the imported beer business, we have invested approximately $2.9 billion for the Mexico Beer Expansion Projects, with approximately $800 million during Fiscal 2018. To align with our anticipated future growth expectations, we’re targeting an additional 12.5 million hectoliters of production capacity expansion activities to be completed over the next five fiscal years.
Prior to the acquisition of the imported beer business, we and Modelo, indirectly, each had an equal interest in Crown Imports LLC, which had the exclusive right to import, market and sell primarily Modelo’s Mexican beer portfolio in the U.S. as of the date of the acquisition.
Our craft beer products are primarily sold under the Ballast Point brand. Ballast Point is led by its popular Sculpin IPA and has excellent innovation capabilities. The Funky Buddha acquisition allows us to leverage our craft beer platform, capitalizing on the growth of high-quality, regional craft beer brands.
Wine and Spirits Segment
We are the world’s leading premium wine company. We sell a large number of wine brands across all categories – table wine, sparkling wine and dessert wine – and across all price points – popular, premium and luxury categories, primarily within the $5 to $25 price range at U.S. retail – and we have a leading market position in the U.S. Our wine portfolio is supported by grapes purchased from independent growers, primarily in the U.S., New Zealand and Chile, and vineyard holdings in the U.S., New Zealand and Italy.
Our wine produced in the U.S., New Zealand and Italy is primarily marketed in the U.S. In addition, we export our wine products to Canada and other major world markets.
In our spirits business, SVEDKA Vodka is imported from Sweden and is the largest imported vodka brand in the U.S. Black Velvet Canadian Whisky is the second-largest Canadian whisky brand in the U.S. Our high-end spirits brands include Casa Noble tequila and High West craft whiskeys.
In the U.S., we sell 19 of the 100 top-selling wine brands and are a leading premium wine company. Some of our well-known wine and spirits brands sold in the U.S., which comprised our Fiscal 2018 U.S. Focus Brands (“Focus Brands”), included:

Wine Brands | | Spirits Brands 
7 Moons | Kung Fu Girl | Robert Mondavi | Casa Noble 
Black Box | Mark West | Ruffino | High West 
Clos du Bois | Meiomi | Simi | SVEDKA Vodka
Estancia | Mount Veeder | The Dreaming Tree | 
Franciscan Estate | Nobilo | The Prisoner | 
Kim Crawford | Ravage | The Velvet Devil | 

We dedicate a large share of sales and marketing resources to our Focus Brands as they represent a majority of our U.S. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and generally have strong positions in their respective price categories.
4

We have been increasing resources in support of on-trend product innovation as we believe this is one of the key drivers of overall beverage alcohol category growth. In wine, we have launched varietal line extensions behind many of our Focus Brands, such as Bourbon Barrel Aged Robert Mondavi Private Selection and Meiomi Rosé, and we have introduced newer brands like Derange, 7 Moons and Cooper & Thief. In spirits, we are leveraging our existing brand equity established with Black Box Wines with the introduction of Black Box Spirits, initially offered in whiskey, tequila and vodka formats.
In addition, as part of our efforts to increase focus on higher-growth, higher-margin premium and above brands, we continue to rationalize lower-growth, lower-margin products mostly within the popular price category.
Corporate Operations and Other
The Corporate Operations and Other segment includes traditional corporate-related items including executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations and information technology.
Further information regarding net sales, operating income and total assets of each of our business segments and information regarding geographic areas is set forth in Note 21 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Marketing and Distribution
To focus on their respective product categories, build brand equity and increase sales, our segments employ full-time, in-house marketing, sales and customer service functions. These functions engage in a range of marketing activities and strategies, including market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, on-premise promotions and public relations. Where opportunities exist, particularly with national accounts in the U.S., we leverage our sales and marketing skills across the organization.
In the U.S., our products are primarily distributed by wholesale distributors, with separate distribution networks utilized for (i)  our beer portfolio and (ii)  our wine and spirits portfolio, as well as state alcohol beverage control agencies. As is the case with all other beverage alcohol companies, products sold through these agencies are subject to obtaining and maintaining listings to sell our products in that agency’s state. State governments can affect prices paid by consumers of our products through the imposition of taxes or, in states in which the government acts as the distributor of our products through an alcohol beverage control agency, by directly setting the retail prices.
Trademarks and Distribution Agreements
Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell products under a number of trademarks, which we own or use under license. Throughout our segments, we also have various licenses and distribution agreements for the sale, or the production and sale, of our products and products of third parties. These licenses and distribution agreements have varying terms and durations.
Within the Beer segment, we have an exclusive sub-license to use trademarks related to our Mexican beer brands in the U.S. This sub-license agreement is perpetual. Prior to our acquisition of the imported beer business, Crown Imports had exclusive importation agreements with the suppliers of certain imported beer products and had an exclusive renewable sub-license to use certain trademarks related to the imported beer brands in the U.S.

Competition
The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength. Our beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, some of which have greater resources than we do. Our principal competitors include:

Beer | Anheuser-Busch InBev, Molson Coors, Heineken, Pabst Brewing Company, The Boston Beer Company 
Wine | E&J Gallo Winery, The Wine Group, Trinchero Family Estates, Treasury Wine Estates, Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, Deutsch Family Wine & Spirits, Jackson Family Wines
Spirits | Diageo, Beam Suntory, Brown-Forman, Sazerac Company, Pernod Ricard 

Production
Our current production capacity in Mexico at our Nava and Obregon breweries is approximately 31.5 million hectoliters. Prior to the acquisition of the Obregon Brewery, we entered into a three-year interim supply agreement with Modelo in June 2013, which was initially extended for one additional year through June 2017. However, the purchase of the Obregon Brewery enabled us to become fully independent from this interim supply agreement, which was terminated at the time of this acquisition. In addition, we are constructing the Mexicali Brewery, located near California, which is our largest imported beer market in the U.S. Based on our anticipated future growth expectations, we intend to expand our production capacity in Mexico to approximately 44 million hectoliters over the next five fiscal years.
Our craft beer production requirements are primarily fulfilled by our Miramar and Daleville facilities, located in the greater San Diego, California, and Roanoke, Virginia, areas, respectively. These facilities can be expanded to accommodate future growth. We also operate multiple tap rooms with smaller scale production and innovation capabilities.
In the U.S., we operate 18 wineries using many varieties of grapes grown principally in the Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and San Joaquin regions of California. We also operate three wineries in New Zealand and five wineries in Italy. Grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk. The inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each year’s grape harvest, and are reduced prior to the subsequent year’s crush. Wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in September through November in the U.S. and Italy, and in March through May in New Zealand.
Our Canadian whisky requirements are produced and aged at our Canadian distillery in Lethbridge, Alberta. We currently operate two facilities in the U.S. for the production of our High West whiskey brand. The requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of our spirits are purchased from various suppliers.
Certain of our wines and spirits must be aged for more than one year up to multiple years. Therefore, our inventories of wines and spirits may be larger in relation to sales and total assets than in many other businesses.
Sources and Availability of Production Materials
The principal components in the production of our Mexican and craft beer brands include water; agricultural products, such as yeast and grains; and packaging materials, which include glass, aluminum and cardboard.
For our Mexican beer brands, packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production, with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials. For Fiscal 2018, the package format mix of our Mexican beer volume sold in the U.S. was 70% glass bottles, 27% aluminum cans and 3% in stainless steel kegs.

The Nava and Obregon breweries receive water originating from aquifers. We believe we have adequate access to water to support the breweries’ on-going requirements, as well as future requirements after the completion of planned expansion activities.
As part of our efforts to solidify our beer glass sourcing strategy over the long-term, we formed an equally-owned joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world’s largest glass container manufacturer. The joint venture acquired a state-of-the-art glass production plant that is located adjacent to our Nava Brewery in Mexico, in December 2014. The glass plant currently has four operational glass furnaces and the joint venture intends to increase it to five furnaces by the end of calendar 2019. When fully operational with five furnaces, the glass plant is expected to supply approximately 60% – 65% of our glass requirements for the Nava Brewery. We also have long-term glass supply agreements with other glass producers.
The principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products, such as grapes and grain, and packaging materials (primarily glass).
Most of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each year’s harvest which normally begins in August and runs through October in the U.S. and Italy, and begins in February and runs through May in New Zealand. We receive grapes from approximately 910 independent growers in the U.S. and approximately 170 independent growers located primarily in New Zealand and Chile. We enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies year-to-year and is largely based on then-current market prices.
As of February 28, 2018, we owned or leased approximately 21,300 acres of land and vineyards, either fully bearing or under development, in the U.S., New Zealand and Italy. This acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production. However, most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of certain of our higher-end wines. We continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards, and additional land for vineyard plantings, to supplement our grape supply.
We believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations. However, when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations, we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the world.
The distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products, neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market. We believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time.
We utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) bottles and other materials such as caps, corks, capsules, labels, wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products. After grape purchases, glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold. In the U.S., the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers. We have traditionally obtained, and continue to obtain, our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under long-term supply arrangements. Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations. We have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this time.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a range of laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Where we produce products, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and may be required to obtain environmental and alcohol beverage permits and licenses to operate our facilities. Where we market and sell products, we may be subject to laws and regulations on brand registration, packaging and labeling, distribution methods and relationships, pricing and price changes, sales promotions, advertising and public relations. We are also subject to rules and regulations relating to changes in officers or directors, ownership or control.
7

We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We also believe that the cost of administration and compliance with, and liability under, such laws and regulations does not have, and is not expected to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Seasonality
The beverage alcohol industry is subject to seasonality in each major category. As a result, in response to wholesaler and retailer demand which precedes consumer purchases, our beer sales are typically highest during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, which correspond to the Spring and Summer periods in the U.S. Our wine and spirits sales are typically highest during the third quarter of our fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying.
Employees
As of February 28, 2018, we had approximately 9,600 employees. Approximately 4,800 employees were in the U.S. and approximately 4,800 employees were outside of the U.S., primarily in Mexico. We may employ additional workers during the grape crushing seasons. Approximately 23% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. There are no collective bargaining agreements expiring within one year. We consider our employee relations generally to be good.
