Our Corporate History and Background
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7, 2008. From inception through December 31, 2014, our primary business purpose was to stockpile indium, a specialty metal that is used as a raw material in a wide variety of consumer electronics manufacturing applications. As of December 31, 2014, we sold all the indium from our stockpile. As a result, at such time we were no longer in the business of purchasing and selling indium. In 2015, our Board of Directors approved a cash distribution to our stockholders and a share repurchase program. After completion of the cash distribution and the share repurchase program the Company sought a new growth platform and focused on its current strategy of acquiring and growing operating businesses.
Domestic Industry Overview by Business line
Transportation Services Business
Heavy Haul
A heavy haul or oversize load is a load that exceeds the standard or ordinary legal size and/or weight limits for a truck to convey on a specified portion of road, highway, or other transport infrastructure. Also, a load that exceeds the 

2



per-axle limits, but not the overall weight limits, is considered overweight. Examples of oversize/overweight loads include construction machines (cranes, front loaders, backhoes, etc.), wind energy components such as blades, production equipment used in energy, midstream natural gas compressors, pre-built homes, power generation components, containers, and infrastructure elements (such as bridge beams and industrial equipment).
Super Heavy Haul
A super heavy haul is a permit-required over-dimensional load that typically exceeds 254 thousand pounds gross vehicle weight and requires specialized equipment. Examples of this type of load include refinery components, boilers, slug catchers, vessels, large natural gas compressors, large wind components for renewable energy, and transformers for the power industry.
Drilling Rig Mobilization
Moving a drilling rig involves mobilization of the rig’s substructure, derrick, power generation and mud and pumping equipment, and drill pipe. Typically, jobs are quoted in ten-mile increments with most mobilizations within a one-hundred mile radius. These moves can include cold stack rigs coming out of storage into the field.
Commodity Freight
Legal loads not requiring permits that include mining and drilling equipment, lumber, pipe, heavy equipment, heavy machinery, coil tubing, steel, solar panels, and generators.
Freight Brokerage
Brokerage services are utilized when an existing, or new customer has logistics needs that exceed our current scope of services or equipment and we arrange for a carrier on their behalf. This service line was recently integrated in-house in lieu of outsourcing brokerage services to a third party to raise the value to our customers.
Company Strategies
Buy and Build for Company Growth
Our strategy involves growth resulting from making acquisitions of private lower or middle-market size transportation services and related businesses operating in the domestic United States with a plan to grow an acquired company post-acquisition. Our management team seeks to identify companies that have good reputations and customers, and complementary service lines. We plan for additional growth, post-acquisition, of these targets by identifying business constraints which can be removed once acquired by us. These business constraints typically can be a lack of equipment, working capital, systems, sales force or MSAs and customer agreements. This strategy differs, in management’s view, from a “roll-up” as we do not make acquisitions just for cost saving synergies from elimination of duplicate personnel, consolidation of facilities, etc., but rather by adding personnel, capital and customers for anticipated future growth.
The acquisition of 5J in February 2020 added heavy haul, super heavy haul, drilling rig mobilization and commodity freight to our lines of service.
Diversify Existing Service Offerings
Our strategy of developing or adding additional lines of service such as heavy haul of bridge beams and wind energy components will diversify our business and provide enhanced service offerings to our customers. In addition, we have recently formed a transportation brokerage subsidiary in Fort Mill, South Carolina with operations throughout the domestic United States that further diversifies our business and customer base. Given the volatility of hydrocarbon prices and its affect on upstream oil and gas (“O&G”) customer activity, this diversification strategy assists in the drilling rig mobilization services which was a legacy offering of the Company. Strategically, we have pivoted over the last few years in an attempt to reduce concentration in the oil and gas markets by focusing on the infrastructure business of hauling bridge

beams, wind energy components and power transformers. We believe we will likely continue to have exposure in the upstream O&G market given the geography and customers we serve, and as such, our strategy is to reduce the overall percentage to a minority share of our total business.
Add Owner Operator Trucking Companies to Enhance Transportation Business
For independent trucking company fleets with less than 100 tractors, it can be customary to ‘lease on’ with a larger transportation firms benefitting from their back-office infrastructure, insurance policies and access to additional ancillary equipment. 5J has historically sought a balance between company owned drivers and equipment and owner/operators who have leased on to 5J’s operating authority. We have enhanced our fleet with approximately 100 tractors through several owner operators that have lease on. Our revenue share lease allows our owner/operators to operate more efficiently, and we do not have to carry their assets and fixed overhead creating a balance for our transportation business.
Expand Service Offerings within Existing Customers
We currently have over 600 customers, many of which are leading companies in their respective fields. Our strategy is to deepen our relationship with those customers by expanding our service offerings with them. For instance, in 2021 one of our natural gas compressor customers using our heavy haul services requested additional flatbed services for other items allowing us to grow with that customer.
Our company headquarters are located in Houston, Texas.
Sales Plan
The Company’s sales plan includes utilizing employed sales personnel based in our various locations that are engaged to generate sales. Our sales personnel are typically compensated on a fixed base salary plus performance incentives. We also engage commission-only salespersons from time to time to supplement the main employee-based sales force. We believe transportation services is a relationship-based business where sales relationships are important as well as safety record, equipment profile and quality of our employed and commission-based salespersons.
Safety
Our Company emphasizes a safety-focused culture and conducts mandatory orientations for all of its drivers and includes safety moments in its weekly staff meetings. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) requires that the Company perform drug and alcohol testing that meets DOT regulations, and its safety program includes pre-employment, random and post-accident drug testing and all other testing required by the DOT. The Company also utilizes safety in the field programs on a customary basis.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 258 employees of whom 21 were administrative, 7 were in sales and marketing and 230 were in service or operations. In addition, we may employ independent contractors from time to time. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, and we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory. Our independent contractors are either paid day rates or hourly commensurate with the job. Employees and independent contractors are required to execute agreements with us that set forth terms of engagement and contain customary confidentiality and non-competition provisions.
