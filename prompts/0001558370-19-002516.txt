 Item 1. Business
 We are developing a new class of cellular medicines, Red Cell Therapeutics, or RCTs. Based on our vision that human red blood cells are the foundation of the next significant innovation in medicine, we have designed a proprietary platform to genetically engineer and culture RCTs that are selective, potent and ready‑to‑use cellular therapies. We believe that our RCTs will provide life‑changing or life‑saving benefits for patients with severe diseases across multiple therapeutic areas. 
 We have generated hundreds of RCTs using our RED PLATFORM®, a highly versatile and proprietary cellular therapy platform. We are utilizing our universal engineering and manufacturing processes to advance a broad pipeline of RCT product candidates into clinical trials in rare diseases, cancer and autoimmune diseases. Common design and manufacturing elements of our RCTs should enable us to achieve significant advantages in product development. We are establishing end‑to‑end manufacturing capabilities and plan to develop commercial infrastructure to further establish Rubius Therapeutics as a leading, fully integrated cellular therapy company.
 Our RED PLATFORM builds upon the research and findings of Flagship Pioneering’s VentureLabs innovation team along with the discoveries of Professors Harvey Lodish and Hidde Ploegh of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at MIT. This work demonstrated the ability to differentiate donor‑derived CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells into enucleated red blood cells, or RBCs, with unprecedented efficiency at a small, laboratory scale. Based on this foundation, Flagship Pioneering’s VentureLabs innovation team recognized the potential for RBCs as an optimal framework for cellular therapies and invented methods to engineer RCTs to express biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface.
 Building upon these early discoveries, we have developed the RED PLATFORM, which enables us to engineer and culture RCT product candidates with a wide array of biotherapeutic proteins and biological functions that enable their use across multiple therapeutic areas. We have also invested considerably to scale the process of RCT manufacturing by acquiring our own manufacturing facility, which we believe will allow for the production of large quantities of reliable and reproducible RCT products from the initial stages of development through to commercial scale. We have and continue to build a broad portfolio of patent applications, know how, trade secrets, and other intellectual property that covers both our platform technologies as well as product discoveries, the breadth and depth of which is a strategic asset that could provide us with competitive advantages. As of February 28, 2019, we own or have an exclusive license under more than 100 patent applications across 26 different patent families, and we own one issued U.S. patent related to the treatment of phenylketonuria, or PKU.
 Although our RCT product candidates are in early stages of development and will require substantial resources to demonstrate technical feasibility and to establish clinical and regulatory validation, we believe that our RED PLATFORM could provide beneficial treatments for our target indications, many of which have few, if any, effective treatments. Our initial focus will be advancing RCT product candidates with unique benefits for patients with rare diseases, cancer and autoimmune diseases based on three modalities — cellular shielding, potent cell‑cell interaction and tolerance induction. In March 2019, we announced that the FDA cleared our investigational new drug, or IND, application for our lead product candidate, RTX-134, an RCT with the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzyme expressed within the cell for the treatment of phenylketonuria. 
     •Rare Diseases:  We engineer RCTs that express potent enzymes within the cell for the treatment of patients suffering from rare enzyme deficiency diseases. As they are located within the RCT, these enzymes are shielded from being neutralized by the immune system, thereby allowing the enzymes to degrade and clear the pathogenic metabolites that build up in such diseases. We believe these RCTs may have a longer and sustained treatment duration and could avoid the immune‑driven reduction in efficacy and induction of adverse events associated with other therapies.

 •Cancer:  We engineer RCTs to recapitulate human immunobiology via potent cell‑cell interaction by expressing hundreds of thousands of copies of one or more proteins on the cellular surface to drive enhanced and synergistic activation of both the adaptive and innate immune systems in an antigen-specific approach or by broadly stimulating both arms of the immune system. We believe that these characteristics will translate into potent anti-tumor activity and limited off tissue adverse effects, because RCTs are generally confined to the vasculature and therefore, could be transformative therapies for patients with solid and hematological cancers.
 •Autoimmune Diseases:  We engineer RCTs that express specific autoimmune disease associated antigens within the cell or on the cell surface in order to induce and restore immune tolerance. We believe these RCTs could prevent immune damage that causes these diseases.
 Our product candidates are allogeneic, making them ready‑to‑use, and we expect them to have a predictable biodistribution and an approximate circulation time of up to 120 days, which should enable us to deliver well‑tolerated and convenient cellular therapies to a broad population.
 We are developing our initial RCT product candidates for PKU, a wide range of solid and hematological cancers and autoimmune diseases. In March 2019, we announced that the FDA cleared our IND for RTX‑134 for the treatment of PKU. We expect to begin enrolling patients for the Phase 1b clinical trial of RTX-134 during the second quarter of 2019, with initial data expected during the second half of 2019. We expect to file our first oncology IND for RTX-240 for the treatment of solid tumors by early 2020. We are in the early stages of assessing our RCT product candidates for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. We plan to file four to five INDs by the end of 2020, with additional filings thereafter.
 Pending positive clinical data based on validated, approvable endpoints, we plan to advance these RCT product candidates as well as a broader portfolio of rare disease, cancer and autoimmune therapies toward registration. We plan to seek orphan drug designation as well as pursue breakthrough therapy or Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designations for our RCT portfolio where appropriate, which we believe may shorten the time to market. 
 Since we commenced operations in 2013, we have attracted a talented group of seasoned leaders to execute our strategy. Our leadership team has more than 200 years of combined experience at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, has been involved in filing more than a combined 80 INDs and 20 submissions for product approval and has launched more than 30 pharmaceutical products.  We have raised approximately $498 million in private and public financings to date. We have also secured a credit facility that provides for up to $75 million in additional capital.
 Utilizing RBCs to create cellular therapies
 RBCs are the most ubiquitous cells in the human body, constituting over 80% of the body’s cells and playing a critical role in the delivery of oxygen to tissues. To constantly replenish this population of critical cells, the human body generates approximately 2.5 million RBCs every second. RBCs represent the first example of a transformative cellular therapy as physicians have been transfusing blood to patients since the early 1800s. Today, the focus around cellular therapies has largely been directed toward T cell and other lymphocyte‑based therapies. We believe that RBC‑based therapies will transform the cellular therapy landscape as they may represent the ideal cell type for the creation of versatile, well‑tolerated and ready‑to‑use cellular therapies. We believe such therapies could avoid many of the complications and risks often associated with earlier generation cellular therapies, including the emerging category of T cell-based therapies. These distinct characteristics of RBCs support their potential to serve as the foundation for a cellular therapy:
 •a predictable circulating time of approximately 120 days;
 •a well‑characterized and controllable biodistribution as RBCs are generally sequestered in the vasculature, spleen and liver. In exceptional cases, RBCs may enter the tumor microenvironment via leaky neo-vasculature;
 •the well‑established use of O negative blood as a universal source that can be administered to greater than 95% of people;

 
  6

 

 •the presence of certain surface markers, such as CD47, on RBCs provide what are referred to as “don’t eat me” signals, preventing the immune system from clearing RBCs from circulation; and
 •since RBCs are enucleated, they do not pose a risk of uncontrolled cell division or oncogenicity following transfusion.
 Today, blood transfusions remain one of the most commonly performed medical procedures, with approximately 85 million units of blood transfused worldwide each year. Significant infrastructure exists within most hospitals and outpatient infusion centers worldwide to support the administration of blood and blood‑derived products. We intend to leverage this infrastructure to administer our products if approved.
 Our proprietary RED PLATFORM
 We are pioneering the creation of a new transformative class of medicines that leverage the benefits of RBCs to provide cellular therapies to patients with severe diseases across multiple therapeutic areas. As RBCs are enucleated, they have generally been considered simple oxygen delivery vehicles, rather than the backbone of a versatile cellular therapy platform. Past attempts at RBC‑based therapies, such as applying hypotonic loading or cell swelling to load an enzyme or protein into RBCs, have had limited therapeutic applications, proven difficult to scale and reduced the in vivo half‑life of the loaded RBCs.
 Our discoveries and innovations in genetic engineering and cell culture processes have made it possible to now use RBCs as a foundation for the creation and development of a new class of cellular therapies. By modifying only one of our initial manufacturing steps in which we add a gene or genes that encode biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface of RCTs, we are able to rapidly develop new RCTs designed to treat different diseases. This approach allows for the consistent generation of product candidates and a preclinical evaluation process that we believe has the potential to create a broad range of therapeutics in an efficient manner — for example, RTX‑134 required only nine months from product design to identification as our lead RCT product candidate. Our uniform approach should also enable us to leverage common chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, and toxicology data packages to shorten development timelines. While the initial focus of our RED PLATFORM will be in rare diseases, cancer and autoimmune diseases, we believe the versatility of our platform will enable us to expand into broader therapeutic areas in the future.
 The RED PLATFORM allows us to generate a wide variety of allogeneic, ready‑to‑use RCT product candidates with a universal and proprietary process through the following steps: (1) obtaining CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells from the blood of O negative donors; (2) genetic engineering of the cells to express biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface of the RCTs; (3) expanding the number of cells and differentiating them into reticulocytes, which are enucleated RBC precursors; and (4) formulating, characterizing and storing doses of the resulting RCT product candidate for later infusion into patients.


 
  7

 

 A significant advantage of differentiating the cells into reticulocytes is the ability to separate the genetic modification from the final RCT product candidate through the biological process of enucleation, a property unique to reticulocytes. Enucleation involves the ejection of the nucleus from the cell, and with it, all the DNA it contains, leaving behind an RCT that expresses the protein or proteins that confer the intended therapeutic benefit. We believe this absence of genetic material may reduce the safety risks associated with RCTs as compared with current cellular therapies.
 Limitations of previous and current cellular therapies
 The field of tissue, cell and regenerative therapy has a long history, starting with blood transfusions in the early 1800s, followed by organ and bone marrow transplants in the middle of the 20th century and later the approval of cellular therapy products ranging from epidermal transplantation for wound care to mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of graft versus host disease and dendritic cells for the treatment of prostate cancer.
 Most recently, several biotechnology companies and academic groups have demonstrated that a type of cell therapy known as chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR‑Ts, where a patient’s own T cells are genetically engineered to recognize and attack specific cancer cells, are capable of powerful and sometimes curative therapeutic effects. In addition, some groups are studying the adoptive transfer and activation of T cell receptor, or TCR, -engineered T cells, and natural killer cells, or NK cells, for treatment of solid and hematologic cancers, while others are attempting to expand and engineer regulatory T cells ex vivo for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
 A range of issues have historically limited the use of cellular therapies:
 •Limited therapeutic application:  Given the specialized nature of these prior cellular therapies, they have been designed for specific indications and lack the inherent flexibility to be applied broadly across multiple therapeutic areas.
 •Potentially serious side effects:  Many previous and current cellular therapies can cause serious side effects, including cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity and death. These alternative cellular therapies contain a nucleus and retain the ability to expand and differentiate post‑injection, potentially raising concern of uncontrolled cell division and transformation.
 •Unpredictable pharmacokinetics and biodistribution:  Current cellular therapies have an uncertain lifetime post‑infusion. In some cases, the therapeutic benefits quickly wane. In others, the cells will continue to divide, expand and potentially transform unpredictably over an extended period of time. Additionally, these cellular therapies can extravasate in an untargeted manner into healthy tissues throughout the body, which may result in severe adverse effects.
 •Costly manufacturing and delayed treatment:  Most previous and current cellular therapies are autologous, meaning they must be derived from a patient’s own cells to avoid rejection by the immune system. This results in a strictly customized, one‑to‑one manufacturing process for each individual patient, which is costly and difficult to scale, and involves a complex supply chain that can delay treatment for critically ill patients. Moreover, this approach does not allow for an industrialized effort that can be leveraged to rapidly develop additional product candidates.
 Advantages and versatility of our RED PLATFORM and RCTs
 Our discoveries and innovations in genetic engineering and cell culture processes allows us to leverage the inherent benefits of RBCs. We believe our RED PLATFORM and RCTs represent a transformative step in the evolution of cellular therapies as they are designed to confer desirable attributes for a next‑generation cellular therapy, including the following:
 •Broad therapeutic applications:  We have engineered hundreds of RCTs to have therapeutic potential across many areas, such as rare diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases and infectious diseases. These RCTs can be designed to express immune‑shielded enzymes or other proteins within the cell and 

 
  8

 
diverse proteins on the cell surface, including combinations of proteins for (1) potent cell‑cell interaction with T cells, NK cells or other cells; (2) tissue localization; and (3) induction of immune tolerance.
 •Advantageous tolerability:  Since RCTs lack a nucleus, they possess no genetic material and do not divide following infusion into patients. As a result, we believe our RCT product candidates will pose less risk than those associated with other cellular therapies, which have caused cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity and death and carry the potential risk of inducing oncogenicity.
 •Ready‑to‑use cellular therapies:  O negative donor blood is routinely used for blood transfusions and can be repeatedly transfused into approximately 95% of people. Similarly, RCTs are produced from O negative donor blood stem cells and are therefore allogeneic, ready‑to‑use cellular therapies that we believe will be tolerated by almost all patients.
 •Defined life in circulation and convenient dosing:  RBCs have a circulating time of approximately 120 days. We expect our RCTs to benefit from this long circulation time, resulting in more consistent pharmacodynamics and convenient dosing regimens thereby improving compliance and real‑life efficacy. Furthermore, a single proposed RCT dose will constitute less than 1% of normal red cells in a patient’s circulation.
 •Predictable biodistribution:  RBCs normally reside only in the vasculature, the spleen and the liver and do not otherwise extravasate into other healthy tissues. Biodistribution into the spleen allows for RCTs designed to stimulate the immune system to mount an attack against cancer, while biodistribution of RCTs expressing autoimmune disease‑causing antigens to specialized cells in the liver can induce tolerance and improve the signs and symptoms of autoimmune diseases. We anticipate that this predictable biodistribution will allow RCTs to trigger on‑target desired effects while avoiding off‑tissue engagement.
 •Efficient product engine:  Our RED PLATFORM provides a consistent product design and discovery approach where simply changing the added gene or genes that encode the biotherapeutic proteins that confer the intended therapeutic benefit allows us to develop new product candidates targeting different diseases.
 •Scalable and flexible manufacturing:  We manufacture RCTs in bioreactors that we intend to scale to thousands of liters. A single donor will allow us to manufacture up to hundreds to thousands of doses, depending on the therapeutic application. As a result, we expect the cost of goods sold for RCTs to be significantly lower than existing cellular therapies, such as CAR‑Ts. We manufacture RCTs using well‑characterized and validated lentiviral vectors. Cellular engineering approaches, such as viral and non‑viral transduction systems and mRNA delivery, may also be applied to RCTs which may provide additional product benefits and cost advantages. 
 Our strategy
 Our vision is to pioneer the creation of life‑changing or life‑saving and ready‑to‑use RCTs for patients with severe diseases. To achieve our vision, we are executing a strategy with the following key elements:
 Establish RCTs as a new class of cellular medicines, demonstrating their potential across three initial product categories: rare diseases, cancer and autoimmune diseases. We apply a rigorous and capital‑efficient approach to prioritize our product candidate pipeline, focusing on unmet need, feasibility, speed to proof‑of‑concept, easy‑to‑measure validated endpoints and commercial potential. In March 2019, the FDA cleared our  IND for RTX‑134 for the treatment of PKU. We expect to begin enrolling patients for the Phase 1b clinical trial of RTX-134 during the second quarter of 2019, with initial data expected during the second half of 2019. In total, we plan to file a total of four to five INDs by the end of 2020, with additional filings thereafter. 
 Efficiently advance multiple additional RCTs as product categories are validated following positive early proof‑of‑concept. We expect that early clinical success of our initial RCT product candidates could translate to other programs within the product category, validating our approach and enabling a rapid and efficient expansion of our rare disease, cancer and autoimmune disease product categories. For example, positive early clinical proof‑of‑concept for 

 
  9

 
RTX‑134 will validate the benefits of our approach for treating rare enzyme deficiency diseases using cellular shielding of potent enzymes and support our ability to successfully develop additional RCTs within this product category.
 Pursue accelerated paths to marketing authorization. We are pursuing indications with high unmet medical needs that may allow us to pursue accelerated paths to product registration, such as breakthrough therapy designation or RMAT designation by the FDA. Similarly, we expect to pursue accelerated routes to marketing authorization in Europe and other regions.
 Build a leading, fully integrated cellular therapy company. We are discovering, developing, manufacturing and may commercialize RCT products within certain product categories. Following potential approval of multiple RCT products in a particular category, we may leverage a dedicated commercial infrastructure to deliver our therapies to patients.
 Further strengthen our position as the pioneer of RCTs through continuous platform expansion and improvement. Our proprietary RED PLATFORM allows us to rapidly identify new product candidates and includes a universal manufacturing process for all RCT product candidates. We will continue to invest in enhancing our platform and deepening our expertise in stem cell and red cell biology and optimizing the pharmacology of RCTs with the goal of delivering new therapies targeting additional indications. We plan to leverage our first‑mover advantage in manufacturing RCTs as we scale‑up our proprietary manufacturing platform. To fully support later‑stage clinical development and commercial launch, we plan to ensure control over our supply chain. As an initial investment in this strategy, we purchased a manufacturing facility and are in the process of renovating it to provide multi‑suite manufacturing capabilities.
 Expand patient access to RCTs through strategic partnerships. Given the breadth of the therapeutic opportunity for RCTs, we believe entering into select strategic partnerships in a subset of therapeutic areas may provide an attractive avenue for expanding patient access to RCTs. The global reach and operational expertise within certain pharmaceutical companies may complement our growing organization in areas such as clinical operations and commercialization.
 Maintain a strong culture, continuously attract new talent and build the world’s leading center for red cell biology research and engineering. We are located in one of the world’s leading hubs for biopharmaceutical innovation, which enables us access to world‑class talent, leading academic investigators and key opinion leaders. We have leveraged our location to attract scientific talent and experienced, innovative leaders and have built a strong culture that is committed to delivering on our vision. In addition, we have assembled a network of scientific advisors with deep expertise in red cell biology, process development and manufacturing as well as clinical experience across the therapeutic areas that we are initially targeting. We will continue to build a team of employees, advisors and collaborators with experience in the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of cellular therapies.
 Initial therapeutic areas of focus
 Based upon the totality of scientific and preclinical work to date, we believe that RCTs have broad potential therapeutic applications. Our initial focus will be advancing RCT product candidates with unique benefits for patients with rare diseases, cancer and autoimmune diseases based on three modalities — cellular shielding, potent cell‑cell interaction and tolerance induction.

 Select RCT Modalities to Treat Rare Diseases, Cancer and Autoimmune Diseases

 Rare diseases
 We believe that RCTs may be used to treat certain rare diseases caused by a single genetic defect that results in the inactivation of a critical metabolic enzyme or bioactive protein. Manufacturing the missing protein or enzyme and administering it to the patient may potentially correct this deficiency, but unfortunately many of these proteins or enzymes are highly immunogenic or poorly tolerated by patients, thereby limiting or, in some cases, preventing their therapeutic use. While biopharmaceutical companies are developing gene therapies for the treatment for several diseases caused by single genetic defects, this approach has historically been associated with unpredictable outcomes, including inconsistent efficacy and the potential for toxicity. In contrast, RCTs may provide the following benefits to patients suffering from rare diseases:
 •Highly active therapy through cellular shielding:  RCT product candidates engineered to express enzymes and other proteins within the cell, including poorly tolerated non‑human enzymes, effectively hide these proteins from the immune system, thereby shielding them from being neutralized or causing severe adverse effects, such as anaphylaxis. We expect these cellular shielding RCT product candidates will provide well‑tolerated and predictable therapeutic benefits, which may enable their chronic use and adoption as the preferred treatment option for a number of rare diseases.
 •Convenient dosing regimen:  Based on RBCs’ approximate circulation time of 120 days, we expect our RCT product candidates will have substantially longer half‑lives in patients compared to current treatments, many of which require a daily or weekly treatment regimen. This expected extended in vivo half‑life would allow for a more convenient dosing regimen of monthly to quarterly infusions, which may drive higher compliance with therapy and improve real‑life efficacy.
 Our initial RCT product candidates in rare diseases include RTX‑134 for the treatment of PKU. In March 2019, the FDA cleared our IND for RTX‑134 for the treatment of PKU. We expect to begin enrolling patients for the Phase 1b clinical trial of RTX-134 during the second quarter of 2019, with initial data expected during the second half of 2019. We anticipate RTX‑134 will be followed by several additional programs including RTX-Uricase for the treatment of chronic refractory gout and RTX-CBS for the treatment of homocystinuria.

 Cancer
 We believe that RCTs will have broad therapeutic applicability across a range of both solid and hematological cancers. Beyond standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments that have historically been the mainstay of care, a growing number of small molecule, antibody, nanoparticle and cellular therapies are now being applied to the treatment of cancer. While extraordinary lifespan and quality of life gains have been made, many treatments fail to provide benefit to patients or the disease relapses over time due to cellular escape mechanisms that make specific tumors unresponsive to these treatments. RCTs may provide the following benefits to cancer patients:
 •Immune activation via potent cell‑cell interaction:  Our RCT product candidates have been engineered to  broadly stimulate the adaptive and innate immune systems through T cell activation and NK cell activation, thereby stimulating these cells to attack and kill tumors. We have observed in vitro and in vivo that our RCT product candidates bind and activate multiple existing and emerging immuno‑oncology targets. Due to both the natural presentation and the high copy number of the expressed protein, which results in strong binding to cellular receptors, along with the ability to co‑express multiple proteins on the surface of each RCT, surface‑engineered RCTs may either (i) elicit potent immunostimulatory effects in immunogenic tumors characterized by higher mutation rates, T cell infiltration or checkpoint protein expression, or (ii) enable non‑immunogenic tumors to become immunogenic and then drive immunostimulatory effects. 
 •Antigen specific immune activation via cell surface antigen presenting: Other RCT product candidates of ours have been engineered to express a tumor associated antigen, a co-stimulatory signal and a cytokine at the same time on the same cell. This represents a recapitulation of normal human immune biology and results in highly selective tumor cell killing and the generation and maintenance of T-cell memory.
 •Tumor starvation:  We have developed RCT product candidates that express enzymes designed to deplete essential amino acids from the tumor microenvironment. This approach can starve a fast‑growing tumor of a metabolite that is essential for its growth and proliferation. This approach has shown potential in certain pediatric cancers although enzymes used for this approach are often highly immunogenic and poorly tolerated. We believe that shielding these enzymes from the immune system may reduce immunogenic side effects, prolong therapeutic exposure and thus lead to a more efficacious therapy.
 •Tumor targeting and killing:  Our RCT product candidates have been generated with high copy numbers of tumor‑binding and tumor‑killing proteins on their surface. By virtue of the high copy number and presentation of these proteins via membrane attachment, we believe that these RCT product candidates will demonstrate high target binding strength on the surface of cancer cells to drive potent anti‑tumor responses. Selectively engaging immune cells in the vasculature may limit the on‑target/off‑tissue side effects seen with other immuno‑oncology therapies.
 Our first RCT product candidate in cancer is RTX-240 (formerly RTX-212), which we expect to initially study in patients whose disease has progressed on checkpoint inhibitor therapy across a range of solid tumor types and in patients with acute myeloid leukemia following hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Additionally, we are advancing our second product, RTX-224, in a similar setting, but with the added benefit of potentially addressing patient sub-populations with non-immunogenic tumors. Finally, we are developing a number of RCTs that function as artificial antigen‑presenting cells. Our initial focus is for the treatment of HPV16+ expressing tumors, including head and neck and cervical cancer, among others. We plan to follow this with a range programs that could target viral antigens, cancer/testis, or CT,  antigens and neoantigens.
 Autoimmune diseases
 Our RCT product candidates have shown potential in preclinical studies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Available therapies for autoimmune diseases have significant limitations because these therapies are required to be administered on a chronic, lifelong basis. Many treatments fail to provide adequate benefit to patients, and many patients’ diseases will eventually progress despite continued therapy. Furthermore, these existing treatments are associated with side effects that include opportunistic infections, lymphoma and in some cases severe and even fatal infusion reactions. We believe RCTs can be designed to more specifically modulate complex counter‑regulatory immune responses and enable greater efficacy with lower toxicity, potentially providing treatments for a number of diseases with 

 
  12

 
high unmet need. Specifically, RCTs may provide the following benefits to patients suffering from autoimmune diseases:
 •Induction of peripheral tolerance:  We believe the processing of RCTs that express autoimmune disease‑causing antigens by specialized cells in the liver can induce tolerance and improve the signs and symptoms of autoimmune diseases. Our preclinical data suggests that RBCs are capable of inducing peripheral tolerance to RBC‑bound antigens, which is the ability to prevent these antigens from triggering dangerous responses to the body’s own tissues. We have observed the feasibility of this approach in preclinical studies in models of neurodegeneration and diabetes and believe that many proteins presented on RCTs should benefit from this tolerance induction. We believe our antigen-specific autoimmune RCT product candidates have the potential to be curative therapies for antigen‑induced autoimmune diseases, including Type 1 diabetes.
 •Cytokine neutralization:  The high copy number and thereby high local density of a binding protein on the surface of an RCT enables efficient sequestration and neutralization of soluble targets in circulation. This may also limit off‑target effects by confining the binding protein to the vasculature through expression on the RCT cell surface. In preclinical studies, we have observed the ability of RCTs to bind cytokines and foreign proteins with high affinity and thereby neutralize their function. For example, we have observed the ability of an RCT that expresses an anti‑TNF‑alpha protein on its cell surface, to neutralize lethal doses of TNF‑alpha in preclinical studies.
 •Antibody clearance:  High affinity capture of antibodies on RCTs could allow for effective neutralization and clearance of pathological antibodies for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenia. Clearance may be enhanced when surface binding is complemented with a surface‑expressed protease, resulting in the destruction of the pathological antibody. We have observed the ability of RCTs to bind to circulating antibodies both in vitro and in vivo. We have also co‑expressed antibody binders and proteases on the surface of RCTs and observed that they are active.
 •Targeting and inhibiting immune cells:  We have engineered RCTs to induce the activation of certain immune regulatory cells, which in turn alter the body’s general immune repertoire and restore the system to a tolerogenic state. 
 We are currently assessing these RCT product candidates and expect to select our first clinical candidate for treatment of autoimmune diseases in 2019.
 Our product candidate pipeline
 We are building a broad and diverse pipeline of RCT product candidates in rare diseases, cancer and autoimmune diseases. In March 2019, the FDA cleared our IND for RTX‑134 for the treatment of PKU. We expect to begin enrolling patients for the Phase 1b clinical trial of RTX-134 during the second quarter of 2019, with initial data expected during the second half of 2019. We expect to file a total of four to five INDs by the end of 2020, with additional filings thereafter. Our first product candidates were selected based on: potential to address unmet medical needs; feasibility as determined by our preclinical research and development efforts; potential to rapidly achieve proof‑of‑concept based on easy‑to‑measure validated regulatory endpoints; and significant commercial potential.

 An overview of our programs and their status is illustrated below:

 Definitions: CBS—cystathionine beta synthase; OxOx—oxalate oxidase; αPD1—patients progressed on or refractory to anti‑programmed death receptor 1 monoclonal antibody; R/R AML—acute myeloid leukemia; HSCT—hematopoietic stem cell transplant; HPV+—Human papilloma virus positive; APC—antigen presenting cell
 Rare diseases
 Our initial rare disease programs target enzyme deficiencies with limited treatment options. Our RED PLATFORM allows us to explore a broader range of human, non‑human, engineered and combinations of enzymes with higher activity than those available to companies developing native or pegylated products. Clinical trials in rare disease indications are of a relatively short duration, of modest size and employ validated biomarkers that can be used to highlight initial efficacy and support product approval.
 RTX‑134 for treatment of phenylketonuria
 Indication / opportunity
 PKU is caused by a deficiency of functional phenylalanine hydroxylase, or PAH, which is the enzyme that breaks down dietary phenylalanine, or Phe. Phe is an essential amino acid found in many foods including milk, eggs, meat and soybeans. Patients with PKU are unable to break down Phe and the resulting high levels of Phe can cause motor dysfunction, psychiatric disorders and irreversible brain damage.
 Newborn screening programs, which were implemented in the 1960s and 1970s, are used throughout the developed world to identify children with PKU and, as a result, virtually all patients with PKU under the age of 40 have been diagnosed at birth. It has been estimated that the incidence of PKU in the United States is one in 12,707, which translates to approximately 300 cases per year with an overall prevalence of 15,000. It has also been estimated that the prevalence 

 
  14

 
of PKU in the E.U. is 25,000. Worldwide, the estimated prevalence is more than 50,000. The clinical presentation of PKU ranges from mild to severe, with blood Phe levels measured to determine disease severity. In Classic PKU, Phe levels are 1,200 μmol/L or greater; in Moderate PKU, Phe levels range from 600 to 1,200 μmol/L; and in Mild PKU, Phe levels are below 600 μmol/L.
 Patients with Classic PKU comprise approximately 40% of all PKU patients in the United States, are at the greatest health risk and are the most difficult to treat. Typical symptoms in children with Classic PKU include seizures, behavioral problems and delayed development. Without proper treatment, progressive motor dysfunction is inevitable. Studies have indicated that for each 300 μmol/L rise in average Phe for those aged five to eight years, patient’s IQ fell by four to six points. Adults with Classic PKU exhibit a range of symptoms, including deterioration in executive function (such as language, memory, learning), attention deficit issues, depression, anxiety, impaired affect and autistic features and Parkinsonian‑like tremors. These manifestations of the disease result in a profoundly impaired quality of life and an inability to comply with treatment, potentially resulting in further deterioration of executive function.
 Patients with Moderate PKU represent approximately 20% of all PKU patients in the United States. They can often manage their disease by adhering to a tightly restricted, protein free diet. However, if the disease is not managed diligently, these patients remain at risk of intellectual disability and are likely to exhibit signs of neuropsychological disturbances. Patients with Mild PKU, who represent the remaining 40% of all U.S. PKU patients, are at a lower risk for impairments in executive function but may still benefit from treatment if Phe levels are above 120 μmol/L.
 Our initial target patient population for RTX‑134 will be patients with Phe levels greater than or equal to 600 μ mol/L.
 Limitations of current therapies
 Treatment in the first decade of life is essential in realizing optimal clinical outcomes for PKU patients. The current mainstay of therapy for PKU is an extreme restriction of dietary Phe and requires that patients purchase expensive and unpalatable specially formulated medical foods. Since breast milk contains Phe, pediatric patients are started on a low Phe regimen at birth and plasma levels are monitored weekly until age five. In general, with great effort, parents are able to manage the diet of the youngest children with PKU and most are well controlled.
 Target Phe levels in adolescence and adulthood are less clear but it is generally accepted in the United States that patients with Phe levels below 600 μmol/L are at lower risk of cognitive impairment over time. Guidelines suggest that dietary restrictions should continue indefinitely, however compliance tends to wane as patients age and enter school. Adolescents with PKU may find it challenging to comply with the extreme dietary restrictions that are required to control their Phe levels, and since they are undergoing active neural maturation they are particularly at risk of cognitive impairment. Only a minority of adult patients are well controlled based upon diet alone. Once dietary compliance falters, the odds that a patient will return to treatment becomes less likely over time. In addition, the long‑term outcome of extreme protein restriction in patients is not clear and there are clinical studies ongoing to assess the impact on bone and renal health.
 Sapropterin dihydrochloride, or sapropterin, was the first therapy approved in the United States to treat PKU. Sapropterin is an oral synthetic version of BH4, a cofactor that is required for PAH activity. Administering this cofactor can be helpful for patients with existing but ineffective PAH. Clinical data, however, suggests that sapropterin is not fully effective in lowering high serum levels of Phe back to normal levels and it must be used in conjunction with a low Phe diet. Sapropterin is used in fewer than 15% of PKU patients, in part due to lack of efficacy in patients with more severe Classic PKU.
 Phenylalanine ammonia lyase, or PAL, is a naturally occurring enzyme that is primarily found in some plants and fungi and which converts Phe to ammonia and trans‑cinnamic acid, or TCA. TCA is subsequently converted to hippuric acid in the liver and cleared from the body through urinary excretion. Although administration of PAL has been shown to reduce Phe levels in preclinical studies and clinical trials of PKU patients, it has also been found to be highly immunogenic.

 Pegvaliase, a pegylated version of PAL, was approved in May 2018 by the FDA to reduce blood phenylalanine concentrations in adult patients with phenylketonuria who have uncontrolled blood phenylalanine concentrations greater than 600 micromol per liter on existing management. However, in its registrational trials, neutralizing antibodies were detected in 249 out of 284, or 88%, of the patients and many of the patients that participated in the first phase (PRISM 1) failed to reach the target of a 20% reduction in Phe, which was the entry criteria for the placebo‑controlled phase (PRISM 2). In addition, pegvaliase caused hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis, which necessitated an extended tolerization schedule resulting in months of delay to reach a therapeutic dose. The drug’s black box warning label indicates that the first injection should be administered under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis, and then should be administered as a daily subcutaneous injection, which makes compliance with the treatment regimen difficult, particularly as patients go through this extended tolerization period. Physicians are instructed, per the black box warning label, to prescribe auto‑injectable epinephrine, and patients are instructed to carry one at all times while on therapy.
 Pegvaliase is priced at $488 per 20 mg/ml syringe wholesale acquisition cost, and BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. expects that, when taking compliance and discounts into account, the cost per patient per year is expected to be $192,000. Even in the absence of pegvaliase treatment, the cost of care for PKU patients can add up to more than $100,000 per year, which can include costs for medical foods and current therapies. Additional inpatient mental health and residential medical facility care for patients can cost between $60,000 and $200,000 per year depending on the patient’s level of intellectual and functional disability. These are only the most significant direct costs and do not include the indirect economic impact of an impaired ability to work or maintain meaningful employment.
 Overall, treatment options for the majority of Classic and Moderate PKU patients are limited. We believe that an RCT product candidate that expresses PAL has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing therapies and offer relief to patients suffering from PKU.
 Product candidate description and preclinical data
 RTX‑134 is an RCT product candidate that we have genetically engineered to express PAL in the cytosol of the RCT. We expect RTX‑134 will reduce Phe to clinically meaningful levels through infrequent, low volume intravenous infusions. We plan to apply for orphan drug designation for RTX‑134.
 In preclinical studies, we have observed that PAL is highly active when expressed in the cytosol of RTX‑134 as measured both by reduction in Phe and concomitant generation of TCA. We have also observed that Phe uptake into RTX‑134 is not rate limiting for its activity.

 In preclinical mouse studies, we observed that PAL expressing murine RCTs, or mRCT‑GFP‑PAL, have a circulation time of approximately 50 days, which is equivalent to the normal circulating time of mouse RBCs. Based upon this finding, we expect RTX‑134 to have an approximate circulating time of up to 120 days in PKU patients, the normal circulating time of human RBCs.
 Circulation Time of mRCT‑GFP‑PAL

 Based on available clinical data from PKU patients and our preclinical data, we have developed a pharmacodynamic model for RTX‑134 to project the RTX‑134 starting dose in the first clinical trial in PKU patients.

 Clinical development
 In March 2019, we announced that the FDA cleared our IND for RTX-134 for the treatment of PKU.  We expect to begin enrolling patients for the Phase 1b clinical trial of RTX-134 during the second quarter of 2019, with initial data expected during the second half of 2019. The clinical objectives associated with our initial Phase 1b trial of RTX-134 are preliminary safety; longevity of cells in circulation; production of trans-cinnamic acid, a biomarker of RTX-134’s mechanism of action; and preliminary dose and schedule.
 Following FDA review of the data from the Phase 1b trial, we plan to investigate multi-dose administration of RTX-134 to further evaluate safety and magnitude of Phe reduction which is a measure of efficacy in PKU trials. Assuming favorable results from the planned multi-dose administration phase of the trial, we expect to advance RTX‑134 to a registrational trial and to begin a pediatric trial.
 RTX-Uricase for treatment of chronic refractory gout
 Indication / opportunity
 Gout is a metabolic and inflammatory disease often affecting middle‑aged to elderly men and postmenopausal women. After years of repetitive attacks, patients develop chronic refractory gout, which is characterized by the buildup of tophi, or deposits of uric acid crystals in the joints, kidney and heart. Tophi can lead to the development of chronic arthritis and an increased risk of developing kidney stones, chronic renal insufficiency and cardiovascular disease. Once patients reach this stage, they generally suffer multiple attacks every year.
 The prevalence of gout increases with age and risk factors include insulin resistance, obesity, and a diet rich in meat and seafood. The number of patients diagnosed with gout in the United States is estimated to be approximately eight million and is increasing with population growth. In Europe, prevalence is equal or close to that in the United States at this time. Approximately 50,000 to 60,000 gout patients in the United States per year fail all therapy and are considered chronic refractory.
 Limitations of current therapies
 Patients who experience at least two attacks per year or present with tophi are considered candidates for uric acid‑lowering therapy. Three classes of therapies are currently approved for decreasing uric acid levels: xanthine oxidase inhibitors, uricosuric agents and uricase agents.
 The first‑line standard of care for gout is xanthine oxidase inhibition, which blocks uric acid synthesis, and is an effective treatment option for many. For patients who require more control or who are contraindicated, the uricosuric agent, lesinurad, may be prescribed. Lesinurad is an oral inhibitor of URAT1, which is the transporter that mediates reuptake of uric acid from the proximal tubules of the kidney and drives renal elimination of uric acid. Lesinurad carries a black box warning associated with renal toxicity and is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment.
 Chronic refractory patients are candidates for pegloticase, which converts uric acid into allantoin, which is then excreted via the kidneys. Pegloticase is the only currently approved uricase agent available for the treatment of chronic refractory gout. Pegloticase, while generally considered effective, has several shortcomings. It carries a black box warning for anaphylaxis and there have been serious cardiovascular events associated with pegloticase. Furthermore, its administration is inconvenient with patients having to undergo a four‑hour premedication/infusion process once every two weeks.
 The economic burden of chronic refractory gout is driven by a combination of emergency room visits, bedridden days and recurring loss of economic productivity. Over time, the progression of the disease may result in long‑term disability. Beyond these costs, patients with recurring attacks and higher serum uric acid levels also suffer high rates of hypertension, renal impairment, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia and ischemic heart disease.

 
  18

 

 Overall, treatment options for the majority of the chronic refractory gout patients are limited. We believe that an RCT product candidate that expresses uricase has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing therapies and offer relief from debilitating pain to the tens of thousands of patients suffering from chronic refractory gout. Based on the expected tolerability profile, RTX-Uricase may also have applications in a broader chronic gout population as prior lines of therapy carry black box safety warnings.
 Product candidate description and preclinical data
 RTX-Uricase is an RCT product candidate that we have genetically engineered to express hundreds of thousands of copies of uricase along with a uric acid transporter that ensures optimal uptake of uric acid into the cell. We expect that RTX-Uricase will augment a patient’s ability to clear uric acid, meaningfully reduce uric acid levels in the blood, and reduce the frequency of painful attacks and number of tophi. We also believe that the shielding of uricase in our RCT will avoid the safety concerns associated with the administration of pegloticase. We anticipate that RTX-Uricase will require monthly or less frequent dosing with low volume intravenous infusions. We plan to file for orphan drug designation given the small, well‑defined patient population and the unmet need.
 Similar to the clinical candidate development approach that we used for RTX‑134, we have developed a pharmacodynamic model for RTX-Uricase and have determined the target uricase activity needed to achieve clinically meaningful reductions in uric acid. As part of our lead development and optimization process, we have demonstrated that RCTs expressing uricase and a transporter meet the targeted expression and activity levels and have demonstrated co‑expression of uricase and a transporter for RTX-Uricase.
 Clinical development
 We plan to study RTX-Uricase in patients with chronic refractory gout to determine the safety profile, appropriate RTX-Uricase dose and dosing interval needed to achieve serum uric acid of less than 6 mg/dL. At uric acid levels below 6 mg/dL, uric acid crystals do not form and crystals already formed begin to dissolve. This target goal for demonstrating efficacy in chronic treatment refractory gout patients has been accepted by the FDA and the EMA and was the basis for approval of pegloticase.
 RTX‑CBS for treatment of homocystinuria
 Indication / opportunity
 Homocystinuria refers to a group of enzyme deficiency disorders that result in elevated levels of circulating homocysteine, or Hcy, and its metabolites. The majority of homocystinuria patients suffer mutations of a gene that regulates the production of the enzyme known as cystathionine beta‑synthase, or CBS, which is required for the conversion of Hcy to cystathionine.
 Homocysteine is a highly reactive amino acid that can cause lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, cellular metabolic disruption, programmed cell death and immune activation, which all contribute to atherogenesis, or the formation of abnormal plaques in the inner lining of blood vessels. Elevated levels of homocysteine result in a wide range of deforming and debilitating symptoms. By age three, failure to thrive is generally apparent and partial dislocation of the lens of the eyes and severe myopia are common. Without treatment, children may suffer from progressive and severe neurodegeneration. In addition, many of these children will develop psychiatric disturbances and experience seizures. A failure to effectively treat patients over time can also result in aberrant musculoskeletal development, including Marfanoid features, characterized by abnormally long limbs and digits and scoliosis, or spinal curvature. Patients with homocystinuria suffer from extreme hypertension and are at an elevated risk for the development of thromboembolisms. If untreated, approximately 50% of patients will have a thromboembolic event and the overall mortality rate is approximately 20% by age 30.
 The signs and symptoms of homocystinuria typically develop within the first year of life, but some mildly affected patients may not develop symptoms until later in life, particularly because this is a progressive disorder. Patient population estimates range widely, but the National Organization for Rare Disorders suggests a worldwide prevalence of 1:344,000, which when applied to the combined U.S. and E.U. population of 830 million would suggest an initial 

 
  19

 
treatment market of approximately 2,400 diagnosed patients in these regions. However, this is potentially an underrepresentation of the true population size as the literature suggests that current newborn screening tests may not be adequately sensitive or specific. This suggestion is further reinforced by the fact that patients may present with thromboembolism later in life, without a prior diagnosis. Finally, studies based on genotyping rather than clinical diagnosis conducted in Europe suggest a much higher prevalence of potentially asymptomatic patients. The burden and cost of care for homocystinuria is high as the major clinical manifestations of the disease include mental retardation, dislocation of the optic lens, skeletal deformity and potentially fatal thromboembolic crises.
 Limitations of current therapies
 The general therapeutic goal for homocystinuria is to reduce serum and cellular Hcy accumulation and thus limit the development of existing symptoms and prevent the onset of new symptoms. Early diagnosis, treatment and aggressive diet restriction have been shown to slow the progression of disease as well as to reverse some of the symptoms. Treatment practice varies widely and compliance with diet drops with age. High‑dose pyridoxine, or vitamin B6, is a treatment capable of relieving some clinical symptoms of disease for approximately half of all homocystinuria patients. Even for those for whom it is effective, though, it carries the significant limitations of requiring a moderately restrictive diet and the risk of overdosing. Meanwhile, patients who do not respond to vitamin B6 treatment remain subjected to a stringent protein restricted diet along with a methionine‑free amino acid formulation supplement, which they are often not able to maintain.
 An oral betaine anhydrous solution is the only approved drug for homocystinuria. Physicians’ use of betaine varies widely in practice and there is preclinical data to suggest that patients become non‑responsive to betaine supplementation resulting in waning efficacy over time.
 Overall, treatment options for most patients with homocystinuria are limited. We believe that an RCT product candidate that expresses CBS has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing therapies and offer relief to patients diagnosed with homocystinuria and ultimately reduce the risk of thromboembolisms and cardiac events in those patients that present without symptoms.
 Product candidate description and review of preclinical data
 RTX‑CBS is an RCT product candidate that we have genetically engineered to express hundreds of thousands of copies of CBS in the cytosol of the cell. We expect RTX‑CBS will replace the patient’s missing or ineffective enzymes and rapidly drop total plasma homocysteine, or tHcy, levels to clinically meaningful targets through infrequent, low volume intravenous infusions.
 Similar to RTX‑134 and RTX-Uricase, we have established a pharmacodynamic model to determine the target CBS activity required for clinical activity and to project clinical dose levels and frequency. Enzyme expression refinement in RTX‑CBS is still ongoing and we are characterizing the transport of Hcy and serine into RTX‑CBS and secretion of cystathionine out of the cell to determine whether or not co‑expression of a transporter may be required.
 Clinical development
 Our target indication for RTX‑CBS will be the treatment of patients suffering from symptomatic homocystinuria who are unresponsive to vitamin B6 therapy. Pending confirmation by the FDA, we expect that reduction in plasma tHcy levels to be below 50 μM will be an acceptable primary endpoint for our clinical trials. We plan to evaluate RTX-CBS in patients with symptomatic homocystinuria based on genetic confirmation of CBS mutation and plasma tHcy equal or greater than 100 μM. In such evaluation, our goal is to determine the safety profile, appropriate dose and dosing interval of RTX‑CBS necessary to maintain plasma tHcy below clinical target levels. As the disease is primarily diagnosed in pediatric patients and can be lethal, we will explore the potential for obtaining a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher from the FDA.

 Rare diseases discovery research
 Our RED PLATFORM has generated RCT product candidates that shield immunogenic enzymes and express transporters on their surface. As a result, we believe that we can design RCTs to address many rare diseases where pathogenic metabolites build up. We are using the same RCT product candidate development approach as applied for RTX‑134, RTX-Uricase and RTX‑CBS to develop a portfolio of RCTs for treatment of a range of rare diseases. One example is RTX‑OxOx, which expresses oxalate oxidase for the treatment of second‑line hyperoxaluria, a condition characterized by recurrent kidney and bladder stones, which can result in end stage renal disease in severe cases. 
 Cancer
 We believe that RCTs will have broad therapeutic applicability across a range of both solid and hematological cancers and are developing a pipeline of RCTs that target T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, tumor cells, or combinations thereof.
 Our lead product candidates for the treatment of cancer are RTX-240 (formerly RTX-212) and RTX-224. RTX-240 is a RCT that co-expresses both 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP, a fusion of IL‑15 and IL‑15 receptor alpha, which synergizes with 4‑1BBL to activate and expand both T cells and NK cells. We expect to file an IND for RTX-240 by early 2020. RTX-224 is a combination RCT expressing both 4‑1BBL and IL‑12. IL-12 drives the proliferation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, as well as NK cells. In addition, the IL-12 cytokine is known to drive antigen presentation and inhibit angiogenesis. We believe that both product candidates provide potentially transformative and differentiated approaches to treating patients with solid or hematological tumors whose disease responds to immunotherapies, including CAR-T, as well as tumors that are or have become resistant or refractory to immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors. We expect to initially study RTX-240 in patients whose disease has  progressed on checkpoint inhibitor therapy across a range of solid tumor types and in patients with acute myeloid leukemia following a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. We expect to study RTX-224 in patients with a range of both immunologically active and immunologically inactive solid tumors.
 Additionally, we are advancing RCTs that function as artificial antigen presenting cells, or RTX-aAPCs. Our initial focus is on displaying tumor antigens fused to major histocompatibility complex class I, or MHC I, on the surface of RCTs that also express a costimulatory signal, such as 4‑1BBL and a cytokine such as IL-12 or IL-15. We expect to study one or more of these RTX‑aAPCs in patients with tumors that express these antigens. Our lead aAPC program targets HPV+ tumors, of which head and neck and cervical cancer are the most common.  Treatment options for HPV16+ refractory and relapsing disease, including head and neck, and cervical cancer are limited, and our goal is to be able to offer patients a potent and highly specific immune stimulation.  
 We are also exploring tumor‑targeted RCTs that co‑express 4‑1BBL and single‑chain variable fragments, or scFvs, that bind to tumor antigens. We expect tumor‑targeted RTX‑4‑1BBL to provide a potent, selective and potentially safe treatment for hematological tumors either as a monotherapy or in combination with existing adoptive cell therapies or checkpoint inhibitors.    RTX-240 and RTX-224
 Each of RTX-240 and RTX-224 have been engineered to act as combination therapies that stimulate both the adaptive and innate arms of the immune system. We believe this synergistic activity has the potential to provide the following therapeutic benefits:
 •Improved anti‑tumor activity through broad and sustained activation of the immune system: Both RTX-240 and RTX-224 drive robust stimulation of both T cells and NK cells as 4‑1BBL and the cytokines (IL-15TP or IL-12)  are simultaneously presented in high copy numbers to these immune cells, thereby simulating a potent adaptive and innate immune response. We expect this to result in improved response rates, progression free survival, or PFS, and overall survival, either as monotherapy or in combination with existing immunomodulatory therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T.
 •Prevention of resistance to immunotherapy:  T cells recognize and kill cancer cells via MHC I. A recognized mechanism of tumor resistance to checkpoint inhibitors is loss of MHC I expression, which makes the cancer less 

 
  21

 
susceptible to T cell mediated killing. However, loss of MHC I makes the tumor susceptible to recognition and killing by the NK cells that have been expanded and activated by RTX-240. We, therefore, expect that RTX-240 used either alone or in combination with immunotherapies will prevent the emergence of resistance to T cell mediated killing through potent NK cell activation and expansion.
 •Efficacious in tumors that are resistant or refractory to immunotherapy:  We expect RTX-240 to provide therapeutic benefits to patients whose disease has progressed on checkpoint inhibitors. In these patients, we expect that RTX-240 will promote tumor killing through NK cell and T cell activation and expansion. The addition of IL-12 to 4-1BBL, in the case of RTX-224, is expected to drive the upregulation of T cell and NK cell activity, as well as angiogenesis inhibition and antigen presentation. The latter is important when addressing tumors that do not respond to existing immunotherapies.  
 •Tolerability:  We expect RTX-240 and RTX-224 to be confined to the vasculature, spleen and liver and, in some cases of  leaky neo‑vasculature, the tumor itself. We believe this makes these product candidates less likely to trigger on‑target/off‑tissue effects. Direct systemic administration of cytokines, including IL‑15, IL-12 and other interleukins, is currently limited by safety and tolerability concerns, which result in a narrower therapeutic window.
 RTX-240 and RTX-224 for the treatment of solid tumors
 Current therapies and their limitations
 Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti‑programmed death receptor‑1 antibodies, or anti‑PD‑1 antibodies, act by inhibiting tumor suppression of the adaptive immune system in cancer patients and have significantly extended survival in multiple solid tumor types, particularly in patients with advanced cancers. The vast potential of checkpoint inhibitors is highlighted by market projections that estimate sales for this class of drugs could reach $50 billion in 2024. Despite the encouraging efficacy of checkpoint inhibition for some patients, overall response rates remain relatively low and range, on average, from 25% to 50%. Unfortunately, even when patients do respond, many still progress within six to 12 months depending on the cancer and the therapeutic intervention. Clinicians and biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly evaluating combination therapies to improve response rates and to expand the size of the treatable population.
 Preclinical data for RTX‑4‑1BBL
 We have observed that RTX‑4‑1BBL, which expresses 4‑1BBL on the cell surface, drives potent T cell activation as measured by a standard in vitro assay in which intracellular signaling of NFkB, a protein complex that controls immune system responses, is measured using Jurkat cells, a human T cell line. As presented in the following chart, we observed activation up to 15‑fold more potent than the activation generated by the agonistic anti‑4‑1BB monoclonal antibody, utomilumab, which others have tested in cancer patients. We used RCT‑CTRL, a cultured red cell that does not express an active protein, as a negative control. Furthermore, we observed in this in vitro assay that increasing the copy number of the 4‑1BBL protein on RTX‑4‑1BBL results in a clear dose‑response for immune activation. We have therefore engineered the expression of 4‑1BBL on our RCT product candidates to maximize T cell activation.

 
  22

 

 NFkB Activation by RTX‑4‑1BBL in Jurkat Cells

 We observed that RTX‑4‑1BBL stimulates primary CD8+ and CD4+ T cells to proliferate and become activated, as measured by the production of two cytokines released by activated T cells that are central to the human immune response, interferon gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). RTX‑4‑1BBL stimulated a four to six‑fold and two to three‑fold increase in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively, and up to a three‑fold increase in IFNγ and TNFα production. In contrast, utomilumab alone did not stimulate any measurable proliferation and only minimal activation of T cells when compared to RCT‑CTRL. We believe that the potent T cell stimulating activity of RTX‑4‑1BBL is due to high expression of 4‑1BBL on the cell surface in its natural, trimeric conformation, simulating the immune synapse that is formed between APCs and T cells.


 
  23

 

 In Vitro Proliferation and Activation of Primary CD8+ and CD4+ T Cells by RTX‑4‑1BBL

 In preclinical mouse studies, we have observed that a murine version of RTX‑4‑1BBL, or mRCT‑4‑1BBL, drove potent stimulation of CD8+ T cells and key subpopulations of CD8+ T cells, such as proliferating CD8+ memory T cells, CD8+ effector T cells and Granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells, which are important for improved and sustained clinical response rates in cancer patients. The data presented in the following charts suggests that mRCT‑4‑1BBL is sufficient to stimulate close to maximal T cell activation and proliferation because the mRCT‑4‑1BBL drove similar levels of activation and proliferation of CD8+ T cells in vivo as a 25‑fold higher dose of 3H3, an anti‑mouse 4‑1BB agonistic monoclonal antibody (α4‑1BB mAb). The negative controls phosphate buffered saline, or PBS, and a murine control RCT that does not express an active protein, or mRCT‑CTRL, did not stimulate in vivo proliferation of CD8+ T cells. We believe this data supports our belief that high expression of 4‑1BBL on the cell surface in its natural, trimeric conformation, drives RTX‑4‑1BBL’s potent T cell stimulating activity.


 
  24

 

 In Vivo Proliferation of CD8+ T cells and Subsets Thereof by mRCT‑4‑1BBL

 In a mouse model of liver toxicity, we observed favorable tolerability of mRCT‑4‑1BBL. Levels of the liver enzymes aspartate transaminase, or AST, and alanine transaminase, or ALT, were not significantly elevated following administration of mRCT‑4‑1BBL, as compared to administration of a mRCT‑CTRL. In contrast, we observed significant elevations of the liver enzymes after administration of α4‑1BB mAb. This indicates that the potent stimulation of CD8+ T cells we observed in vivo with mRCT‑4‑1BBL was not accompanied by the liver toxicities that have been associated with administration of other anti‑4‑1BB agonists.

  Preclinical data for RTX 240    RTX-240 co‑expresses 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP on the cell surface to stimulate both an adaptive and innate immune response. 

 Using the Jurkat human T cell line, we observed potent T cell activation with RTX-240, as shown in the following chart. Importantly, we showed that the same level of T cell activation was not induced by molar equivalent doses of utomilumab. As expected, the control RCT, or RTX‑CTRL, was also inactive.


 
  26

 

 NFkB Activation by RTX-240 in Jurkat Cells
    
 Additionally, we have observed in vitro that RTX-240 can potently expand CD8+ T cells, NK cells and key subsets of these cells to a substantially greater extent than RTX‑4‑1BBL or RTX‑IL‑15TP alone, as shown in the following charts. In the absence of T cell stimulation with an anti‑CD3 antibody, we observed a synergistic effect from the combination of the 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP co‑expressed on RTX-240 in expanding both CD8+ memory (2.5 fold) and NK cells by approximately 10-15 fold. This was substantially higher than utomilumab, rhIL‑15, and a combination of utomilumab and rhIL‑15.
 In Vitro Proliferation and Activation of CD8+ Memory Cells and NK Cells by RTX‑240
    
 In a mouse model of liver toxicity, we observed no evidence of toxicity with mRCT‑240. Levels of aspartate transaminase, or AST, and alanine transaminase, or ALT, were not significantly elevated following administration of mRCT‑240, as compared to administration of mRCT‑CTRL. In contrast, we observed significant transaminase elevations after administration of α4‑1BB mAb. Liver infiltration with macrophages and CD8+ T cells are considered to be critical to 4‑1BBL‑induced liver toxicity. As expected, we observed increased liver infiltration with all of these cell 

 
  27

 
populations following treatment with 4‑1BB agonist antibodies. There was no increased liver infiltration with any of these cell populations following mRCT‑240 treatment.
     Liver Toxicity in Mice of mRCT‑240 Compared to α4‑1BB Agonist mAb
    
 4‑1BB agonistic antibodies are believed to cause liver toxicity through a multi‑step process that begins with activation of bone marrow‑derived monocytes, which subsequently infiltrate the liver, activating Kupffer cells and then CD8+ cells. Our data suggest that mRCT-240 does not stimulate the bone marrow derived monocytes, consistent with the hypothesis that activation occurs in the bone marrow, which has limited exposure to mRCT-240.
 Our in vivo studies of a murine surrogate of RTX-240, mRCT-240, administered intravenously, or i.v., in a B16F10 lung metastasis mouse model provide further evidence in support of RTX-240. In this model, tumor cells were injected intravenously to establish metastases in the lung and then mice were treated with mRCT-240 alone or in combination with an anti‑PD‑1 antibody. mRCT-240 administered i.v. as a monotherapy reduced tumor burden in mice compared to those treated with mRCT‑CTRL, mRCT‑4‑1BBL and mRCT‑IL‑15TP (left chart below), thereby indicating the potential synergy that may be achieved by expressing both 4‑1‑BBL and IL‑15TP on the cell surface of mRCT-240. The tumor burden reduction that was observed after administration of α4‑1BB mAb was not significantly different from mRCT-240. However, the observed effect of α4‑1BB mAb was at the same dose level that generated hepatotoxicity in mice. As mRCT-240 did not generate liver toxicity in mice, we believe that mRCT-240, if successfully developed and approved, may have an improved therapeutic index, or improved risk‑benefit, over agonistic 4‑1BB antibodies in cancer patients. In a separate study mRCT-240 administered i.v. in combination with the anti‑PD‑1 antibody significantly reduced tumor burden in mice compared to those treated with the negative control mRCT‑CTRL, as well as the anti‑PD‑1 antibody alone (right chart below).

 Activity of mRCT-240 in a B16F10 Lung Metastasis Mouse Model

 Additionally, mRCT‑240 administered i.v. as a monotherapy or in combination with an anti‑PD‑1 antibody reduced tumor burden in a CT26 colon cancer mouse model. Treatment with the combination of mRCT‑240 plus anti‑PD‑1 resulted in a higher number of mice with stable disease or tumor regression compared to mRCT‑240 or anti‑PD‑1 treatment alone. The anti‑tumor activity that was observed after administration of α4‑1BB mAb at the same dose level that generated hepatotoxicity in mice was not significantly different from mRCT‑240. As mRCT‑240 did not generate liver toxicity in mice, we believe that mRCT‑240, if successfully developed and approved, may have an improved therapeutic index, or improved risk‑benefit, over agonistic 4‑1BB antibodies in cancer patients.

 Activity of mRCT-240 in a CT26 Colon Cancer Mouse Model
    
 In summary, we have observed that the combination of 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP on RTX-240 induces potent expansion and activation of CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and key subsets of these cells. In addition, these RTX-240‑mediated effects were much higher than those obtained with utomilumab, rhIL‑15, and a combination of utomilumab and rhIL‑15, suggesting the synergy of the combination on RTX-240 for expanding key cell types from both the adaptive and innate arms of the immune system. This potent activity translated into efficacy of mRCT-240 administered in in vivo cancer models of lung metastasis and colon cancer both as a monotherapy and in combination with an anti‑PD‑1 antibody. mRCT-240 did not generate hepatotoxicity in mice while an agonistic 4‑1BB mAb did. As a result, we believe that co‑expression of 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP on RTX-240, and the sequestration of RTX-240 in the vasculature has the potential to drive potent anti‑tumor activity with an advantageous tolerability profile. We therefore believe that the ability of RTX-240 to stimulate both the innate and adaptive immune systems will translate into therapeutic benefits for patients with solid and hematological cancers.
 Clinical development
 While checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment, their limitations are becoming increasingly evident. Responses are confined to certain tumor types and only a limited portion of patients are cured. Currently, the challenge in immunotherapy is to extend the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors across more tumor types as well as increase the rate and duration of response. By stimulating both arms of the immune system, RTX-240 could be an ideal combination therapy for checkpoint inhibitors to both improve and extend responses.
 The MHC complex is an important nexus in the immune system because it is the way T cells recognize and kill cancer cells but it also blocks the killing function of NK cells. A common means of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors is loss of MHC expression making the cancer invisible to T cells but as a result it becomes susceptible to NK cell dependent killing. Initial clinical development of RTX-240 will include patient populations which have progressed on checkpoint inhibitor therapy due to loss of MHC expression.
 We are currently completing IND-enabling studies and plan to file an IND for RTX-240 for the treatment of solid tumors by early 2020.
 We are planning to evaluate RTX-240 as monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody, including in patients whose disease has progressed on checkpoint inhibitor therapy.  We plan to identify and stratify patients whose disease has lost MHC expression.  Tumor types that may be included are melanoma, non‑small cell lung cancer, renal

cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, and head and neck cancer among others. Success in this population could lead to pivotal studies and development in earlier lines of therapy.
     RTX-240 for hematological cancer: relapsing or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, post‑HSCT
 Current therapies and their limitations
 Acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, is characterized by proliferation of myeloid blasts. They replace the bone marrow so that there is minimal production of platelets, red cells and neutrophils. It is primarily a disease of the elderly with a median age of diagnosis of 68. In 2017, there were more than 20,000 new cases of AML and more than 10,000 deaths caused by AML in the United States.
 Standard first‑line AML treatment has been unchanged for over 40 years: a regimen of intensive induction and consolidation therapy. Although most patients respond, the majority relapse over time. Therefore, many younger patients with AML undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or HSCT, which can be curative if the transplant is successful. In 2016, more than 3,500 AML patients underwent allogeneic‑HSCT in the United States and over 6,200 underwent the procedure in Europe.
 Recently, additional therapies have been approved for treatment of AML, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, CPX‑351, and, for patients with specific mutations, midostaurin and enasidenib. Although these therapies improve response rates and enable more patients to bridge to transplant, overall survival rates remain low.
 Clinical development
 The effectiveness of allogeneic HSCT depends on both the killing of residual tumor by high dose chemotherapy and on graft versus leukemia effects. NK cells are a critical component of the graft versus leukemia effect. After bone marrow ablation and allogeneic transplantation, NK cells are the first lymphocyte population to recover, but their killing and cytokine‑secreting functions are limited when compared to the NK cells of healthy donors. The rate of return and function of NK cells are correlated with treatment outcome post‑allogeneic HSCT, so increasing the number and function of NK cells post‑allogeneic HSCT to stimulate the graft versus leukemia effect has the potential to increase survival in patients receiving allogeneic HSCT for treatment of AML. As discussed above, 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP induce proliferation and maturation of NK cells, supporting the testing of RTX-240 in the post‑allogeneic HSCT setting.
 We plan to evaluate RTX-240 in AML patients post‑allogeneic HSCT using the monotherapy dose determined in our initial Phase 1 trial of RTX-240 in solid tumors. Pending feedback from the FDA, we believe the primary endpoint will be relapse‑free survival.
 Preclinical data for RTX-224
 RTX-224,our second immunotherapy product candidate, has been shown to drive both T cell and NK cell activation and expansion by simultaneously and proximately co-expressing IL-12 and 4-1BBL.  
 Our in vivo studies of a murine surrogate of RTX-224, mRCT-224, administered subcutaneously in an MC38 colon cancer mouse model provide evidence in support of RTX-224’s immune activation and tumor control. In this model, tumor cells were injected to establish growing tumors and then mice were treated with a control mRBC alone, mRCT-224 alone, an anti-PD1 antibody in combination with mRBC-CTRL, or with mRCT-224 in combination with an anti‑PD‑1 antibody. mRCT-224 administered as a monotherapy reduced tumor burden in mice compared to those treated with mRBC‑CTRL with or without and anti-PD1 antibody. Tumor control was even more pronounced when mRCT-224 was combined with an anti-PD1 antibody. These studies support the potential of RTX-224 as a potent monotherapy or combination therapy.

 Activity of mRCT-224 in an MC38 Colon Cancer Mouse Model
    
 The potential of RTX-224 is further illustrated by the number of tumor regressions demonstrated in the same MC38 model. In this case, a regression is defined as a tumor volume below 50 cubic millimeters, as measured on day 11 post randomization.  mRCT-224 administered alone resulted in 5/11 tumor regressions, while mRCT-224 administered in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody resulted in 9/11 tumor regressions. Activity As Measured by Tumor Regression of mRCT-224 in an MC38 Colon Cancer Mouse Model
    
 We saw no evidence of toxicity with mRCT‑224. Levels of interferon gamma, or IFNg, and alanine transaminase, or ALT, were not significantly elevated following administration of mRCT‑224. In contrast, we observed significant interferon gamma and transaminase elevations after administration of recombinant human interleukin 12, or rhIL-12.

Liver Toxicity in Mice of mRCT‑224 Compared to rhIL-12 
    
 Histopathological examination of liver sections from RTX-224 treated mice reveal no macrophage infiltration or tissue inflammation. This is in stark contrast to control mice treated with the murine 4-1BB antibody, 3H3, where significant macrophage infiltration and tissue damage is evident. This difference between the treated and control groups was evident both with and without the co-administration of an anti-PD-1 antibody.

  33

 

 In summary, we have observed that the combination of 4‑1BBL and IL‑12 on RTX-224 induces efficacy in in vivo cancer models both as a monotherapy and in combination with an anti‑PD‑1 antibody. mRCT-224 did not generate hepatotoxicity in mice while the recombinant human cytokine IL-12 did. Nor did mRCT-224 generate liver damage, while a control 4-1BB antibody did. As a result, we believe that co‑expression of 4‑1BBL and IL‑12 on RTX-224, and the sequestration of RTX-224 in the vasculature has the potential to drive potent anti‑tumor activity with an advantageous tolerability profile. We therefore believe that the ability of RTX-224 to stimulate both the innate and adaptive immune systems will translate into therapeutic benefits for patients with solid tumors.
 Clinical development
 While checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment, their limitations are becoming increasingly evident. Responses are confined to certain tumor types and only a limited portion of patients are cured. Currently, the challenge in immunotherapy is to extend the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors across more tumor types as well as increase the rate and duration of response. By stimulating both arms of the immune system, RTX-224 could be an ideal combination therapy for checkpoint inhibitors to both improve and extend responses. 
 IL-12 is known to drive the proliferation of T cells and NK cells.  In turn, these activated T-cells drive antigen presentation.  This antigen presentation may enable us to target formerly non-immunogenic tumors by enhancing their immune signature.
 We are planning to evaluate RX-224 in solid tumors as monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody. We also plan to study RTX-224 in patients whose disease has progressed on checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Success in this population could lead to pivotal studies and development in earlier lines of therapy. 
 RCTs functioning as artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs)
 We have created RCT product candidates that function as artificial APCs, or RTX‑aAPCs, with the potential to induce selective anti‑tumor killing by stimulating the immune system to target tumors in an antigen‑specific manner.
 RCTs permit us to present a variety of proteins in their native state and RTX‑aAPCs take advantage of this as they co‑express an MHC that presents a tumor‑specific peptide, or signal 1, to the immune system together with a costimulatory protein, such as 4‑1BBL, or signal 2, that stimulates the adaptive immune system. When co-expressed and delivered simultaneously and proximately, signal 1+2 promotes T cell activation/initial proliferation and potentially memory. A third cytokine signal can also be added to increase T cell expansion further and support the maintenance of T cell memory.
 The action of the construct described mimics the normal T cell‑APC interaction via the T cell receptor, or TCR, and has shown high levels of T cell expansion and activation in preclinical studies, as well as very specific tumor killing. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells respond to antigens in association with MHC I molecules, and CD4+ helper T cells respond to antigens in association with MHC II molecules. MHC I and MHC II tumor antigen presentation combined with potent co‑stimulation has the potential to generate sustained tumor‑specific killing. Our lead aAPC program targets HPV+ tumors, of which head and neck and cervical cancer are the most common.  Treatment options for refractory and relapsing disease are limited, and we expect to be able to offer patients a potent and highly specific immune stimulation.

     RTX‑aAPCs Mimic the APC‑T Cell Interaction to Provide Antigen Specific Cancer Therapies
    
     We have observed that murine RCT‑MHC I (ovalbumin) co‑expressed with 4‑1BBL on the cell surface, or mRCT‑aAPC (ova), activates ovalbumin‑specific T cells in vitro and in vivo, supporting the ability to potently and selectively expand and activate an antigen‑specific T cell in a dose dependent manner (increasing cell number per dose from right to left in the following charts) using our RCTs.
 Activation of Ovalbumin‑Specific T Cells with mRCT‑aAPC (ova)

 We have also observed that ovalbumin‑specific T cells, or OTI‑T cells, that are expanded and activated by mRCT‑aAPC (ova) selectively kill ovalbumin‑expressing tumor cells, or EG7.OVA cells, while the parental cells that do not express ovalbumin are not attacked and killed.

 
  35

 

 Activity of OT1‑T Cells Expanded With mRCT‑aAPC (ova)

 Furthermore, we have observed in vivo in mice that mRCT‑aAPC (ova) specifically expand and activate OTI‑T cells in circulation and in the spleen. Importantly, we find that the majority of the OTI‑T cells display a central memory phenotype, which has been found to be a key population driving the effectiveness of T cell based therapies. In addition, a large proportion of these cells are found to traffic to lymph nodes, supporting their potential to effectively mobilize within the body and to the tumor to support a robust anti‑tumor response. In contrast, mRCT‑4‑1‑BBL without MHC I (ovalbumin) on the cell surface does not expand or activate OTI‑T cells, thereby indicating that mRCT‑aAPCs mimic the function of antigen presenting cells in vivo.
     Proliferation of OT1‑T Cells Expanded With mRCT‑aAPC (ova) In The Lymph Node and Spleen

 As noted above, OTI‑T cells, that are expanded and activated by mRCT‑aAPC (ova) selectively kill ovalbumin‑expressing tumor cells, or EG7.OVA cells.  In the experiment depicted below, following tumor cell inoculation, animals treated with three doses of mRCT-aAPC (ova) reduced tumor volume compared to those dosed with mRCT-CTRL. Control was maintained upon tumor cell re-challenge at day 35 by EG7.OVA and at day 85 by cells from the EL4 parental cell line, potentially implying the development of broad immunological memory.  Further, there was a statistically significant difference in survival between the treatment and control cohorts.

 
  36

 

 Activity of OT1‑T Cells Expanded With mRCT‑aAPC (ova)

 The ability to significantly expand and activate a tumor specific T cell population to kill tumors in vivo shares characteristics with CAR‑T therapies which administer a tumor specific T cell population that can expand, sometimes uncontrollably, in the patient. By controlling the RTX‑aAPC dose, we believe that we can more effectively control the expansion of the tumor specific T cells and potentially the tolerability and effects of the therapy.
 The potential applications of RTX‑aAPCs span both solid and hematological cancers and there are many known tumor antigens common to certain cancers that can be targeted for development. Over the mid‑term, patient specific antigens can be sequenced to create personalized therapies. We believe that this may provide a more reliable and scalable approach to personalized cellular therapy. In addition to a program in HPV 16+ tumors, we are exploring the use of known tumor antigens, such as EBV, NY‑ESO‑1 and MAGE‑A peptides, as well as tumor neo-antigens to deliver more accessible and effective treatments than standard vaccines or alternative neo‑antigen approaches.
 Cancer discovery research
 Our RED PLATFORM provides significant potential to develop and advance a broad portfolio of RCTs for treatment of cancer. In addition to the lead programs described above, we are evaluating RCT product candidates that target tumors by expressing proteins that bind specifically to known tumor antigens, such as CD19, BCMA CD33, CD38 and CD123. These tumor antigen targeting RCT product candidates can be designed to kill tumors directly, to increase the persistence of existing CAR-T and TCR based therapies, or to starve and thereby kill tumors by degrading metabolites that are critical for tumor proliferation. In addition, we are evaluating a range of combinations of co‑stimulatory ligands, such as OX40‑L, ICOS‑L and GITR‑L, and cytokines, such as IL‑7, IL‑18 and IL‑21. We believe that these approaches may provide therapeutic benefits to patients with solid or hematological cancers.
 Autoimmune diseases
 RCT product candidates for the induction of antigen‑specific tolerance
 We have generated RCT product candidates that express antigens within the cell, on the cell surface, or as presented by major histocompatibility complex II, and we believe that this represents a powerful antigen‑presenting platform for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes. We are also exploring antigen independent approaches that hold the potential to simulate specific regulatory cells which then target a range of autoreactive T cells.  We believe that if successful, this approach will allow us to address a wide range of autoimmune diseases.  
 We are currently assessing several tolerance inducing RCT product candidates and expect to select our first clinical candidate for treatment of autoimmune diseases in 2019. We anticipate that such product candidate will focus on an indication, such as pemphigus vulgaris, where treatment effects are easily measureable and proof-of-concept can be demonstrated in an efficient manner.

 Current therapies and their limitations
 Over the past two decades, considerable progress has been made in the treatment of a range of autoimmune disorders with many patients enjoying an improvement in quality of life as a result. Despite their success, current therapeutic approaches to autoimmune diseases are either generally or specifically immunosuppressive and expose patients to an increased risk of opportunistic infection and hematological cancers, as is the case with JAK inhibitors, anti‑TNF antibodies and anti‑CD20 targeted antibodies. In up to one third of cases, patients with autoimmune diseases fail to respond to treatment, and most responding patients ultimately lose response over time.
 While the triggers of most autoimmune diseases remain unknown, it is generally understood that clinical disease is the result of a loss of tolerance to one’s own cells. The accepted model of disease assumes a genetic susceptibility triggered by an environmental event, which leads to a breakdown of T cell‑mediated immune suppression. In principle, restoration of peripheral tolerance should provide patients with a partial or complete cure.
 A range of competitive approaches to peripheral tolerance restoration have been investigated over the last few decades. These include the oral administration and direct injection of a protein or peptide with or without immunosuppression, the creation of peptide bearing nanoparticles and the adoptive transfer of engineered regulatory T cells. Thus far, these approaches have not proven to be successful in late‑stage clinical trials, but the field continues to progress. Direct administration of peptides and nanoparticles suffer biodistribution, stability, presentation and orientation challenges which limit the effectiveness of cell‑cell signaling. To date, adoptive transfer approaches are all autologous and are hampered by some of the same handling and scalability issues that limit the application of other cellular therapies. By contrast, RCT breakdown by antigen presenting cells in the liver is thought to recapitulate the normal process of self / non‑self recognition training that would lead to tolerance induction. When compared with contemporary and historical approaches of tolerance induction, RCTs could represent a clinically meaningful step forward.
 Preclinical data
 In a commonly used preclinical mouse model of neurodegeneration, the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, or EAE model, we have observed induction of peripheral tolerance using a murine RCT displaying the model‑specific antigen associated with neuronal demyelination, the MOG 35‑55 peptide. In the experiment depicted below, murine RCT‑MOG, or mRCT‑MOG, and control mouse RBCs were administered to mice at a disease score of one. The mRCT‑MOG‑treated animals were brought back to an average disease score of zero, while control animals continued to progress to limited disability. More significantly, as depicted in the second experiment, following treatment with mRCT‑MOG and control mouse RBCs at a disease score of three, indicating that the animals were paralyzed, we observed a remarkable recovery curve following treatment with murine RCT‑MOG. In effect, mice exhibiting paralysis were made to walk again.

 Upon examination of the histopathology, the difference in the damage to spinal cord tissue between the control and treated mice was notable. In addition, treatment with mRCT‑MOG cells was found to dramatically reduce the infiltration of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 CD4+ cells that have been shown to drive disease progression.
 Effect of mRCT‑MOG on Th1 and Th17 Cells in the Spinal Cord in EAE Mice

 In further preclinical studies in EAE mice, we observed that mouse RBCs and mRCT‑MOG cells are taken up by antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DC) and Kupffer cells within the liver, and that mRCT‑MOG upregulates PD‑L1, an immunosuppressive marker, on APCs, while control mouse RBCs do not. The above findings suggest that red blood cell uptake into APCs promotes an immunosuppressive phenotype that then drives the reduction in pathogenic Th1 and Th17 T cells in the spinal cord, thereby providing evidence for the mechanism of action for RCT‑driven tolerance induction.
 Effect of mRCT‑MOG in Immunosuppressive on the Phenotype of APCs in EAE Mice

 Beyond observations of therapeutic effects in this disease model, we have generated evidence of the development of immunologic memory following treatment with mRCT‑MOG, suggesting the possibility of a cure. Using the EAE animal model, mice were first treated with either mRCT‑MOG or control mouse RBCs on Days 5 and 17. Following a 40‑day washout period after which the administered mouse RBCs were no longer in circulation, the EAE mice were re‑challenged with MOG peptide to re‑stimulate an immune response. We observed a clear improvement in survival between the mRCT‑MOG treated group and the control group, indicating that RCT‑MOG treated animals maintained immunological memory which protected them from the re‑challenge.

 Survival of Previously mRCT‑MOG Treated EAE Mice After a Second MOG Challenge

 The ability of antigen‑presenting RBCs to drive tolerance induction in a preclinical model of Type 1 diabetes was recently demonstrated by our collaborators, Professors Hidde Ploegh and Harvey Lodish. In their study, NOD/ShiltJ mice, a strain genetically engineered to develop Type 1 diabetes after 10 to 13 weeks, were either treated with control RBCs or with RBCs that displayed a peptide consisting of the amino acids 9‑23 of insulin B‑chain on the cell surface. All mice receiving control RBCs became hyperglycemic while most mice receiving RBCs displaying the insulin peptide were protected from Type 1 diabetes onset and remained normoglycemic.
 Overall, we and our collaborators have generated compelling preclinical evidence in support of applying antigen‑expressing RCT product candidates to induce antigen‑specific tolerance for the treatment of a range of autoimmune diseases.
 Autoimmune disease discovery research
 Beyond developing RCTs that express one or more antigens for the treatment in antigen‑induced autoimmune diseases, we are exploring the potential to apply RCT product candidates to stimulate specific populations of regulatory T cells directly and direct the immune system back to a more tolerogenic state. We have also created RCT constructs that clear lethal doses of TNF‑alpha and botulinum toxin from the bloodstream of mice, suggesting that RCTs may also provide therapeutic benefits to patients suffering from severe inflammatory diseases.
 Manufacturing
 We have industrialized the production of RCTs by developing and scaling up a manufacturing process by which hematopoietic progenitor cells are expanded, then genetically engineered and subsequently differentiated and matured into fully enucleated RCTs that express biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface. Our standard RCT manufacturing process includes the following steps:
 (1)Donors are screened for infectious diseases according to regulatory guidelines and are typed for major blood group antigens. O negative blood donors are selected and administered granulocyte colony stimulating factor to mobilize their bone marrow.
 (2)CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells are isolated from universal donor blood, collected by apheresis and purified.

 
  40

 

 (3)These precursor cells are expanded and then transduced using a lentiviral vector encoding one or more chosen biotherapeutic proteins.
 (4)The cells are then exposed to a defined media formulation to promote further expansion and differentiation until they differentiate and mature into enucleated reticulocytes. At this stage, the enucleated reticulocytes are RCTs that express one or more biotherapeutic proteins in the cytosol or on the cell surface.
 (5)The RCTs are purified to separate the mature RCTs from nucleated erythroid precursor cells, formulated  and stored at 4°C or frozen.
 A single donor will allow us to manufacture up to thousands of doses. With approximately 7% of the U.S. population having an O negative blood type, we believe that there is ample supply of CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells needed to produce our RCTs. Additionally, due to the inherent properties of RBCs, RCTS can be manufactured in large bioreactors using our proprietary cell culture processes, which could result in the cost of goods sold being significantly lower than other cellular therapies.
 The FDA has reviewed our RCT manufacturing process, including in‑process control parameters. Based on guidance from the FDA, we have established a path to production of current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, grade product candidates for clinical use. We expect to be able to use the same or similar manufacturing processes for all our future RCT product candidates, which would enable us to bring RCTs into clinical development in an accelerated manner.
 Based on our expertise in red cell biology and advice from leading hematologists and blood transfusion experts, we have developed RCT product release criteria to determine the purity, viability, red cell identity and potency of each RCT batch. These release criteria have been reviewed and accepted for clinical use by the FDA.
 We are manufacturing RCTs in single use bioreactors, which enable us to control critical process parameters and thereby produce consistent RCTs that meet the established product release criteria. We currently use external suppliers for lentiviral vector production but have established an internal lentiviral vector production process. We are currently working to further increase yields and to scale into larger bioreactors.
 In addition to the standard RCT manufacturing process, we have developed alternative proprietary processes for engineering hematopoietic precursor cells and maturing these into RCTs. These processes may be utilized in the production of future RCTs.
 Suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations
 We have entered into a clinical supply agreement with a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, located in the United States to produce cGMP grade RTX‑134 for our initial clinical trials and have successfully transferred our manufacturing process to this CMO. We have secured options for additional manufacturing suites for cGMP production of the RCT product candidates that are projected to begin clinical trials in 2020. We anticipate that these arrangements will be sufficient for the manufacture of our product candidates until our planned manufacturing facility is established and operational.
 We have also entered into agreements with a supplier of cGMP grade plasmids for lentiviral production as well as a supplier of lentiviral vector. We have secured cGMP lentiviral vector production slots that we believe will be sufficient to supply RTX‑134 drug product for our planned Phase 1b trial in PKU patients, and we are continually securing additional lentiviral production slots for the additional RCT product candidates that are projected to enter clinical trials.
 Expanding our manufacturing capacity and supply chain
 In 2018, we acquired a 135,000 square foot GMP manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island. We are in the process of renovating and customizing this facility to contain multiple RCT GMP manufacturing suites and lentiviral vector GMP manufacturing suites. This will enable us to manufacture multiple RCTs as well as lentiviral vectors in a cGMP compliant manner for the clinical supply and, if approved, expand capacity for commercial supply of our RCT

product candidates. We plan to utilize this facility to provide clinical supply for the pivotal trial of RTX‑134 and in parallel provide clinical supply for additional clinical trials with other RCT product candidates.

 Additional oncology intellectual property
 We own disease‑related patent applications directed to RCTs for use in oncology, including immuno‑oncology. These patent applications relate to RCT compositions that comprise a variety of agents, including anti‑tumor antibodies, tumor starvation enzymes, pro‑apoptotic proteins, costimulatory molecules, immune checkpoint inhibitors, tumor antigens, MHC molecules and numerous combinations thereof. These patent applications also cover the use of RCTs to treat cancer, including lung cancer, melanoma, renal cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, as well as various relapsed or refractory cancers.
 These disease‑related patent applications include patent applications directed to RCTs that function as artificial antigen‑presenting cells. These applications cover RCTs expressing combinations of MHC, antigen and a costimulatory molecule, methods of activating an antigen‑specific T cell and methods of treating cancer by inducing a tumor‑specific immune response.
 We expect the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2038, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
 Autoimmune disease intellectual property
 We own disease‑related patent applications directed to RCTs for use in treating autoimmune diseases. These patent applications relate to RCT compositions having autoimmune antigens, anti‑cytokine antibodies, agents for cleaving autoimmune antibodies and numerous combinations thereof. The RCTs covered by these patent applications operate through various mechanisms, including through induction of tolerance to self‑antigens, clearance of autoimmune antibodies from the bloodstream, clearance of cytokines from the bloodstream and inactivation of autoimmune antibodies. The patent applications also cover the use of these RCTs to treat a number of diseases, such as pemphigus vulgaris, Type 1 diabetes, membranous nephropathy, autoimmune hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease and neuromyelitis optica.
 We expect the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire between 2035 and 2038, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
 Cardio‑metabolic disorders intellectual property
 We own a disease‑related PCT application directed to RCT compositions and their use in treating cardiac disorders and metabolic disorders, including diabetes, obesity heart failure, atherosclerosis and hemophilia. We expect that any national phase patent applications filed in connection with this PCT application, if issued, to expire in 2037, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.

 Infectious disease intellectual property
 We own disease‑related patent applications directed to RCT compositions and their use in treating infectious diseases, such as a viral infection (e.g., cytomegalovirus or HIV) or a bacterial infection (e.g., bacteremia). We expect the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire between 2037 and 2039 without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
 Platform‑related intellectual property
 In addition to the disease‑related intellectual property, our intellectual property portfolio also includes know‑how and patent applications directed to the RED PLATFORM and other technologies developed internally and exclusively in‑licensed from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, or WIBR, that relate to the engineering and culturing of RCTs. Exemplary platform technologies that are the subject of such patent applications include:
 •methods related to the in vitro production of enucleated red blood cells;
 •gene editing and transcriptional modulation systems for engineering RCTs;
 •targeted lipid nanoparticle compositions and RNA delivery techniques;
 •amplifiable nucleic acid constructs for optimizing protein production;
 •methods for chemically conjugating biotherapeutic proteins to cell surfaces; and
 •methods for increasing percent enucleation during RCT production.
 These platform technologies, and our intellectual property protection related thereto, are broadly applicable to our RCT product candidates.
 We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new platform technologies and product candidates. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications if our intellectual property strategy requires such filings, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, relating to the new technologies that we develop. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we often file counterpart patent applications in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including but not limited to Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel and Japan.
 Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product‑by‑product basis, from country‑to‑country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory‑related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 Trademark protection
 As of February 28, 2019, our trademark portfolio contains approximately 38 registrations and pending applications. For the RUBIUS THERAPEUTICS mark, we have pending applications in the United States, Canada and Brazil, as well as an International Registration designating China, the E.U., India, Japan and Russia.

Finally, we have pending U.S. applications for the RTX mark and the REALIZING THE POWER OF RED mark.
 Trade secrets
 We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology and aspects of our platform. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know‑how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section on “Risk factors—Risks related to intellectual property.”
 Licenses
 In January 2016, we entered into an exclusive license with WIBR that grants us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under patent rights comprising two patent families to research, develop, make and commercialize products and processes covered by such patent rights for all uses, or the WIBR License. The WIBR License also includes an option to for us to exclusively negotiate with WIBR for a license to certain improvement technologies related to the licensed subject matter. The WIBR License was amended in December 2017 to grant us an exclusive license to the commercialization rights under a third patent family jointly owned by WIBR and Tufts University, or Tufts. The WIBR License was amended in July 2018 to grant us an exclusive license to the commercialization rights under a fourth patent family owned by WIBR. As of February 28, 2019, the patent portfolio licensed from WIBR consists of one allowed U.S. patent application, and a total of 13 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We expect these WIBR‑licensed patent applications, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2038, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions that may be obtained.
 The patent rights licensed to us under the WIBR License are directed, in part, to the in vitro production of RBCs and the use of the enzyme sortase to conjugate a protein of interest to the cell surface. We have certain diligence obligations under the WIBR License, which include using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize any products under the patents and achieving certain milestones as further described in the WIBR License. Additionally, under certain circumstances, we may in the future be obligated to negotiate in good faith field‑limited, non‑exclusive sublicenses to allow third parties to exploit the patent rights licensed to us under the WIBR License to develop and commercialize products that are not competitive with our products or product candidates.
 WIBR retains the right with respect to all four patent families licensed to us to (i) to practice the patent rights licensed under the agreement for research, teaching and educational purposes, including sponsored research and collaboration, and (ii) to grant non‑exclusive licenses to academic and not‑for‑profit research institutes to practice under the patent rights for research, teaching and educational purposes (excluding sponsored research), while Tufts retains such rights only with respect to the patent family that it co‑owns. Pursuant to a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency agreement between WIBR and a global biopharmaceutical company, the biopharmaceutical company funded research resulting in one of the licensed patent families and WIBR granted the right to retain a worldwide, irrevocable, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free right to use this patent family for research and development purposes. In addition, under the 

 
  46

 
WIBR agreement, the U.S. federal government retains a royalty‑free, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to practice any government‑funded invention claimed in the patent rights, as set forth in 35 U.S.C. §§ 201‑211 and Executive Order 12591.
 As partial consideration for the license, we issued 366,667 shares of our common stock to WIBR. In addition, we paid WIBR an upfront payment and are required to pay annual license maintenance fees, creditable against royalties and milestone payments. We are obligated to pay to WIBR low single‑digit royalties based on annual net sales by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees of licensed products and licensed services that are covered by a valid claim of the licensed patent rights at the time and in the country of sale. On a country‑by‑country basis, upon expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering such licensed product or licensed service in such country, our license becomes royalty‑free, perpetual and irrevocable with respect to such country. Based on the progress we make in the advancement of products covered by the licensed patent rights, we are required to make aggregate milestone payments of up to $1.6 million upon the achievement of specified preclinical, clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, we are required to pay to WIBR a percentage of the non‑royalty payments that we receive from sublicensees of the patent rights licensed to us by WIBR. This percentage varies from low single digits to low double digits and will be based upon the clinical stage of the product at the time of the sublicense.
 Under the WIBR License, WIBR controls the prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights licensed to us and we have the right to review and comment on such prosecution and maintenance. We have the first right to enforce the patent rights licensed to us against third party infringers. We may terminate the WIBR License for convenience upon three months prior written notice to WIBR. WIBR may terminate the WIBR License upon written notice to us if we, along with our affiliates and sublicensees, cease to carry on business related to the WIBR License for more than six months. WIBR may terminate the WIBR License for our material breach that remains uncured for sixty days after receiving notice thereof, if we fail to pay amounts due under the agreement within thirty days after receiving notice of such failure, or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patent rights.
 Competition
 In addition to the product specific competitors that are described for each of the initial targets we are pursuing, we have identified four companies that are leveraging the RBC as a platform. Erytech Pharma SA is using hypotonic enzyme loading to create products for use in cancer, rare diseases and immunology. The company has completed a successful Phase 3 program in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, recently failed a Phase 2 trial in acute myeloid leukemia, and completed a successful Phase 2 program in pancreatic cancer. We believe that there are three fundamental challenges with hypotonic loading:
 •The hypotonic loading process may be challenging to scale as it requires delivery of hypotonically loaded blood to the patient within 72 hours of acquisition of the blood. Thus, while not autologous, it suffers from many of the shortcomings of autologous therapy.
 •Therapeutic interventions are limited to agents that can be loaded into, as opposed to expressed on, the cell surface of RBCs.
 •Hypotonic loading may damage the cell and impact circulating half‑life.
 There are three other companies that rely on loading of mature RBCs: Orphan Technologies Ltd., which is developing a range of products aimed at rare diseases; EryDel SpA, which is in late‑stage development of dexamethasone loaded RBCs for the treatment of ataxia telangiectasia; and SQZ Biotechnologies, which is pursuing preclinical applications in cancer, enzyme replacement therapy and immune tolerance. Taking an alternative approach, Kanyos Bio, Inc. and Anokion SA are developing proteins that, when injected, fuse in vivo to the RBC binding peptide glycophorin A. The applications are preclinical, with a focus on peripheral tolerance induction.
 Outside of RBC‑based competition, there are companies developing engineered enzymes and specializing in rare diseases, such as Codexis, Inc., which has a product candidate in Phase 1 development for the treatment of PKU and Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc., which has a product candidate in a Phase 1 trial for the treatment of hyperargininemia. 

 
  47

 
There are a number of gene therapy companies, such as BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc., which has active gene therapy programs that include a preclinical PKU product candidate, and Homology Medicines, Inc., which recently declared that it is in IND‑enabling studies with a gene therapy product candidate and expects to initiate a clinical trial in PKU in the first quarter of 2019. Moderna, Inc. is in early preclinical work with an mRNA approach to addressing PKU. In addition, Synlogic, Inc. is one of several companies developing engineered probiotic therapeutics to treat inborn errors of metabolism and has a product candidate in a Phase 1 trial for the treatment of urea cycle disorders, as well as a Phase 1/2 program for the treatment of PKU. Finally, Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. declared that they are in the early discovery stage with a small molecule approach to PKU treatment. In addition, we anticipate competing with the largest biopharmaceutical companies in the world, such as Novartis AG, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Amgen, Inc., F. Hoffman‑La Roche AG (Roche), Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer Inc., which are all currently conducting research in cellular therapies.
 Government regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record‑keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such RTX‑134 and RTX-240, and any future product candidates. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
 U.S. biological product development 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and regulations thereunder. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post‑market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 The FDA categorizes human cell‑ or tissue‑based products as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated, and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial‑related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
 •submission to the FDA of a BLA;

 
  48

 

 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre‑approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and, if applicable, current Good Tissue Practices, or cGTP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biological product in the United States.
 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for RTX‑134 and RTX-240 and any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 Preclinical studies and IND
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety and toxicology studies.
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold before such time. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. If the FDA’s concerns are not resolved, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but a RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process.
 In addition to the IND submission process, sponsors of certain clinical studies of cells containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, including human gene transfer studies, must comply with the NIH’s Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. The NIH Guidelines set forth the principles and requirements for NIH and institutional oversight of research with recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, including the standards for investigators and institutions to follow to ensure the safe handling and containment of such molecules. In April 2016, modifications to the NIH Guidelines went into effect, pursuant to which only a subset of human gene transfer protocols are subject to review by the RAC. Specifically, under the modified NIH Guidelines, RAC review of the protocol will be required only in exceptional cases where an oversight body such as an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, which provides local review and oversight of research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, or an IRB determines that the protocol would significantly benefit from RAC review, and the protocol (a) uses a new vector, genetic material, or delivery methodology that represents a first‑in‑human experience and thus presents an unknown risk, and/or (b) relies on preclinical safety data that were obtained using a new preclinical model system of unknown and unconfirmed value, and/or (c) involves a proposed vector, gene construct, or method of delivery associated with possible toxicities that are not widely known and that may render it difficult for oversight bodies to evaluate the protocol rigorously. The RAC review proceedings are public, and reports are posted publicly to the website for the NIH’s Office of Biotechnology Activities. Although compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for research conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. Independent of RAC review, the NIH Guidelines also require all human gene transfer protocols subject to the NIH Guidelines to be registered with NIH, with limited exemptions. A study subject to the NIH Guidelines may not begin until the IBC approves the protocol, and the IBC cannot approve the 

 
  49

 
protocol until confirmation from the NIH that such registration is complete. In the event that RAC review is warranted, the protocol registration process cannot be completed until RAC review has taken place.
 Clinical trials
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA or NDA. The FDA will accept a well‑designed and well‑conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.
 •Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease‑affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
 •Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease‑affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit and risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
 Post‑approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or 

 
  50

 
terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, among other things. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
 BLA and FDA review process
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, a request for approval to market the biological product for one or more specified indications, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company‑sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through December 31, 2018, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA or NDA, is $2,421,495. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual prescription drug program fee, which for fiscal year 2018 is $304,162. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non‑orphan indication.
 The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre‑approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements and, if applicable, cGTP requirements. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their products with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and cGTP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as 

 
  51

 
to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data as part of the review process, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the process.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The CRL may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) or other significant and time‑consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre‑ and post‑marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post‑market studies or surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post‑marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
 Orphan drug designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances. A product will not be considered the “same drug” if it is clinically superior to a product that has orphan drug exclusivity. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication, but which could be used off‑label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity.

 Expedited development and review programs
 The FDA has several programs that are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre‑BLA meeting.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life‑threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life‑threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well‑controlled post‑marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post‑marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.
 Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life‑threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive interaction and guidance from the FDA. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. All requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and FDA will either grant or deny the request.
 Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress recently amended the FDCA to create an accelerated approval pathway for certain regenerative medicine therapies, which include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. Regenerative medicine therapies do not include those human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue based products regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR Part 1271. The new program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of RMATs, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition.
 A sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug as an RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition. The FDA generally expects preliminary clinical evidence to be obtained from clinical investigations specifically conducted to assess the effects of the therapy on a serious condition, which could 

 
  53

 
include well‑designed retrospective studies or clinical case series, as appropriate, but the RMAT designation does not require evidence to indicate that the drug may offer a substantial improvement over existing therapies. Advantages of RMAT designation include all of the benefits of the fast track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with sponsors. In addition, a product that receives RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review, and the FDA may grant accelerated approval to products that have RMAT designation based on (1) previously agreed‑upon surrogate or intermediate endpoints that are reasonably likely to predict long‑term clinical benefit; or (2) reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites, as appropriate. Another benefit of RMAT designation is that may enable to the sponsor to meet post‑approval requirements beyond the completion of traditional confirmatory clinical trials. The FDA has indicated that post‑approval requirements for RMATs receiving accelerated approval can potentially be met through:
 •Clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records;
 •The collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or
 •Post‑approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to approval of the therapy.
 As with breakthrough designation, an RMAT designation is not the same as an approval and does not change the statutory standards for demonstration of safety and effectiveness needed for marketing approval.
 Pediatric information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain BLAs and certain supplements to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end‑of‑Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric trial or trials that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed‑upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early‑phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
 Post‑marketing requirements
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record‑keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off‑label use”) and limitations on industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off‑label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A 

 
  54

 
REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non‑compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 FDA regulations require that biological products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations and, in some cases, cGTP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP and cGTP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP and cGTP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP or cGTP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and, if applicable, cGTP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP and cGTP compliance. Other post‑approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record‑keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
 After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHS Act also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States.
 Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and, if applicable, cGTP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

 U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of RTX‑134, RTX-240 and RTX-224 and any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch‑Waxman Amendments. The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent‑term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent‑term restoration period is generally one‑half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
 An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA‑licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the ACA. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Bio similarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 A reference biological product is granted four and twelve year exclusivity periods from the time of first licensure of the product. The FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case‑by‑case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA‑issued “Written Request” for such a trial.

 European Union drug development
 In the E.U., our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the E.U. are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the E.U. Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the E.U. clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the E.U., the E.U. Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the E.U. countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs.
 The E.U. clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical trial authorization, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation E.U. No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the E.U. will be identical.
 European Union drug marketing
 Much like the Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States discussed below, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti‑bribery laws of E.U. Member States, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
 Payments made to physicians in certain E.U. Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and the regulatory authorities of the individual E.U. Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the E.U. Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
 European Union drug review and approval
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of all 28 E.U. Member States (except Croatia) and also Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations.
 •The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced‑therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue‑engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the E.U.
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a 

 
  57

 
National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk‑benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 European Union new chemical entity exclusivity
 In the E.U., new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the E.U. from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten‑year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies.
 European Union orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 In the E.U., the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life‑threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the E.U. community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).
 In the E.U., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 European data collection
 The collection and use of personal health data in the E.U. is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and as of May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR. This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive and the GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the E.U. to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the E.U. Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the E.U. and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial 

 
  58

 
condition, results of operations and prospects. For more information related to GDPR, please see “Risk Factors—Risks related to government regulation—European data collection is governed by restrictive regulations governing the use, processing, and cross-border transfer of personal information.”
 Rest of the world regulation
 For other countries outside of the E.U. and the United States, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Additional laws and regulations governing international operations
 If we further expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.
 Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non‑U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.
     The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The Securities and Exchange Commission also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions.
 Coverage and reimbursement
 Successful commercialization of new drug and biologic products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for those drug and biologic products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. These bodies decide which drug and biologic products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford a drug or biologic product. Sales of drug and biologic products depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of these products are paid for by health maintenance, 

 
  59

 
managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third‑party payors.
     In the United States, the important decisions about reimbursement for new drug and biologic products are made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, as well as major health insurers. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug and biologic products exists among third‑party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for drug and biologic products can differ significantly from payor to payor.
     The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug and biologic benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs and biologics. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs and biologics, and each drug plan can develop its own formulary that identifies which drugs and biologics it will cover, and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include products within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs and biologics in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs and biologics may increase demand for products for which we obtain marketing approval. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non‑governmental payors.
     For a drug or biologic product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the average manufacturer price, or AMP, and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of children’s hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. Further, on December 27, 2018, the District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated a recent reimbursement formula change instituted by CMS under the 340B program.  It is unclear how this decision could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our products in the future, and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third‑party payors do not consider our products to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
     These current laws and state and federal healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
    
 
  60

 

 Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control as part of national health systems in many countries. In general, the prices of drug and biologic products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for drug and biologic products, but monitor and control company profits. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States.
     Other healthcare laws
     Healthcare providers, physicians and third party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Arrangements with third party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose a pharmaceutical or biologics manufacturer to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti‑kickback, false claims, physician transparency and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below:
 •the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug or biologic manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit receive, offer or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violation of the statute does not require actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
 •the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil “qui tam” or “whistleblower” actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making or causing a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay money to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing such an obligation. Similar to the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation;
 •the federal anti-inducement law, prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;
 •the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;

 •the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices;
 •the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the HHS under the Open Payments Program, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
 •analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state and foreign anti‑kickback, false claims, consumer protection and unfair competition laws which may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements as well as submitting claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical and biologics manufacturers to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug and biologic manufacturers to file reports with states regarding pricing and marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Efforts to ensure that business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, integrity and oversight agreements to resolve allegations of non‑compliance, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. In addition, commercialization of any of our products outside the United States will also likely be subject to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.
 Current and future healthcare reform legislation
 In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In particular, in 2010 the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
 There have been a number of significant changes to the ACA and its implementation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision effective January 1, 2019 repealing the tax‑based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Trump administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the same judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. It is unclear how

this decision and any subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. We continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act and its possible repeal and replacement could have on our business.
 Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost‑sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. Moreover, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA‑mandated fees, including the so called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer‑sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non‑exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point‑of‑sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” which will shift costs for name brand drugs away from Part D participants back to the manufacturers, which could have a negative effect on our profits in the event any of our products receive FDA approval and CMS reimbursement. Similarly, CMS recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. On November 30, 2018, CMS announced a proposed rule that would amend the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow Medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs. Among other things, the proposed rule changes would allow Medicare Advantage plans to use pre-authorization, or PA, and step therapy, or ST, for six protected classes of drugs, with certain exceptions, permit plans to implement PA and ST in Medicare Part B drugs, change the definition of "negotiated prices," and add a definition of "price concession" to the regulations.  It is unclear whether these proposed changes we be accepted, and if so, what effect such changes will have on our business.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Legislative and regulatory proposals, and enactment of laws, at the foreign, federal and state levels, directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, will continue into the future.
