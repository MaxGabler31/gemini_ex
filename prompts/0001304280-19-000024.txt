Item 1. Business 
Overview
Novelis is the leading producer of flat rolled aluminum products and the world's largest recycler of aluminum. We work alongside our customers to provide innovative solutions to the beverage can, automotive and high-end specialty markets. Operating an integrated network of technically advanced rolling and recycling facilities across North America, South America, Europe and Asia, Novelis leverages its global manufacturing and recycling footprint to consistently deliver high-quality products around the world. In fiscal year 2019, we had shipment volumes of 3,419 kt and "Net sales" of $12,326 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. 
Our History
Organization and Description of Business
Novelis was formed in Canada on September 21, 2004. On May 15, 2007, Novelis was acquired by Hindalco. All of the common shares of Novelis are owned directly by AV Metals Inc. and indirectly by Hindalco. We produce flat rolled aluminum products and provide innovative solutions to the beverage can, automotive and high-end specialty markets. As of March 31, 2019, we had manufacturing operations in ten countries on four continents: North America, South America, Europe and Asia, through 23 operating facilities, including recycling operations in twelve of these plants. 
Our Industry
The aluminum rolled products market represents the global supply of, and demand for, aluminum sheet, plate and foil produced either from sheet ingot or continuously cast roll-stock in rolling mills operated by both independent aluminum rolled products producers and integrated aluminum companies.
Aluminum rolled products are semi-finished aluminum products that constitute the raw material for the manufacture of finished goods ranging from automotive structures and body panels to food and beverage cans. There are two major types of manufacturing processes for aluminum rolled products differing mainly in the process used to achieve the initial stage of processing:

• | hot mills — which require sheet ingot, a rectangular slab of aluminum, as starter material; and


• | continuous casting mills — which can convert molten metal directly into semi-finished sheet.

 Both processes require subsequent rolling, which we refer to as cold rolling, and finishing steps such as annealing, coating, leveling or slitting to achieve the desired thickness, width and metal properties. Most customers receive shipments in the form of aluminum coil, a large roll of metal, which can be utilized in their fabrication processes.
Industry Sources of Metal
There are two sources of input material: (1) recycled aluminum, produced by remelting post-industrial and post-consumer scraps; and (2) primary aluminum, produced from alumina (extracted from bauxite), processed in a smelter.
Primary aluminum and sheet ingot can generally be purchased at prices set on the LME, plus a local market premium that varies by geographic region of delivery, alloying material, form (ingot or molten metal) and purity. 
Recycled aluminum is generally purchased at a discount compared to the price of primary aluminum depending on type and quality of the scrap, geographic region, and other market factors. 
Industry End-use Markets
Aluminum rolled products companies produce and sell a wide range of products, which can be grouped into five end-use markets: (1) packaging; (2) transportation; (3) architectural; (4) industrial; and (5) consumer durables and other. Within each end-use market, aluminum rolled products are manufactured with a variety of alloy mixtures; a range of tempers (hardness), gauges (thickness) and widths; and various coatings and finishes. Large customers typically have customized needs that require close working relationships, including technical development and support with their supplying mills.
Aluminum has a wide variety of uses in end-use markets because of its lightweight, recyclability and formability properties. The recyclability of aluminum enables it to be used, collected, melted and returned to the original product form an unlimited number of times, unlike paper and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, which deteriorate with every iteration of recycling.

Packaging. Aluminum is used in beverage cans and bottles, food cans, beverage screw caps and foil, among others. Packaging is the largest aluminum rolled products application, according to market data from Commodity Research Unit International Limited (CRU), an independent business analysis and consultancy group. Beverage cans are one of the largest aluminum rolled products applications. In addition to their recyclability, aluminum beverage cans offer advantages in fabricating efficiency and product shelf life. Fabricators are able to produce and fill beverage cans at very high speeds, and non-porous aluminum cans provide longer shelf life than PET plastic containers. Additionally, the use of aluminum to package beverages such as craft beer is increasing, as aluminum blocks sunlight and therefore maintains the quality and taste of the product longer. Aluminum cans are light, stackable and use space efficiently, making them convenient and cost-efficient to ship.
Beverage can sheet is sold in coil form for the production of can bodies, ends and tabs. The material can be ordered as rolled, degreased, pre-lubricated, pre-treated and/or lacquered. Typically, can makers define their own specifications for material to be delivered in terms of alloy, gauge, width and surface finish.
Foil wrap or packaging foil is another packaging application and it includes household and institutional aluminum foil. Container foil is used to produce semi-rigid containers such as pie plates and take-out food trays.
Transportation. Aluminum rolled products are used in vehicle structures (also known as "body-in-white") as well as automotive body panel applications, including hoods, doors, deck lids, fenders and lift gates. These uses typically result from cooperative efforts between aluminum rolled products manufacturers and their customers that yield solutions for specific requirements in alloy selection, fabrication procedure, surface quality and joining. There has been recent growth in certain geographic markets in passenger and commercial vehicle applications due to the lighter weight, better fuel economy and improved emissions performance associated with these applications. We expect increased growth in this end-use market driven by government regulations requiring improved emissions and better fuel economy; while also maintaining or improving vehicle performance and safety.
Heat exchangers, such as radiators, air conditioners, and auto fin material, are an important application for aluminum rolled products in the transportation end-use market. Original equipment manufacturers also use aluminum sheet, with specially treated surfaces and other specific properties, for interior and exterior applications. Newly developed alloys are being used in transportation tanks and rigid containers allowing for safer and more economical transportation of hazardous and corrosive materials.
Aluminum is also used in aerospace applications, as well as in the construction of ships’ hulls, superstructures and passenger rail cars because of its strength, light weight, formability and corrosion resistance.
Architectural. Construction is the largest application within this end-use market. Aluminum rolled products developed for the construction industry are often decorative and non-flammable, offer insulating properties, are durable and corrosion resistant, and have a high strength-to-weight ratio. Aluminum siding, gutters, and downspouts comprise a significant amount of construction volume. Other applications include doors, windows, awnings, canopies, facades, roofs and ceilings.
Industrial. Industrial applications include heat exchangers, process and electrical machinery, lighting fixtures, furniture and insulation. 
Consumer Durables and Other. Aluminum’s lightweight characteristics, high formability, ability to conduct electricity and dissipate heat and its corrosion resistance makes it useful in a wide variety of electronic applications. Uses of aluminum rolled products in electronics include flat screen televisions, personal computers, laptops, mobile devices, and digital music players. Other uses of aluminum rolled products in consumer durables include microwaves, coffee makers, air conditioners and cooking utensils.

The factors influencing competition vary by region and end-use market, but generally we compete on the basis of our value proposition; which includes price, product quality, the ability to meet customers’ specifications, range of products offered, lead times, technical support and customer service. In some end-use markets, competition is also affected by fabricators’ requirements that suppliers complete a qualification process to supply their plants. This process can be rigorous and may take many months to complete. As a result, obtaining business from these customers can be a lengthy and expensive process. However, the ability to obtain and maintain these qualifications can represent a competitive advantage.
In addition to competition from others within the aluminum rolled products industry, we also face competition from non-aluminum material producers. In the packaging end-use market (primarily beverage and food cans), aluminum rolled products compete mainly with glass, PET plastic, and in some regions, steel. In the transportation end-use market, aluminum rolled products compete mainly with steel and composites. Aluminum competes with wood, plastic, cement, steel and other materials in building products applications. In the consumer durables end-use market, aluminum rolled products compete mainly with plastic, steel, and magnesium. Additionally, aluminum competes with steel, copper, plastic, glass and other materials in industrial applications. Factors affecting competition with substitute materials include price, ease to manufacture, consumer preference and performance characteristics.

Key Factors Affecting Supply and Demand
The following factors have historically affected the supply of aluminum rolled products:
Production Capacity and Alternative Technology. The addition of rolling capacity requires large capital investments and significant plant construction or expansion, and typically requires long lead-time equipment orders. Advances in technological capabilities allow aluminum rolled products producers to better align product portfolios and supply with industry demand. There are lower cost ways to enter the industry such as continuous casting, which offers the ability to increase capacity in smaller increments than is possible with hot mill additions; however, the continuous casting process results in a more limited range of products.
Trade. Some trade flows occur between regions despite shipping costs, import duties and the lack of localized customer support. Higher value-added products are more likely to be traded internationally, especially if demand in certain markets exceeds local supply. With respect to less technically demanding applications, emerging markets with low cost inputs may export commodity aluminum rolled products to larger, more mature markets, as we have seen with China.
The following factors have historically affected the demand for aluminum rolled products:
Economic Growth. We believe that economic growth is a significant driver of aluminum rolled products demand. In mature markets, growth in demand has typically correlated closely with industrial production growth. In many emerging markets, growth in demand typically exceeds industrial production growth largely because of expanding infrastructures, capital investments and rising incomes that often accompany economic growth in these markets.
Substitution Trends. Manufacturers’ willingness to substitute other materials for aluminum in their products and competition from substitution materials suppliers also affect demand. There has been a strong substitution trend toward aluminum in the use of vehicles as automobile manufacturers look for ways to meet fuel efficiency regulations, improve performance and reduce carbon emissions in a cost-efficient manner. As a result of aluminum’s durability, strength and light weight, automobile manufacturers are substituting heavier alternatives such as steel and iron with aluminum. Carbon fiber and plastics are other lightweight material options, but their relatively high cost and limited end-of-life recyclability reduce their competitiveness as widespread material substitutes today. Consequently, demand for flat rolled aluminum products has increased. We also see strong substitution trends toward aluminum and away from steel in the beverage can market in certain regions. 
Seasonality. During our third fiscal quarter, we typically experience seasonal slowdowns resulting in lower shipment volumes, although this has been less significant as our product portfolio shifts and diversifies. This is a result of declines in overall production output due primarily to holidays and cooler weather in North America and Europe, our two largest operating regions.  We also experience downtime at our mills and customers’ mills due to scheduled plant maintenance and are impacted to a lesser extent by the seasonal downturn in construction activity.
Sustainability. Growing awareness of environmentalism and demand for recyclable products has increased the demand for aluminum rolled products. Unlike other commonly recycled materials such as paper or PET plastic, aluminum can be infinitely recycled without affecting the quality of the product. Additionally, the recycling process uses approximately 95% less energy than is required to produce primary aluminum from mining and smelting, with an equivalent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
Our Business Strategy
Our objective as the world’s largest aluminum rolling and recycling company is to lead the aluminum industry as the partner of choice for innovative solutions. We will maximize shareholder value through free cash flow generation and increasing return on capital employed. To achieve these objectives, we will focus on the following areas:
Defend the Core
Novelis is the leading global flat rolled aluminum supplier in the beverage can and automotive markets. We intend to protect our leadership position by continuing to deliver best-in-class customer service with improved quality, service and innovative solutions that differentiate our products. We are committed to producing the best quality products and providing reliable on-time delivery in order to be a true partner in innovation and sustainable supply solutions. We are focused on building and maintaining strong, positive relationships with all of our customers. In fiscal year 2019, we announced plans to establish a global network of Customer Solution Centers to accelerate collaborative innovation between Novelis and automakers to determine how to maximize lightweight, high-strength aluminum for the next generation of vehicle design. The first center is scheduled to open in Novi, Michigan with centers in China and Europe to follow.

In addition, we will maintain a competitive cost structure by managing metal input costs and employing initiatives to improve operational efficiencies across our global network. This includes a commitment to employee safety, product quality and system reliability. As a manufacturing organization, our primary concern is the health and safety of our employees. We are committed to strengthening a culture of safety across all levels of the organization. We are focused on optimizing our manufacturing and recycling operations to increase asset utilization and productivity. We continue to pursue a standardization of our manufacturing processes where possible, while still allowing the flexibility to respond to local market demands. 
Utilizing recycled material allows us to diversify our metal supply, helps control metal costs and provides environmental benefits. We define recycled content as the total amount of scrap metal used in production less melt loss. The percentage of recycled content within our aluminum rolled product shipments increased from 33% to 61% from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2019. We work closely with our customers on innovation to drive more sustainable products for society. We are the only company of its size offering high-recycled content aluminum sheet for beverage and specialty product customers. We are also working closely with our automotive customers to redesign automotive alloys to be made with more recycled inputs, as well as purchasing the aluminum scrap resulting from our closed-loop recycling partnership with our automotive customers. 
Strengthen our Product Portfolio

We maintain a focus on capturing global growth in beverage can, automotive and specialty products markets. Our management approach helps us to systematically identify opportunities that improve the profitability of our operations through product portfolio analysis. This ensures that we grow in attractive market segments, while also taking actions to exit unattractive ones. We will continue to focus on these core product markets to drive enhanced profitability, but will also continue to broaden our customer base and explore new verticals and product markets that fit within our overall strategic vision, which is to lead the aluminum industry as the partner of choice for innovative solutions. 
Invest in Growth Opportunities

Over the past several years, we invested in world-class assets and technical capabilities to meet increasing global demand for aluminum within the automotive market due to our continued focus on maintaining a scalable business model and growing alongside our customers. We now have automotive finishing lines in North America, Europe, and Asia operating near full production levels. In fiscal 2018, we announced plans to build additional automotive finishing capacity in North America with a 200 kt greenfield expansion in Guthrie, Kentucky and a 100 kt brownfield expansion at our existing facility in Changzhou, China. Construction is underway at both locations. Guthrie is expected to begin commissioning towards the end of fiscal 2020, with Changzhou expected to begin commissioning in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2019, we also announced plans to expand aluminum rolling, casting and recycling capacity at our flagship South American facility in Pindamonhangba, Brazil (Pinda) by 100 kt and 60 kt, respectively. Construction began in fiscal 2019 and is expected to be commissioned in late fiscal 2021. 
In addition to these recently announced organic investments, in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Novelis signed a definitive agreement to acquire Aleris Corporation (Aleris), a global supplier of rolled aluminum products, for approximately $2.6 billion including the assumption of debt. For Novelis, Aleris, and their customers, the proposed acquisition will deliver a number of significant benefits by:

• | Establishing a more diverse product portfolio, including aerospace, beverage can, automotive, building and construction, commercial transportation and specialty products.


• | Integrating complementary assets in Asia to include recycling, casting, rolling and finishing capabilities and allowing Novelis to more efficiently serve the growing Asia market.


• | Broadening Novelis' automotive business to meet growing demand and diversifying its global footprint and customer base.


• | Strengthening our ability to compete against steel by gaining a greater platform for production, innovation and service.


• | Executing a fully debt funded deal with leverage forecasted to peak below 4x at closing, and return to 3x in approximately two years after closing.

The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close in fiscal 2020 (third quarter of calendar year 2019). Until the closing, the companies will continue to operate as separate entities. Following close, the two companies will integrate Aleris into Novelis, which will remain headquartered in Atlanta.
We will continue to explore other potential opportunities that will drive profitable volume growth in the automotive and other core end markets, while maintaining a balanced and disciplined financial approach in our decision making process.

Raw Materials and Suppliers
The input materials we use in manufacturing include primary aluminum, recycled aluminum, sheet ingot, alloying elements and grain refiners. These raw materials are generally available from several sources and are not generally subject to supply constraints in normal market conditions. We also consume considerable amounts of energy in the operation of our facilities.
Aluminum
We obtain aluminum from a number of sources, including the following:
Primary Aluminum Sourcing. We purchased or tolled approximately 1,350 kt of primary aluminum in fiscal 2019 in the form of sheet ingot, standard ingot and molten metal.
Aluminum Products Recycling. We operate facilities in several plants to recycle post-consumer aluminum, such as UBCs collected through recycling programs. In addition, we have agreements with several of our large customers where we have a closed-looped system whereby we take production scrap material from their fabricating activity and re-melt, cast and roll it to re-supply these customers with aluminum sheet. Other sources of recycled material include lithographic plates, and products with longer lifespans, like vehicles and buildings, which are starting to become high volume sources of recycled material. We purchased or tolled approximately 1,987 kt of recycled material inputs (less melt loss) in fiscal 2019. 
The overall benefit we receive from utilizing recycled metal is influenced by: 1) the overall price levels of the LME and local market premiums, 2) the spread between the price for recycled aluminum and the LME primary aluminum price and 3) our consumption levels of the recycled material inputs. We have in the past and may continue to seek to stabilize our future exposure to metal prices through the use of derivative instruments.
Our recycled content performance and methodology are detailed in our annual sustainability report, which can be found at www.novelis.com/sustainability. Information in our sustainability report does not constitute part of this Form 10-K. 
Energy
We use several sources of energy in the manufacturing and delivery of our aluminum rolled products. In fiscal 2019, natural gas and electricity represented approximately 97% of our energy consumption by cost. We also use fuel oil and transport fuel. The majority of energy usage occurs at our casting centers and during the hot rolling process. Our cold rolling facilities require relatively less energy. We purchase our natural gas on the open market, which subjects us to market pricing fluctuations. We have in the past and may continue to seek to stabilize our future exposure to natural gas prices through the use of derivative instruments. A portion of our electricity requirements are purchased pursuant to long-term contracts in the local regions in which we operate. A number of our facilities are located in regions with regulated prices, which affords relatively stable costs. We have fixed pricing on some of our energy supply arrangements.

Additional information related to our top customers is contained in Note 21 — Segment, Geographical Area, Major Customer and Major Supplier Information to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Distribution and Backlog
We have two principal distribution channels for the end-use markets in which we operate: direct sales to our customers and sales to distributors.
 | Year Ended March 31,
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
Direct sales as a percentage of total “Net sales” | 97 | % | | 97 | % | 94 | %
Distributor sales as a percentage of total “Net sales” | 3 | % | | 3 | % | 6 | %

Direct Sales
We supply various end-use markets all over the world through a direct sales force operating from individual facilities or sales offices, as well as from regional sales offices. The direct sales channel typically serves very large, sophisticated fabricators and original equipment manufacturers. Longstanding relationships are maintained with leading companies in industries using aluminum rolled products. Supply contracts for large global customers generally range from one to five years in length and historically there has been a high degree of renewal business with these customers. Certain customers require suppliers to complete a lengthy and expensive qualification process. The ability to obtain and maintain these qualifications can represent a competitive advantage. Given the customized nature of products and in some cases, large order sizes, switching costs are significant, thus adding to the overall consistency of the customer base.
We also use third party agents or traders in some regions to complement our own sales force. These agents provide service to our customers in countries where we do not have local expertise.
12

Distributors
We also sell our products through third party aluminum distributors. Customers of distributors are widely dispersed, and sales through this channel are highly fragmented. Distributors sell mostly commodity or less specialized products into many end-use markets in small quantities, including the architectural and industrial markets. We collaborate with our distributors to develop new end-use products and improve the supply chain and order efficiencies.
Backlog
Order backlog is not a material aspect of our business.

Additional equipment or process changes at some of our facilities may be needed to meet future requirements. The cost of meeting these requirements may be significant. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, obligations to pay damages or other costs, and injunctions and other orders, including orders to cease operations.
We are involved in proceedings under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or Superfund, or analogous state provisions regarding our liability arising from the usage, storage, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes at a number of sites in the United States, as well as similar proceedings under the laws and regulations of the other jurisdictions in which we have operations, including Brazil, certain countries in the European Union, and Korea. Many of these jurisdictions have laws that impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, for the costs of environmental remediation, natural resource damages, third party claims, and other expenses. In addition, we are, from time to time, subject to environmental reviews and investigations by relevant governmental authorities.
We have established procedures for regularly evaluating environmental loss contingencies, including those arising from environmental reviews and investigations and any other environmental remediation or compliance matters. We believe we have a reasonable basis for evaluating these environmental loss contingencies, and we also believe we have made reasonable estimates for the costs that are reasonably possible for these environmental loss contingencies. Accordingly, we have established liabilities based on our estimates for the currently anticipated costs that are deemed probable associated with these environmental matters. Management has determined that the currently anticipated costs associated with these environmental matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair our operations or materially adversely affect our financial condition.
