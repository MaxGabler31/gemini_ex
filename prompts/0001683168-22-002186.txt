ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
We were incorporated in Colorado on December 2, 2020. We acquired all rights to the GSP system on March 9, 2021 from Fourth Wave Energy, Inc ("FWAV") in return for the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of our common stock to FWAV.
 
We also assumed all liabilities (approximately $380,000) associated with seven consulting agreements previously signed by FWAV. The agreements with the consultants generally provided that the consultants would advise FWAV in matters concerning the development of natural energy systems, referred to as the "GSP system", in newly built and existing residences as well as new apartments and commercial buildings. Although these consulting agreements have since expired, we still owe $380,000 to the former consultants.
 
We plan to install natural energy systems, referred to as the GeoSolar Plus System (the “GSP system”) in newly built and existing residences as well as green new apartments and commercial buildings. The GSP System is based on combining solar power, geothermal ground sourced energy and other clean energy technologies into one fully integrated system. Our GSP system is designed to significantly reduce energy consumption and associated carbon emissions and improve the atmospheric and indoor air quality in residences.

Our business strategy is to form strategic dealership/licensing agreements with local solar power and plumbing companies making them our installation partners for the sale and installation of the GSP system.
 
Through our strategic dealership/licensing agreements we plan to grant all homeowners that purchase a GSP system a 25-year warranty and 100% financing through our anticipated licensees, of which we currently do not have any and we cannot guarantee that we will find any licensees that will be adequate to our business plans.
 
The Company through research and testing has developed, successfully tested, and is preparing to launch its first commercial product, a patent pending new system called GeoSolar Plus for powering homes that creates all the energy a homeowner uses with no carbon emissions or utility bills.
 
Solar Energy Overview
 
Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy. Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available. Solar technologies can harness this energy for a variety of uses, including generating electricity, providing light or a comfortable interior environment, and heating water for domestic, commercial, or industrial use.
 
There are three main ways to harness solar energy: photovoltaic, solar heating and cooling, and concentrating solar power. Photovoltaics generate electricity directly from sunlight via an electronic process and can be used to power anything from small electronics such as calculators and road signs up to homes and large commercial businesses. Solar heating and cooling (SHC) and concentrating solar power (CSP) applications both use the heat generated by the sun to provide space or water heating in the case of SHC systems, or to run traditional electricity-generating turbines in the case of CSP power plants.
 
Solar energy is a very flexible energy technology: it can be built as distributed generation (located at or near the point of use) or as a central-station, utility-scale solar power plant (similar to traditional power plants). Both of these methods can also store the energy they produce for distribution after the sun sets, using new solar and storage technologies.
 
In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of 48%. Thanks to strong federal policies like the solar Investment Tax Credit, rapidly declining costs, and increasing demand across the private and public sector for clean electricity, there are now nearly 100 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity installed nationwide, enough to power 18.9 million homes.
 
The cost to install solar has dropped by more than 70% over the last decade, leading the industry to expand into new markets and deploy thousands of systems nationwide. Prices as of Q4 2021 are at their lowest levels in history across all market segments. An average-sized residential system has dropped from a pre-incentive price of $40,000 in 2010 to roughly $20,000 for average 8 kilowatts (KW) system today.
 
Solar has ranked first or second in new electric capacity additions in each of the last years. In 2019, 40% of all new electric capacity added to the grid came from solar, the largest such share in history. Solar's increasing competitiveness against other technologies has allowed it to quickly increase its share of total U.S. electrical generation - from just 0.1% in 2010 to more than 3.0% today.
 
Homeowners and businesses are increasingly demanding solar systems that are paired with battery storage. While this pairing is still relatively new, the growth over the next five years is expected to be significant. By 2025, more than 25% of all behind-the-meter solar systems will be paired with storage, compared to under 5% in 2019.
 
The residential solar market experienced a record year in 2019 as costs continued to fall and solar expanded into more state markets. While California had its strongest year ever due to the emergence of solar storage as a remedy for disruptive power shutoffs, emerging markets also enjoyed strong growth. Future growth is expected across the country as prices continue to fall and combined solar + storage systems become increasingly viable.

It is believed the installation of the GSP system will result in a more valuable, cleaner and healthier home and is highly economic for the homeowner.
 
The GSP system will symbolize an important advancement in the way homes are cooled, heated and powered and that the market for the GSP system will be substantial.
 
A rendering of the GSP system follows:
 


Tiered Installation Levels
 
We plan to offer the GSP system installation packages in three tiers (Silver, Gold, and Platinum). This way we can tailor to the specific needs of each individual homeowner. The average new or existing home installation costs approximately $59,500 after 26% federal tax credits and potential state tax credits that could be available on a state by state basis.
 
The system can be 100% financed at low interest rates or added to a mortgage. We estimate that the payments will likely be less than the homeowner’s current utility bills.
 
As of the date of this Offering Circular the Company has installed one GSP system and had contracts, which will provide us with gross revenue of approximately $20,000, for the installation of other GSP systems. The one GSP system we installed was to test the system in a "live" environment and the amount we received for installing the system was credited to research and development expenses. There have been 29 GSP systems installed, 28 of the GSP systems were installed by the inventor of the GSP system that we acquired.

Geothermal Heat Pump Overview
 
Description
 
A geothermal heat pump system is an electrically powered heating and cooling system that transfers heat between your house and the earth using fluid circulated through long loops of underground pipes. In principle, a geothermal heat pump functions like a conventional heat pump, by using high-pressure refrigerant to capture and move heat between indoors and out. The difference is that conventional systems gather their heat—and get rid of it—through the outside air. Geothermal systems, in contrast, transfer heat through long loops of liquid-filled pipes buried in the ground.
 
As with ordinary heat pumps, the refrigerant in a geothermal heat pump runs in a loop through a compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and evaporator, collecting heat at one end and giving it up at the other. The direction of refrigerant flow, which is controlled by the reversing valve, determines whether heat is moving into the house in winter or being pulled out of it in summer. With the addition of a desuperheater, residual warmth from the system can also supplement a conventional water heater, further reducing energy bills.
 
We believe that the GSP system will be an integral part of making homes more efficient, as this will potentially cut home heating and cooling bills by an estimated 30 to 70 percent. Further benefits will include the elimination of noisy outdoor compressors and fans. Lastly, and for the benefit of the earth, the geothermal heating and cooling will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by greatly reducing the amount of gas and energy people use to heat and cool homes.
 

Installation
 
We will install an indoor heat pump which will use a basic refrigeration cycle—evaporation, compression, condensation, and expansion—to capture and disburse heat from and to the ground to warm the house in winter and cool it in summer. We estimate that it will cost around $15,000–$20,000 to install each system, including ground loops, heat pump, and controls.
 
A geothermal heating system is not difficult to retrofit with a standard heating ventilation and air conditioning system to a ground-source system, as long as burying the ground loop is feasible. A house will need air ducts to distribute cool air on hot days. Those same ducts can provide warm air in winter.
 
Some geothermal heat pumps can hook up to an existing air handler, other units come with their own integral air handler. Houses with hot-water heating can use geothermal systems, too, although additional radiators may be needed because these systems do not reach the higher temperatures of fuel-fired boilers.

Upon installation we will need to bury approximately 1,500 to 1,800 feet for a typical 2,000-square-foot home. This can be done generally in several ways. The first set up would be for a house on a large property where we could bury the pipes horizontally in approximately four-foot-deep trenches around the property, the second method would be used for houses on smaller properties or properties that are not good for trenching, in that instance we would need to drill several holes approximately three hundred feet straight down into the ground, and a third method would be available if there was an adequate sized body of water close to the home, in that situation we could run the pipes and coil them at the bottom of the pond. In the second method the drilling of the holes would add approximately 50% to the cost of installation.
 
Efficiency
 
We plan to use super-efficient geothermal heat pumps. These heat pumps will provide clean, quiet heating and cooling while potentially cutting utility bills by up to 70 percent.
 
It is estimated that it takes only one kilowatt-hour of electricity for a geothermal heat pump to produce nearly 12,000 Btu of cooling or heating. (To produce the same number of Btus, a standard heat pump on a 95-degree day consumes 2.2 kilowatt-hours.) Geothermal systems are twice as efficient as the top-rated air conditioners and almost 50 percent more efficient than the best gas furnaces, all year round.
 
Another advantage is that there is no need for a noisy outdoor fan to move air through the compressor coils. Geothermal units simply pump liquid, so they can be placed indoors, safe from the elements. Most geothermal units come with 10-year warranties, but they can last much longer.
 
Markets and Marketing
 
The renewable energy and efficiency market involves suppliers, distributors, manufacturers, and contractors; therefore, we plan to establish and maintain a loyal business relationships with all parties.
 
Technology for solar modules, battery storage, and energy efficiency products is constantly advancing, making it more affordable to create a more clean and sustainable energy. Renewable energy is one of the fastest growing industries worldwide. Showing continued growth from solar photovoltaic systems to electrification of vehicles. Due to the ever-changing climate, we will strive to stay relevant and adapt to ongoing environmental and regulatory changes and continuing to expand our business model to branch out with complimentary services.
 
Some new potential products, services and markets are as follows:
 

· | Bidirectional charge controllers using electric vehicles
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | Holistic approach to residential decarbonization through integration of envelope improvements, electrification and transitioning to heat pumps
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | JV with builders on development of electric zero carbon apartments
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Warehouse conversions to electric
--+----------------------------------


· | Neighborhood community green energy retrofits
--+----------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
 
Our business strategy is to form strategic dealership/licensing agreements with local solar power and plumbing companies making them our installation partners for the sale and installation of the GSP system.

Through our strategic dealership/licensing agreements we plan to grant all homeowners that purchase a GSP system a 25-year warranty and 100% financing through our partners. We are particularly excited about the Arizona and Colorado markets and plan to have a major presence in both states. Additionally, we plan to expand rapidly to Texas, California, New Mexico, Utah and Nevada, where solar power is currently most prevalent.
 
We will potentially seek mergers and/or acquisitions with solar installers, geothermal installers and potentially product manufacturers to integrate our technology and application with their services and product line. This way, we do not need to spend as many funds on customer acquisition to expand into new territories, as we can use existing local providers and their existing customer base, which should save time and money.
 
Renewable Energy 
 
Renewable energy is defined as energy supplies that derive from non-depleting sources such as solar, wind and certain types of biomass. Renewable energy reduces dependence on imported and increasingly expensive oil and natural gas. In addition, growing environmental pressures, increasing economic hurdles of large power generation facilities and U.S. National Security interests are favorable drivers for renewable energy. Renewable energy, including solar and wind power, is the fastest growing segment of the energy industry worldwide.
 
Solar power, subsequent to installation, is an environmentally benign, locally sourced renewable energy source that can play an immediate and significant role in assisting global economic development, forging sustainable global environmental and energy policies, and protecting national security interests.
 
Competition
 
The markets we plan to serve are highly fragmented with numerous small and regional participants and several large nationally based companies. Competition in the markets we plan to serve will be based on a number of considerations, including our ability to excel at timeliness of delivery, technology, applications experience, know-how, reputation, product warranties, service and price. Demand for our products can vary period over period depending on conditions in the markets we serve. We believe our future product quality reliability, and safety supported by advanced manufacturing and operational excellence will differentiate us from many of our competitors, including those competitors who often offer products at a lower price.
 
Overall, the competitive environment of the renewable energy industry is very tense despite its market size. The Company competes with other distributors, installers such as Vivint, Tesla, SunPower, Sunnova, and many companies that install geothermal pumps and piping such as WaterFurnace and Dandelion Energy, to name some of the other renewable energy companies that are currently in our industry. These competitors possess significantly greater financial and non-financial resources, manufacturing capacity, well established business models and distribution channels and branding.
 
Patents and Trademarks 
 
The trademarks currently owned by the Company, and for which it intends to seek federal transaction registration are the marks, GeoSolar Technologies, SmartGreen™ and Leading the Clean Electric Home Revolution™. The Company may federally register other trademarks in the future as the need arises. The Company on May 17, 2021, applied for a United States Patent on its System to Decarbonize, Ventilate and Electrify a Dwelling. This application is currently in provisional status and is application number 63/189,629.
Regulation
 
We face extensive government regulation both within and outside the U.S. relating to the development, installation, marketing, sale and distribution of our renewable energy products, software and services. The following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. For a description of risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to, please refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Businesses.”

We are not a “regulated utility” in the United States under applicable national, state or other local regulatory regimes where we conduct business.
 
To operate our systems we obtain interconnection agreements from the applicable local primary electricity utility. Depending on the size of the solar energy system and local law requirements, interconnection agreements are between the local utility and either us or our customer. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection agreements. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection agreements are signed. We maintain a utility administration function, with primary responsibility for engaging with utilities and ensuring our compliance with interconnection rules.
 
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
 
Federal and/or state prevailing wage requirements, which generally apply to any “public works” construction project that receives public funds, may apply to installations of our solar energy systems on government facilities. The prevailing wage is the basic hourly rate paid on public works projects to a majority of workers engaged in a particular craft, classification or type of work within a particular area. Prevailing wage requirements are established and enforced by regulatory agencies. Our Sole Officer and Director monitor and coordinate our continuing compliance with these regulations.
 
Seasonality
 
We do not expect any seasonality in our business.
 
Employees
 
We have one full-time employee, that being our sole officer. We anticipate adding additional employees in the next 12 months, as needed. We do not feel that we would have any unmanageable difficulty in locating needed staff in large part because of our Remote Work corporate structure that allows for location and time flexibility.
Intellectual Property
 
We may rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, databases, and our brand.
 
We plan to have a policy of requiring key employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. Our employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us. In addition, in the future we will have a policy requiring individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
We may from time to time be involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature we believe are normal and incidental to our business. These matters may include product liability, intellectual property, employment, personal injury caused by our employees, and other general claims. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
