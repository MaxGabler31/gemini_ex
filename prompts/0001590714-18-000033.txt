Business Overview
Platform, incorporated in Delaware in January 2014, is a global and diversified producer of high-technology specialty chemical products. Our business involves the blending of a number of key ingredients to produce proprietary formulations. Utilizing our strong industry insight, process know-how, and creative research and development, we partner with our customers to provide innovative and differentiated solutions that are integral to their finished products. We operate in a wide variety of attractive niche markets across multiple industries, including automotive, agricultural, animal health, electronics, graphics, and offshore oil and gas production and drilling. We believe the majority of our operations hold strong positions in the markets they serve. Our product innovations and product extensions are expected to continue to drive sales growth in both new and existing markets, while also expanding margins by continuing to offer high-customer-value propositions.
Platform has strong market positions in niche segments of high-growth markets. We continually seek opportunities to enhance our growth and strategic position through inorganic initiatives, focusing on specialty chemical businesses or assets within our existing or complementary end-markets, particularly those meeting our “Asset-Lite, High-Touch” philosophy, which involves the following core elements:
•prioritizing resources to research and development;
•offering highly technical sales and customer service; and
•managing conservatively our capital investments. 
We regularly review acquisition opportunities and may acquire businesses that meet our acquisition criteria when we deem it to be financially prudent. 
We manage our business in two segments: Performance Solutions and Agricultural Solutions, which are each described below under "Business Segments." Both segments share a common focus on attractive niche markets, which we believe will grow faster than the diverse end-markets each segment serves. In 2017, we achieved sales of $3.78 billion, to which our Performance and Agricultural Solutions segments each contributed approximately 50%.
For financial information about our operating segments and the geographic areas in which we do business, please see Note 23, Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2017 Annual Report.
Proposed Separation of Agricultural Solutions 
In August 2017, we announced our intention to separate our Agricultural Solutions and Performance Solutions businesses. We believe this Proposed Separation, which we expect to complete in 2018, should maximize long-term value for our stockholders by enabling investors to focus on our specific different and differentiated high-quality businesses that serve two distinct segments of the specialty chemicals industry. However, this Proposed Separation, and any related transactions that we may decide to pursue in anticipation of the Proposed Separation, remain subject to final approval by the Board, as well as a number of conditions and variables, including financial market conditions and volatility, legal, tax or regulatory requirements, the establishment of the necessary corporate infrastructure and processes, and/or the possibility of more attractive strategic options arising in the future.

Seasonality
The Performance Solutions segment is not subject to significant seasonality.
Agricultural Solutions
Overview
Our Agricultural Solutions segment, which employs approximately 3,300 people, consists of legacy Arysta which was combined with two additional Crop Protection chemical companies acquired in 2014, Agriphar and CAS. By combining these businesses, we were able to gain further access to the large agricultural markets globally, including the United States (through the CAS Acquisition) and Europe (through the Agriphar Acquisition). Additionally, we gained formulation expertise and wider product portfolio which allowed us to better serve our existing clients.
Agricultural Solutions specializes in the development, formulation, registration, marketing and distribution of differentiated Crop Protection solutions, including BioSolutions and Seed Treatments, for a variety of crops and applications. Our diverse Crop Protection chemicals control biotic stresses, such as diseases (fungicides), weeds (herbicides) and insects (insecticides). Our portfolio of proven BioSolutions is comprised of BioStimulants, which are derived from natural substances applied to plants, seeds or the soil in order to enhance yields and help crops withstand abiotic stress, such as drought or cold, and BioControl products, which perform the same task as conventional Crop Protection products with, in many cases, the added benefit of reduced chemical residues. Our solutions are offered in multiple forms, such as foliar applications (direct application to leaves), furrow treatment (treatment of soil trenches or grooves wherein seeds are sown) or Seed Treatment (seed coating prior to planting). Our products are utilized by farmers through the entire growing cycle: from burn-down through pre-emergence to pre-harvest. Our products allow us to partner with growers to address the ever-increasing need for higher crop yield and food quality. 
Our focus on specialty applications (formerly referred to as our H3 priority markets and differentiated local solutions) and local grower needs demands a high degree of technical expertise and customer proximity. Our teams of local agronomists work together with our local marketing and commercial teams to develop tailored local products primarily targeting these applications. These products and solutions consist of one or more formulated, ready to use mixtures of different active ingredients, or AIs, to solve the needs of growers in a particular crop and in a specific country. Our local teams, especially in niche markets, allow us to better understand specific market trends and farmer requirements, which enable us to better innovate and address local needs faster and more efficiently. Specialty applications include Crop Protection solutions for niche and specialty crops like fruits and vegetables, products for underserved or hard-to-control pests affecting commodity grain crops, alternative application methods like seed and soil applied technologies, and bio-based products that are used as alternatives or additions to conventional chemical applications. We believe that the markets for these specialty applications are growing faster than the rest of the Crop Protection market and offer better opportunities for attractive margins given the superior value provided to the grower. As part of our specialty application focus, we have developed a growing BioSolutions and Seed Treatment business, organically and through acquisitions. Our BioSolutions business is focused on BioStimulants, Innovative Nutrition products, and BioControl products. 
We remain focused on expanding our presence in worldwide targeted markets by developing or acquiring crop protection products and obtaining registrations for new products, new uses for existing products, and uses of existing products in new countries.  
Products
Our Agricultural Solutions segment offers a broad range of proven Crop Protection solutions to growers worldwide, across foliar, in-furrow and Seed Treatment applications. We categorize our products in three core portfolios: Crop Protection (fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides); BioSolutions; and Seed Treatment.
These portfolios are each described below:

Crop Protection | We are one of the largest Crop Protection chemical companies by revenue. Our diverse Crop Protection chemicals control biotic stresses, such as diseases (fungicides), weeds (herbicides) and insects (insecticides). 
Fungicides | Fungicides prevent the spread of fungal diseases in crops. Our fungicides products include Evito, Fortix, Kasumin and Proplant. 
Herbicides | Herbicides are used to control unwanted plants while leaving the targeted crops to grow unharmed. We offer total, non-selective and selective, herbicides with a variety of formulations for many temperate and tropical crops such as soybeans, corn, wheat, oil seed rape/canola, vegetables and sugar cane. Our main herbicide products are Dinamic, Everest, Pantera and Select.

5


Insecticides | Our insecticides, such as Cythrin Max, Orthene and Talisma, are products used against insect pests at different stages of the pest life cycle, from egg and larvae to nymph and adult. These products can have both crop and public health applications. Acaricides or miticides control a variety of mite pests on crops. These products are primarily targeted at tree fruit and nut, vine, ornamental and selected row crop applications for effective mite control programs. Our main miticide products, such as Acramite, Floramite and Omite, are sold globally.
BioSolutions | We believe we are have a strong position as innovator in BioSolutions and BioStimulants. These products are derived from natural sources that fall into several categories described below. This portfolio is highly differentiated through innovative technologies and mixtures and primarily protected by trade secrets. 
BioStimulants | Biostimulants (biological stimulants) enhance crop vigor, yield and/or quality through physiological stimuli. Our BioStimulant products include Biozyme, BM Start and Appetizer. 
Innovative Nutrition | Innovative nutrition products optimize the nutrition in plants by enhancing nutrient availability or use efficiency. Our Innovative Nutrition products include the Poliquel line. 
BioControl | BioControl (biological control) products operate as conventional Crop Protection products with, in many cases, reduced residues of a synthetic origin. Our BioControl products, mainly biofungicides and bioinsecticides, include Ph-D, Carpovirusine, Vacciplant, Noctovi and a wide line of natural enemies and beneficial insects for Integrated Pest Management solutions in Japan. 
Seed Treatment | Our diverse Seed Treatment portfolio encompasses products, such as Rancona and Vitavax. Our Seed Treatments are applied before planting by coating the seed in order to protect it during germination and the plant during its initial growth phases. We anticipate growth in Seed Treatments as a result of the increasing value of seeds and the use of higher-value GM seeds. 

We consider these portfolios to be key pillars for our sustainable growth. We sell our products in specific regions and niche crop markets directly to seed breeders, growers, government entities, co-operatives, branded retailers and leading national and regional distributors. Our products are sold individually or combined within our "ProNutiva" program which integrates BioSolutions with either Crop Protection or Seed Treatment products. By combining BioSolutions with conventional protection products, ProNutiva aims at addressing the full spectrum of protection, nutrition and yield enhancement needs of farmers, often with lower residue levels, addressing safety concerns of end-consumers and resulting in enhanced farm economics for growers.
Seasonality 
Our Agricultural Solutions segment is seasonal in nature and corresponds to agricultural cycles within each region in which we operate. The geographic spread of our products can result in significant variations in earnings and cash flow during such cycles.  Crop Protection and Seed Treatment chemicals and BioSolutions sales typically begin ahead of the growing season and peak in the middle of the season.  In the northern hemisphere, farmers purchase the majority of their Crop Protection chemical inputs during the first half of the calendar year from distributors which we start to supply during the fourth quarter of the previous year.  Growers in the southern hemisphere purchase the majority of their products in the second half of the year.  As a result, we have historically experienced fluctuations in quarterly sales. For example, due to the size of our market in Latin America, we typically generate greater net sales in the second half of the calendar year.
Weather conditions and natural disasters such as drought and floods in a particular region, storms, hurricanes, tsunamis, hail, tornadoes, freezing conditions or extreme heat in a particular region affect decisions by our customers and end-users about the types and amounts of products to purchase and the timing of use of such products.  The high degree of correlation between sales patterns and unpredictable weather conditions makes drawing conclusions from quarterly sales difficult.
Competitive Strengths of Platform
We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and contribute to the ongoing success of both of our segments:

• | “Asset-Lite, High-Touch” Business Model. Our businesses are evidenced by high margins and low capital expenditures which translates into high cash flow margins and returns on capital. Over 40% of our employees are in either technological innovation or sales and services areas; hence “high-touch.” Our commitment to technological innovation and our extensive intellectual property portfolio enables us to develop our cutting-edge products. In order to continue to provide innovative products and highly specialized technical service to our customers, we place a premium on maintaining an expert and qualified employee base. Our business involves the formulation of a broad range of specialty chemicals, created by blending raw materials or developing new uses for existing AIs. This model allows us to conservatively manage our investments in fixed assets to both maintain and grow our businesses. Our existing fixed asset base is modern and well-maintained and, accordingly, requires low capital expenditures for maintenance.

• | Industry Leading Positions. Our businesses strategically focus on acquiring and maintaining leading positions in niche sectors of high-growth markets by offering high value-added services to our customers. We believe our scale and global reach in product development, marketing, and formulation provides us with advantages over many of our competitors, allowing us to maintain strong market share positions and drive profitable growth. Our strong market positions contribute to our ability to attract new customers and successfully enter new end-markets. 


• | Customer Driven Innovation and Partnerships. We frequently work alongside our customers and other industry participants to develop new products and identify new market opportunities. We participate in a variety of dynamic end-markets where new unmet needs are always materializing. Our large sales and technical service teams provide continuous insights that help ensure our research and development efforts are appropriately focused. Customer requirements can lead to improved or uniquely tailored formulations of existing product offerings or to the development of completely new products to satisfy previously unmet needs. Tailoring products for specific OEMs or specific localized growing regions leads to sticky sales and significant customer switching costs. In our Agricultural Solutions business, we also frequently partner with molecule discovery focused companies to source new and complementary AIs for our portfolio. We believe these companies value our vast knowledge of local markets, regulations and distribution channels as they look to establish post-patent management strategies for their existing molecules. 


• | Strong Expertise in Registration and Distribution. Product registration is complex and crucial, particularly in the agrochemical space. Our Agricultural Solutions segment has a large team of specialists dedicated to the regulatory process across various jurisdictions, and we believe we are well-experienced in obtaining and defending the required registrations for our products in each country in which they are sold and for each crop on which they are applied. Once obtained, these registrations provide a right to use a product for a specified crop in that country or region for a number of years. In addition, our Agricultural Solutions segment has a strong network of distributors, which currently reaches over 100 countries and jurisdictions. Our large distribution network enables us to focus on profitable niche applications, which we believe are less sensitive to competitive pricing pressures. This distribution network, together with our geographical footprint, also allows us to attract licensing and resale opportunities from partner companies for new products, technologies, and applications. 


• | Comprehensive Product Offering. We provide our customers with a comprehensive offering of products that meet many of their specialty chemical needs. In many cases, we offer a full suite of products with complementary capabilities that provide a complete functional solution to the customer. We believe the ability to provide a “top-to-bottom” product offering is a significant competitive advantage over many of our smaller and regional competitors. We also believe that our existing product offerings offer many opportunities for growth in adjacent end-markets. 


• | Performance-Driven Culture and Board with Proven Track Record. We believe we have outstanding people who can deliver superior performance under the tutelage and oversight of proven and experienced leadership. Our culture is performance-focused and driven by empowering team members and then holding them accountable for their outcomes. We measure people on financial results, safety, customer satisfaction and commitments, legal compliance, and environmental stewardship. We measure our performance against benchmarks and drive operational excellence through continuous improvement. Our experienced management team is complemented by an experienced Board, which includes individuals with proven track records of successfully acquiring and managing businesses. Our business segments are also led by executives that have extensive experience in their respective fields. 

Business Strategies
We aim to build a best-in-class, global formulator, marketer, and distributor of specialty chemical products. Our primary measure of success is long-term intrinsic shareholder value creation, which we hope to achieve through profitable sales growth and continuous cost improvement. We seek to develop and engineer new products and processes, leverage our global scale to enter new markets and optimally manage our existing portfolio of specialty chemical businesses. Our efforts are directed by the following key business strategies:

• | Expand our Core Businesses. We believe that we can capitalize on our existing capabilities to further enhance our technical capabilities, sophisticated process know-how, solutions orientation, strong customer relationships and deep industry knowledge. The Acquisitions enhanced the growth of each of our segments by extending their respective products breadth and expanding their international reach. We intend to further extend many of our product offerings through the development of new applications for our existing products or through synergistic combinations, and to target geographies with attractive market fundamentals where our strengths in marketing, portfolio development, regulation and customer education can add value for our customers. 


• | Focused Investment in Product Innovation. We place a strong emphasis on innovation. New products are developed and created by drawing upon our significant intellectual property portfolio and technical expertise. Building on our core competencies in product innovation, applications development, and technical services, we intend to drive organic

growth by reaching new high-growth markets and expanding upon our existing technologies to develop new products for existing and adjacent markets.

• | Leverage Customer Relationships. We intend to continue to leverage our close customer relationships to execute our growth strategy by working directly with our customers to identify opportunities for new products. We also have strong collaborative relationships with OEMs who specify which specialty materials, chemistries, and technologies they need in their products. Working directly with our customers allows us to increase OEM qualification of our products and identify opportunities to grow with our customers. Such close customer relationships also provide a solid barrier to entry for competition. 


• | Pursue Strategic Inorganic Growth. Our founder, Martin E. Franklin and our Chief Executive Officer, Rakesh Sachdev have significant experience and expertise and have been highly successful in acquiring, integrating, and growing value-added businesses. We intend to pursue further inorganic initiatives as a way to enhance our growth and strategic position. We intend to focus primarily on businesses or assets within our existing end-markets that share our “Asset-Lite, High-Touch” philosophy, with product offerings that provide geographic or product complementarity. We expect to achieve commercial and distribution efficiencies by expanding into related categories that can be marketed through our existing distribution channels or provide us with new distribution channels for our existing products. We plan to only pursue opportunities that we believe meet our acquisition criteria and when we deem it to be financially prudent. 


• | Focus on Human Capital. The success of our business depends on our ability to continue to capitalize on our technical capabilities, unique process know-how, strong customer relationships, and industry knowledge. The technical expertise and history of innovation demonstrated by our employees reflect the specialized and highly skilled nature of our research and development personnel. As such, we intend to focus on attracting, retaining, and developing the best human capital across all levels of our organization, which is key to our ability to successfully operate and grow our business. 

Customers
We have a diverse customer base, as we sell our products either directly to end-user customers or through intermediaries, such as independent, third-party distributors, agricultural cooperatives, retailers, and government agencies.  We also have collaborative relationships with many OEMs and industry partners, who specify our chemistries and technologies for use in their products or grant us development rights of their intellectual property. A significant portion of our sales are through such intermediaries.
Within each segment, we rely on independent representatives and distributors to distribute our products and to assist us with the marketing and sale of certain of our products. We believe that we are able to attract new customers successfully through our international reach, coupled with our local knowledge and on-the-ground presence, which enables us to meet the needs of our customers. We have a global network of 54 manufacturing sites, 11 of which include research facilities, and 16 stand-alone research centers, all supported by a direct sales force in nearly 70 countries. Our flexible manufacturing base allows for "just in time" supply chain management. We operate a relatively large number of small and medium-sized facilities located close to our customers throughout the world's major economic regions. This close proximity to our global customers' local sites enables access to all key growth markets.
We believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer.  Although no customer or distributor constitutes 10% or more of our consolidated net sales, we do have some customers and distributors, the loss of which may impair our results of operations, for certain business lines, for the affected earnings periods.
Due to the relatively short cycle times in our business, our order backlog levels are minimal.
Selling & Marketing 
We employ a customer-centric sales and marketing force of professionals worldwide.  These professionals have strong technical expertise, local market knowledge and intimate customer relationships.  Our local sales and marketing teams closely monitor their market trends and maintain active dialogue with our customers to assess and understand their constantly evolving challenges.  We use this feedback from our local sales teams to anticipate future needs, respond rapidly to changing market conditions, and deliver customized, value-added solutions for our customers.  This feedback loop is an important source of new product ideas and helps guide our capital allocation decisions and research and development plans.  We leverage local market intelligence to develop new and innovative products that are then marketed by our local sales and marketing teams throughout the markets we serve.

Performance Solutions
In our Performance Solutions segment, methods for selling and marketing our proprietary products vary slightly by geographic region.  In total, we generate business through the efforts of regional sales, technical and service personnel, as well as distributors.  In addition to regional sales and service staff, we maintain a group of global personnel focused on coordinating sales projects and obtaining design specifications for complex projects involving multiple customers within the manufacturing supply chain.
Agricultural Solutions
In our Agricultural Solutions segment, our products are sold in over 100 countries globally and reach growers through a wide variety of market channels.  Our sales, marketing, and go-to-market strategies vary significantly by territory and depend to a large extent on the existing distribution infrastructure and market practices in each particular region.  We work with national and regional distributors, retailers, co-ops, government entities and directly with growers to promote and sell our solutions.  We have loyalty programs in place for distributors and engage in active grower education to promote our products and brands.  Our global presence and local capabilities make us a partner of choice for other Crop Protection chemical companies, who often enter into exclusive distribution or license agreements with us.  These agreements give us the exclusive right to distribute or formulate their products in, or with respect to, specified territories, crops, applications, channels and formulations.
Employees
In order to ensure that we are able to continue to provide innovative products and highly technical service to our customers, we place a premium on maintaining a highly specialized and qualified employee base.  At December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 7,850 full-time employees in approximately 70 countries, including approximately 3,400 research and development chemists, experienced technical service, and technical sales personnel. 
In addition, many of our full-time employees are employed outside the United States.  In certain countries where we operate, our employees are also members of unions or are represented by works councils as required by law.  We are required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these unions and/or works councils for any changes to our activities or employee benefits.
Our management believes that our relationships with our employees and collective bargaining unions are satisfactory.
Research and Development
Continued investment in research and development ensures that we remain ahead of emerging trends, delivering solutions to strengthen our strong market positions in terms of innovation and product development in our market niches. Our research and development activities are also focused on developing products, and improving formulations and processes that will drive growth or otherwise add value to our core business operations.  We accelerate market introductions and increase the impact of our product offerings through collaboration with partners in the commercial sector (customers and value-chain partners) and by working with distributors, OEMs, governments and local communities around the world. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts. 
Performance Solutions
With respect to our Performance Solutions segment, our commitment to technological innovation and our extensive intellectual property portfolio enables us to develop differentiated products at the forefront of the technology. Research resulting in new, proprietary formulations is performed principally in Germany, Great Britain, India, Japan, and the United States. During 2017, the segment's research and development expenses totaled $46.4 million, which represented 2.5% of Performance Solutions' total net sales. Substantially all research and development activity was performed internally. 
Agricultural Solutions
Within our Agricultural Solutions segment, our global and regional marketing teams conduct a rigorous process for identifying key AIs with proven technical efficacy, which can be brought to market through our formulation, marketing, and distribution capabilities, in order to address strategic gaps in our portfolio.  Our experienced regulatory team has a strong and successful track record of obtaining product registrations expeditiously to support this product strategy. During 2017, the segment invested $92.5 million in research and development, of which $40.5 million was capitalized and $52.0 million was expensed. In 2017, research and development investments represented approximately 5% of Agricultural Solutions' total net sales.

Competitive Environment
Our markets are consolidating, highly competitive, and subject to rapid changes in technology. Broadly speaking, we compete in the specialty chemicals market.  On a more narrow scale, we compete in markets for specialty chemicals for Crop Protection, BioSolutions and Seed Treatment chemicals, and electronic applications, general metal and plastic finishing, oil and gas exploration and production, and printing. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to promoting and selling certain products.
The competitive environment of each of our segments is described below:
Performance Solutions
Our Performance Solutions segment provides a broad line of proprietary chemical compounds and supporting services, and broadly competes within the specialty chemicals industry. Although competition varies by end-market and geography, our most significant competitors are Atotech Inc., and DowDupont Inc., across its industrial and electronics chemicals businesses, as well as Asahi, Senju, Tamura, and Flint Group. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, technology, performance, reliability, brand, reputation, range of products and services, and service and support. We maintain extensive support, technical and testing services for our customers, and are continuously developing new products. Further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment, such as the recent creation of DowDupont Inc., as a result of the merger of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and The Dow Chemical Company, could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels. We believe, however, that our combined abilities to manufacture, sell, service, and develop new products and applications, enable us to compete successfully both locally and internationally. Some large competitors operate globally, as we do, but most operate only locally or regionally. We also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete.
Agricultural Solutions
The Crop Protection and Seed Treatment chemical sector is a highly developed and competitive industry with a wide range of established competitors that offer a broad variety of competing products.  Our main competitors include multi-national participants in this market, such as Syngenta AG, now owned by ChemChina, Bayer AG, BASF SE, DowDuPont and FMC, as well as a number of Japanese participants.
The BioSolutions sector is a newer and less mature market than the Crop Protection market; however, we still face significant competition from various competitors seeking to offer competing products and solutions to our customers. As a result, the BioSolutions landscape is highly fragmented, with a large number of small participants who have developed a niche product offering as well as a range of biotech companies focusing on research addressing new or early-stage technologies. Customer education and corresponding demand creation is a critical element of competing within the BioSolutions sector, especially for BioStimulants and Innovative Nutrition. Customer acceptance and adoption levels may vary widely and, in some cases, can be minimal for new and emerging technologies. Our current competitors include Novozymes Biopharma A/S, Verdesian LifeSciences LLC, Bayer Crop Science Inc. (AgraQuest, Inc.), Valagro SpA, BASF SE (Becker Underwood Inc.), Koppert Biological Systems and various others. Potential new competitors include entry by existing Crop Protection companies as well as the formation of new BioSolutions companies.
Raw Materials and Sourcing of Products
In our Performance Solutions segment, our business involves the manufacture of a broad range of specialty chemicals, which we create by blending raw materials, and the incorporation of these chemicals into multi-step technological processes.  Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis.  We typically purchase our major raw materials on an as-needed basis from outside sources, and the raw materials that are of greatest importance to our global operations are, in most cases, obtainable from multiple sources worldwide.
In our Agricultural Solutions segment, we rely on contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain inputs or key components for our product formulations.  These inputs, which are generally a combination of technical grade AIs, semi-finished goods, inerts and packaging materials, are typically sourced close to where we ultimately formulate and sell our products.  We source almost all of our AIs from third-party manufacturers, which represent a relatively limited number of key suppliers.  We strive to maintain multiple high-quality supply sources for each AI; however, due to the proprietary nature of some of our products, finding alternative new sources can be challenging. Our goal is to maximize our sourcing of raw materials from quality suppliers in countries with generally low manufacturing costs, such as China, Eastern Europe, and India.
10

We formulate and package our products in-house or through tolling and other third-party manufacturing and formulation arrangements.  We balance our in-house formulation with third-party arrangements to limit our exposure to utilization drop-offs, facility closures, and certain manufacturing-related environmental risks which helps optimize our cost structure.
Within certain portions of our BioSolutions portfolio, we manage an end-to-end supply chain.  We purchase natural raw materials, such as plant extracts and seaweed, to extract AIs for our BioSolutions products.
Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Products
Our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are important to our business and are protected by a combination of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, data exclusivity, and other marketing exclusivity rights, exclusive or semi-exclusive manufacturing arrangements, and other non-patent strategies. We seek intellectual property and other proprietary rights in major markets and other commercially-relevant jurisdictions worldwide. We implement confidentiality procedures and contractual exclusivity and seek other rights necessary to protect our intellectual property, proprietary formulations, processes, and other product-related rights.  We rely on trade secrets and know-how confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, natural product composition/origin, and formulations. We also enter into invention or patent assignment agreements, when applicable, with our employees, consultants, contractors, and other third-parties who may be engaged in discovery or development of intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Finally, we seek to include provisions in our material transfer agreements, license and development agreements, and other agreements that provide for the transfer of intellectual property rights back to us to the greatest extent possible under the circumstances of any specific transaction and development project.
Performance Solutions
In our Performance Solutions segment, at December 31, 2017, we owned, had applications pending, or licensed the rights to approximately 2,000 domestic and foreign patents, which have remaining lives of varying duration.  Although certain of these patents are important to our business, we believe that our ability to provide technical and testing services to our customers and meet their rapid delivery requirements is equally, if not more, important to our business.  No specific group or groups of intellectual property rights are material to our business.  However, we have many proprietary products which are not covered by patents and which are responsible for a large component of our total sales.  Further, we hold a number of domestic and foreign trade names and trademark registrations and applications for registration, which we consider to be of value in identifying our products.  We do not hold nor have we granted any franchises.
Agricultural Solutions
In our Agricultural Solutions segment, at December 31, 2017, we owned, had applications pending, licensed or had freedom-to-operate rights under, approximately 800 domestic and foreign patents, and approximately 6,800 product registrations.  This number includes multiple patents and applications with similar claims, filed in various countries. Where our rights to patents or applications are licensed, those rights may be exclusive or non-exclusive depending on such factors as which other AIs the product is formulated with and the field of use in which the product is applied. As part of our intellectual property strategy, we in-license or acquire patents from other Crop Protection chemicals and BioSolutions companies and pursue other patents not related to composition of matter, such as use extensions, formulations, mixtures and manufacturing processes. Certain of our products have multiple patents associated with their AIs, composition of matter, combinations with other AIs, methods of use, delivery technology, and manufacturing and formulation processes. We also differentiate with value-added mixtures and novel formulations, with launches prior to the expiration of the AIs' patent protection, to secure market position. 
Government and Environmental Regulation
We develop, produce and market our chemical products in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to extensive federal, regional, national and local laws and regulations in each country in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the Company’s manufacture, use, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of chemicals and hazardous substances, which are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards. We are required to meet these strict standards which, in recent years, have become increasingly stringent. However, no portion of our business is subject to re-negotiation of profits or termination of material contracts or subcontracts at the election of the governments in the countries in which we operate.
We are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. persons, U.S. issuers and U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making direct or indirect improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an improper advantage.   We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the Bribery Act, which also prohibits commercial bribery, solicitation of bribery, and makes it a crime for certain commercial organizations to fail to prevent bribery.  These laws are complex and far-reaching in nature and, as a result, we may be required 
11

in the future to alter one or more of our policies or practices to be in compliance with these laws or any changes in these laws or the interpretation thereof.  As previously disclosed, in connection with the implementation of internal controls, policies and procedures at Arysta, following the acquisition of that business in 2015, we discovered that certain payments made to third-party agents in connection with Arysta’s government tender business in West Africa might have been illegal or otherwise inappropriate. We have conducted an investigation and voluntarily informed the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice of this matter. After reviewing the matter, the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice both advised that they had closed out the matter and declined to take any action.  We consider the matter closed.
We maintain a Business Conduct and Ethics Policy and a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act/Anti-Corruption Policy, applicable to all our directors, officers and employees. In addition, our CEO and CFO are bound by the provisions of a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers. The Business Conduct and Ethics Policy, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act/Anti-Corruption Policy and the Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers were both approved by our Board and cover compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws, as well as other legal areas applicable to our operations.
Our business and our customers also may be subject to significant requirements under the European Community Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council dated December 18, 2006 relating to the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals, effective June 1, 2007 (or REACH). REACH, adopted in December 2006, imposes obligations on E.U. manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the E.U. to compile and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. Active substances and co-formulants used in plant protection products (pesticides) are generally exempt from REACH as they are considered as already registered under the Plant Protection Products Directive 91/414/EEC.  However, certain exceptions may apply that would require the active substance or co-formulant to be registered, particularly if the substance has a non-plant protection use.  While we have registered and continue to register substances as required, the registration process is lengthy and registration of certain of our substances may not be immediately effective.  The cost estimates could vary based on the number of substances requiring registration, data availability and cost.  The implementation of the REACH registration process may affect our ability to manufacture and sell certain products in the future.
As a manufacturer and distributor of Crop Protection products and BioSolutions, we are subject to extensive U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated properties and occupational safety and health matters.  In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (or EPA) regulates our Agricultural Solutions products under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and related legislation such as the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, or FQPA. In addition to EPA approval, we are required to obtain regulatory approval from the appropriate state regulatory authority in individual states. Many BioSolutions products, especially those classified as fertilizers, are not regulated at the federal level, but only at the state level. The FQPA requires a review of residue tolerances, based on assessment of aggregate risk for a single Crop Protection product and cumulative risk for Crop Protection products with similar modes of toxic action.
Governments in all countries have established legislation and systems for the review and approval of Crop Protection products. These laws require the preparation of comprehensive registration dossiers that must be submitted to the relevant authority in each country before sales can proceed. Once a Crop Protection product is registered in a country, it may generally be sold in such country for use on the crops for which it has been approved, subject to any specific use conditions. The global registration landscape is varied. Many countries have highly sophisticated registration systems and take two to four years to review a Crop Protection product before approving it for sale; in some countries, such as Brazil and India, the registration process can take longer (five to seven years). Some developing countries and countries with economies in transition base their approval on those granted in the more developed countries.
This highly-regulated environment represents both a challenge (cost, time, risk of failure or non-compliance) and an opportunity (to be more efficient and effective than our competitors).  In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards, and the costs of compliance have risen significantly. We expect that the trend of increased regulation will continue in the future. In response to this increased government attention to environmental matters worldwide, we continue to develop proprietary products designed to reduce the discharge of pollutant materials into the environment and eliminate the use of certain targeted raw materials while enhancing the efficiency of customer chemical processes. In addition, while regulation substantially increases the time and cost associated with bringing our products to market, we believe that our management team’s significant experience in bringing our and other companies’ technologies through regional, national and local regulatory approval processes, our efficient development process, and our ability to leverage our strategic collaborations to assist with registrations, particularly in Europe and Latin America, will enable us to overcome these challenges. We have and may in the future incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines and sanctions and third-party claims for property or natural resource damage or personal injuries as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities under, 
12

such laws and regulations.  At December 31, 2017, we believe we had appropriate liabilities recorded for our various environmental matters.
