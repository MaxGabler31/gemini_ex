Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
Spire Inc. (“Spire” or the “Company”), formerly the Laclede Group, Inc. (formed in 2000), is the holding company for Spire Missouri Inc., Spire Alabama Inc., Spire EnergySouth Inc., and other utility and non-utility subsidiaries. Spire Missouri Inc. (“Spire Missouri” or the “Missouri Utilities”) was founded in 1857 as The Laclede Gas Light Company and was renamed Laclede Gas Company in 1950 and then Spire Missouri Inc. in 2017. Effective August 31, 2014, the Company purchased Alabama Gas Corporation, which was formed by the merger of two gas companies in 1948 and renamed Spire Alabama Inc. (“Spire Alabama”) in 2017. On September 12, 2016, the Company purchased EnergySouth, Inc., along with its wholly owned subsidiaries, Mobile Gas Service Corporation and Willmut Gas & Oil Company, and in 2017, those companies were renamed Spire EnergySouth Inc. (“Spire EnergySouth”), Spire Gulf Inc. (“Spire Gulf”), and Spire Mississippi Inc. (“Spire Mississippi”), respectively.
Spire is committed to transforming its business and pursuing growth through 1) growing organically, 2) investing in infrastructure, 3) acquiring and integrating, and 4) innovation and technology.
The Company has two key business segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. 
The Gas Utility segment includes the regulated operations of Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi (collectively, the “Utilities”). The business of the Utilities is subject to seasonal fluctuations with the peak period occurring in the winter heating season, typically November through April of each fiscal year. Spire Missouri is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas, with primary offices located in St. Louis, Missouri. Spire Missouri is the largest natural gas distribution utility system in Missouri, serving more than 1.1 million residential, commercial and industrial customers. For utility regulatory purposes Spire Missouri has two regions, one serving St. Louis and eastern Missouri (“Spire Missouri East”) and the other serving Kansas City and western Missouri (“Spire Missouri West”). Spire Alabama is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas principally in central and northern Alabama, serving more than 0.4 million residential, commercial and industrial customers with primary offices located in Birmingham, Alabama. Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi are utilities engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas to 0.1 million customers in southern Alabama and south-central Mississippi.
The Gas Marketing segment includes Spire Marketing Inc. (“Spire Marketing”), a wholly owned subsidiary engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related activities on a non-regulated basis.
As of September 30, 2018, Spire had 3,366 employees, including 2,321 for Spire Missouri and 861 for Spire Alabama.
Spire’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and trades under the ticker symbol “SR.” The following table reflects Spire shares issued during the two most recent fiscal years:

 | 2018 | 2017
Common Stock Issuance | 2,300,000 | | 2,504,684
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (“DRIP”) | 23,023 | | 23,731 
Equity Incentive Plan | 85,637 | | 84,186 
Total Shares Issued | 2,408,660 | | 2,612,601

GAS UTILITY
Natural Gas Supply
The Utilities’ fundamental gas supply strategy is to meet the two-fold objective of 1) ensuring a dependable gas supply is available for delivery when needed and 2) insofar as is compatible with that dependability, purchasing gas that is economically priced. In structuring their natural gas supply portfolio, the Utilities focus on natural gas assets that are strategically positioned to meet the Utilities’ primary objectives.
Spire Missouri focuses its gas supply portfolio around a number of large natural gas suppliers with equity ownership or control of assets strategically situated to complement its regionally diverse firm transportation arrangements. Spire Missouri East utilizes both Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast gas sources to provide a level of supply diversity that facilitates the optimization of pricing differentials as well as protecting against the potential of regional supply disruptions. Spire Missouri West utilizes both Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain gas sources to provide a level of supply diversity that accesses low cost supplies.
In fiscal year 2018, Spire Missouri purchased natural gas from 34 different suppliers to meet its total service area current gas sales and storage injection requirements. Spire Missouri entered into firm agreements with suppliers including major producers and marketers providing flexibility to meet the temperature sensitive needs of its customers. Natural gas purchased by Spire Missouri for delivery to its service area through the Enable Mississippi River Transmission LLC (“MRT”) system totaled 57.1 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”). Spire Missouri also holds firm transportation arrangements on several other interstate pipeline systems that provide access to gas supplies upstream of MRT. In addition to natural gas deliveries from MRT, 58.2 Bcf was purchased on the Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc. (“Southern Star”), 4.4 Bcf was purchased on the Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission, LLC (“TGIT”) system, 11.1 Bcf was purchased on the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, LP (“PEPL”) system, and 0.7 Bcf was purchased on the Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC (“REX”) system. Some of Spire Missouri’s commercial and industrial customers purchased their own gas with Spire Missouri transporting 41.5 Bcf to them through its distribution system.
The fiscal year 2018 peak day send out of natural gas to Spire Missouri customers, including transportation customers, occurred on January 16, 2018. The average temperature was 7 degrees Fahrenheit in St. Louis and 2 degrees Fahrenheit in Kansas City. On that day, the Missouri Utilities’ customers consumed 1.80 Bcf of natural gas. For eastern Missouri, this peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to St. Louis through the MRT, MoGas Pipeline LLC, and Southern Star transportation systems, and from Spire Missouri’s on-system storage and peak shaving resources. For western Missouri, this peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to Kansas City through the Southern Star, PEPL, TGIT, and REX transportation systems.
Spire Alabama’s distribution system is connected to two major interstate natural gas pipeline systems, Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (“Southern Natural Gas”) and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (“Transco”). It is also connected to two intrastate natural gas pipeline systems.
Spire Alabama purchases natural gas from various natural gas producers and marketers. Certain volumes are purchased under firm contractual commitments with other volumes purchased on a spot market basis. The purchased volumes are delivered to Spire Alabama’s system using a variety of firm transportation, interruptible transportation and storage capacity arrangements designed to meet the system’s varying levels of demand. 
In fiscal 2018, Spire Alabama purchased natural gas from 15 different suppliers to meet current gas sales, storage injection, and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) liquefaction requirements, of which six are under long-term supply agreements. Approximately 67.0 Bcf was transported by Southern Natural Gas, 6.0 Bcf by Transco, and 6.0 Bcf through intrastate pipelines to the Spire Alabama delivery points for its residential, commercial, and industrial customers.
The fiscal 2018 peak day send out for Spire Alabama was 0.7 Bcf on January 17, 2018, when the average temperature was 21 degrees Fahrenheit in Birmingham, of which 100% was met with supplies transported through Southern Natural Gas, Transco, intrastate facilities, and one of the four LNG peak shaving facilities.
Spire Gulf’s distribution system is directly connected to interstate pipelines, natural gas processing plants and gas storage facilities. Spire Gulf buys from a variety of producers and marketers, with BP Energy Company being the primary supplier.

Natural Gas Storage
Spire Missouri believes that it has ample storage capacity to meet the demands of its distribution system, particularly to augment its supply during peak demand periods. Spire Missouri has a contractual right to store 21.6 Bcf of gas in MRT’s storage facility located in Unionville, Louisiana, 16.3 Bcf of gas storage in Southern Star’s system storage facilities located in Kansas and Oklahoma, and 1.4 Bcf of firm storage on PEPL’s system storage. MRT’s tariffs allow injections into storage from May 16 through November 15 and require the withdrawal from storage of all but 2.1 Bcf from November 16 through May 15. Southern Star tariffs allow both injections and withdrawals into storage year round with ratchets that restrict the associated flows dependent upon the underlying inventory level per the contracts.
In addition, Spire Missouri East supplements pipeline gas with natural gas withdrawn from its own underground storage field located in St. Louis and St. Charles Counties in Missouri. The field is designed to provide approximately 0.3 Bcf of natural gas withdrawals on a peak day and maximum annual net withdrawals of approximately 4.0 Bcf of natural gas based on the inventory level that Spire Missouri plans to maintain.
Spire Alabama has a contractual right to store 12.5 Bcf of gas with Southern Natural Gas, 0.2 Bcf of gas with Transco and 0.2 Bcf of gas with Tennessee Gas Pipeline. In addition, Spire Alabama has 1.8 Bcf of LNG storage that can provide the system with up to an additional 0.2 Bcf of natural gas daily to meet peak day demand.
Spire Gulf obtains adequate storage capacity through Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP, and Sempra’s Bay Gas Storage.
Regulatory Matters
For details on regulatory matters, see Note 14, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.
Other Pertinent Matters
Spire Missouri is the only distributor of natural gas within its franchised service areas, while Spire Alabama is the main distributor of natural gas in its service areas. The principal competition for the Utilities comes from the local electric companies. Other competitors in the service areas include suppliers of fuel oil, coal, and propane, as well as natural gas pipelines that can directly connect to large volume customers. For the Missouri Utilities, competition also comes from district steam systems in the downtown areas of both St. Louis and Kansas City, and for Spire Alabama, from municipally or publicly owned gas distributors located adjacent to its service territory. Coal is price competitive as a fuel source for very large boiler plant loads, but environmental requirements for coal have shifted the economic advantage to natural gas. Oil and propane can be used to fuel boiler loads and certain direct-fired process applications, but these fuels require on-site storage, thus limiting their competitiveness. In certain cases, district steam has been competitive with gas for downtown St. Louis and Kansas City area heating users. 
Residential, commercial, and industrial markets represented approximately 93% and 84% of fiscal 2018 operating revenues for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. Given the current level of natural gas supply and market conditions, the Utilities believe that the relative comparison of natural gas equipment and operating costs with those of competitive fuels will not change significantly in the foreseeable future, and that these markets will continue to be supplied by natural gas. In new multi-family and commercial rental markets, the Utilities’ competitive exposures are presently limited to space and water heating applications.
Spire Missouri offers gas transportation service to its large-user industrial and commercial customers. The tariff approved for that type of service produces a margin similar to that which the Missouri Utilities would have received under their regular sales rates. Spire Alabama’s transportation tariff allows it to transport gas for large commercial and industrial customers rather than buying and reselling it to them and is based on Spire Alabama’s sales profit margin so that operating margins are unaffected. During fiscal 2018, substantially all of Spire Alabama’s large commercial and industrial customer deliveries involved the transportation of customer-owned gas.
The Utilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that, to date, have not materially affected the Utilities’ or the Company’s financial position and results of operations. For a detailed discussion of environmental matters, see Note 15, Commitment and Contingencies, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.

All of the franchises are free from unduly burdensome restrictions and are adequate for the conduct of Spire Missouri’s current public utility businesses in the state of Missouri. In recent years, although certain franchise agreements have expired, Spire Missouri has continued to provide service in those communities without formal franchises. 
Spire Alabama has franchises in nearly all the communities where it provides service with terms varying from five years to an indefinite duration. Generally, a franchise is essentially a municipal permit to install pipes and construct other facilities in the community. All of the franchises are free from unduly burdensome restrictions and are adequate for the conduct of Spire Alabama’s public utility business in the state of Alabama.

GAS MARKETING
Spire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and providing energy services to both on-system utility transportation customers and customers outside of the Utilities’ traditional service areas. The majority of Spire Marketing’s business is derived from the procurement and physical delivery of natural gas to a diverse customer base. During fiscal 2018, Spire Marketing utilized over 43 interstate and intrastate pipelines and over 125 suppliers to market natural gas to more than 250 retail customers and 120 wholesale customers, primarily in the central United States (“U.S.”). Through its retail operations, Spire Marketing offers natural gas marketing services to large commercial and industrial customers, while its wholesale business consists of producers, pipelines, power generators, municipalities, storage operators, and utility companies. Wholesale activities currently represent a majority of the total Gas Marketing business.
In the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into agreements to purchase natural gas at a future date in order to lock up supply to cover future sales commitments to its customers. To secure access to the markets it serves, Spire Marketing contracts for transportation capacity on various pipelines from both pipeline companies and through the secondary capacity market from third parties. Throughout fiscal 2018, Spire Marketing held approximately 0.50 Bcf per day of firm transportation capacity. In addition, to ensure reliability of service and to provide operational flexibility, Spire Marketing enters into firm storage contracts and interruptible park and loan transactions with various companies, where it is able to buy and retain gas to be delivered at a future date, at which time it sells the natural gas to third parties. As of September 30, 2018, Spire Marketing has contracted for approximately 7.3 Bcf of such storage and park and loan capacity for the 2018-2019 winter season.
The Gas Marketing strategy is to leverage its market expertise and risk management skills to manage and optimize the value of its portfolio of commodity, transportation, park and loan, and storage contracts while controlling costs and acting on new marketplace opportunities. Overall, Gas Marketing saw significant growth in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of increased business with producers and integrated utilities, retail and wholesale customer growth, increased optimization opportunities resulting from its overall portfolio of assets, and more favorable market conditions.
