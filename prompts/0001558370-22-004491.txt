ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
​
Evolv Technologies Holdings, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Evolv”) is a global leader in Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) -based weapons detection for security screening. Our mission is to make the world a safer and more enjoyable place to work, learn, and play. We are democratizing security by making it seamless for facility operators to address the chronic epidemic of escalating gun violence, mass shootings and terrorist attacks in a cost-effective manner while improving the visitor experience.
​
Unlike traditional walk-through metal detectors, our touchless security screening solutions use AI software, software as a service (“SaaS”) cloud services and advanced sensors to reliably detect dangerous weapons while significantly reducing nuisance alarms from harmless personal items. This means that visitors can walk through our solution without stopping, without removing items from their pockets or bags, and without having to form a single file line. Our products significantly reduce the number of false positive alarms, allowing security staff to focus their attention on high probability threats.
​
Our innovative technology not only enhances security but makes screening up to ten times faster at up to a 70% lower total cost than traditional alternatives. Our products also deliver a largely touchless screening experience — a capability that has become an increasingly important consumer demand through the COVID-19 pandemic. Our products also provide unique analytic insights about security screening performance and visitor flows. Our products, which are offered to our customers primarily under a multi-year subscription pricing model, deliver both excellent value to our customers and predictable revenue streams for us.
​
We are focused on delivering value in the spaces in and around the physical threshold of venues and facilities. We believe that digitally transforming the visitor experience at the entry point to venues and facilities will be a critically important innovation in physical security. We believe that our solutions will not only make venues and facilities safer and more enjoyable, but also more efficient, more informed about their visitors’ needs, and ultimately more profitable.
​
Our touchless security screening systems have screened over 200 million visitors worldwide. We believe that we have screened more visitors through advanced AI-based detection systems in the United States than any organization, other than the United States Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”). Our customers include many iconic venues across a wide variety of industries, including major sports stadiums, notable performing arts and entertainment venues, major tourist destinations and cultural attractions, large industrial workplaces, federal and commercial office buildings, school districts, healthcare facilities, and houses of worship.
​
Touchless security screening represents a paradigm shift for the security screening market which, according to our estimates, is currently a $20 billion market opportunity on an annual basis. If a venue operator in the industries listed above has already adopted any type of security screening device to date, it is most likely a legacy metal detector that relies on inventions that are almost 100 years old.
​
This outmoded legacy approach presents numerous operational problems and hidden costs, including frequent nuisance alarms caused by the inability to distinguish between dangerous weapons and harmless items. These persistent false alarms often require visitors to undergo a cumbersome resolution process, including emptying of pockets, manual bag checks, and pat downs that are error-prone, labor cost-intensive, intrusive, and unpleasant. This also creates long wait times, requires visitors to advance in a single file line which results in dangerous crowding, and creates numerous opportunities for weapons to slip into venues undetected. The net result is less effective security, unhappy visitors, and acutely stressful working conditions for employees, many of whom are hire-for-the-day contractors.
​
We believe that security professionals should not be forced to choose between providing strong visitor security and delivering a positive visitor experience. We set out to free venues and facilities from these agonizing tradeoffs and we believe that we have achieved this objective with our current systems.

​
Our systems allow visitors to walk through the security entrances of our customers’ venues at a normal pace with their bags in hand and without emptying their pockets. This significantly accelerates the security screening process while reducing the number of nuisance alarms, allowing security guards to focus their attention on real threats. Our touchless security screening not only identifies real threats, but it locates those threats for security personnel in real time. We believe there is significant demand for touchless security screening in venues and facilities that currently use slower, more invasive old metal detector screening, as well as in those that have not previously adopted weapon screening technology because of old screening’s inherent limitations. Our technology allows these locations to create a more comprehensive security posture, maintain an enjoyable visitor experience, and gain analytic insights about visitor flows and security screening performance.
​
Our potential to further scale this significant opportunity is rooted in our combination of deep domain experience and commitment to research and development. Our engineering efforts are led by a team of seasoned experts in software development, physics and electronics. We have worked extensively with security experts, our customers, and national security agencies to refine the security screening system and process to enable an effective and efficient security posture with an enjoyable visitor experience. Since our founding in 2013, we have invested significant resources in developing an extensive portfolio of proprietary know-how and differentiated technologies, with a focus on making security screening more precise, much faster, and far less labor intensive. Our systems, which incorporate these technologies, offer several key advantages over old alternatives.
We have built our own direct sales organization and developed a global distribution channel of strategic partners and resellers to reach a broad global audience and to market, sell, and support our products. Our network of third-party value-added resellers covers more than 30 countries around the world and is composed of sales and distribution professionals with years of experience in physical security solutions. This enables us to sell and service our systems at-scale in markets globally and is designed to produce substantial operational leverage as we execute our strategy.
We are led by visionary technologists and a team of proven leaders with experience bringing emerging technologies to market across the software, physical security, and cybersecurity sectors. We believe that our technologies have the potential to accelerate the digital transformation of facility operations in ways that increase security, create a frictionless visitor experience, provide actionable intelligence, and reduce operating costs. We believe that, taken together, these core competencies will help us fulfill our mission and deliver enduring value for our customers.
Our Industry
We believe that most people associate security screening with airports, courthouses, and prisons. These facilities represent a small fraction of the total number of gathering spaces where mass shootings, terrorist attacks, and other forms of armed violence might occur, but they have historically had a disproportionate impact on the design and implementation of security screening technology. These specialized facilities are typically required by law to meet specific screening regulations using products built to meet technical standards designed for these environments. Many of these standards and regulations were designed in the pre-digital era of the last century.
Regulated facilities like airports and prisons usually have a local monopoly on the services they provide and therefore have historically been incentivized to emphasize technical regulatory compliance at the expense of the visitor experience. Security technology providers have historically focused on serving this regulated market and developed technology that meets the regulatory requirements, but without regard to the visitor experience. This limited functionality has unfortunately led many unregulated facilities to avoid security screening altogether rather than run the risk of creating a prison-like environment for their valued customers and employees. We believe that forcing venues to choose between better security and an enjoyable visitor experience is unacceptable. We believe the solution is to deliver technology that provides both.
Security screening at most venues and facilities has historically been designed around metal detectors that require visitors to enter in single-file lines after submitting their bags and pocket contents to manual inspection. This process is usually supported by multiple security guards who perform manual bag inspections, hand wand scans, and hands-on body ‘pat downs’ to resolve the large numbers of alarms, frequently false positives, generated by the metal detectors. 

2



This complex process has numerous shortcomings such as nuisance alarm fatigue, ambiguous alarms, frequent human error, frustrating delays, invasive contact, high labor costs, transient security staff, and lack of data insights.
The historical emphasis on technical detection performance using outdated standards tested in isolation has drawn attention away from performance of the screening process as a whole system. Legacy screening technologies effectively detect metal, but they also generate numerous false alarms for harmless items. To bring down the false alarm rate, security teams proactively divert metal items away from the metal detectors into manual bag check processes that are vulnerable to human frailty and relatively easy for a determined attacker to defeat. The result is a slow, frustrating process that fails to deliver the security it promises. The root causes are outdated technical standards, old analog technology, and the inability of humans to fully compensate for these deficiencies.
Our touchless security screening technology overcomes the limitations of old security screening technology and processes. We define touchless security screening as a screening process that reliably detects weapons and other threats in a way that allows most people to enter venues and facilities while walking at a normal pace together with their party, without requiring manual bag or body inspections. Touchless security screening provides a range of benefits including reliable precision, automated and targeted, high throughput, non-invasive, reduced visitor anxiety, improved security staff experience, cost effective, reduced physical footprint, continuous improvement, and analytic insights.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe that the current macro trends in firearms ownership, mass shootings, and pandemic awareness suggest that the need for effective security screening processes has never been greater and will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.
In the United States, there are as many as 444 million privately-owned guns in circulation. According to the Gun Violence Archive, in 2021 there were 693 mass shootings in the United States an all-time record in a year when most people were not free to gather. 
Based on our experience with customers throughout the pandemic, bolstered by original consumer research we have sponsored, we believe that consumers are and will remain uncomfortable with traditional high-touch security screening processes. We believe that visitors and security staff alike will continue to prefer a fully touchless security screening process in the future.
We believe that many venues and facilities have reluctantly chosen to operate without security screening because of the inherent shortcomings of old screening technology. Due to these macro trends, we believe that venues and facilities that already conduct security screening will feel increasingly compelled to consider alternatives. Further, we believe that venues and facilities that have previously chosen not to implement security screening due to concerns about cost, effectiveness, or visitor experience impact will feel increasingly compelled to introduce security screening for the first time.
We believe our market opportunity has both a security screening opportunity as well as an adjacent market expansion opportunity as follows:
Security Screening Opportunity
We estimate that our current primary market opportunity is for weapon screening at venues and facilities in the following segments:


• | Professional Sports Venues
--+---------------------------


• | Industrial Warehouses
--+----------------------


• | Distribution Facilities
--+------------------------


• | Large Workplaces
--+-----------------


• | Arts & Entertainment Venues
--+----------------------------

3




• | Government Offices
--+-------------------


• | Hospitality Facilities
--+-----------------------


• | Hospitals & Health Care Facilities
--+-----------------------------------


• | Houses of Worship
--+------------------


• | Educational Institutions
--+-------------------------

Using a variety of published industry reports and government data, we estimate that the above facilities together comprise nearly 400,000 sites and nearly a million individual thresholds where our security screening products could potentially be deployed. We estimate that this market represents over $20 billion in potential weapon screening system sales annually.
Most venues and facilities in our target segments do not fall under government regulations that mandate the adoption of security screening systems that conform to specific standards. We estimate that these unregulated facilities represent over 90% of the total worldwide market opportunity for security screening technology and represent the best opportunity for rapid adoption of our innovative weapon screening products.
We believe that our touchless security screening technology is poised to become the clear leader in this developing security screening market opportunity.
Adjacent Market Expansion Opportunities
We believe there are many additional opportunities for us to create new value-added applications that expand our market opportunity beyond security screening. Security screening and many other operational processes in venues and facilities are currently largely manual and analog. Our vision is to digitally transform many of these processes by adding new software applications and digital sensors to our platform. We believe our current products are establishing a foothold for our platform in the threshold area of venues and facilities. Potential future applications that could build on our presence in the threshold area include more advanced visitor and security screening analytics and credential verification for ticketed visitors or overall employee or visitor identification. We also see opportunities for new sensors and applications to help venues identify potential threats at the perimeter and guide visitors in the parking lots and other perimeter approach areas of facilities. As visitors pass the threshold to the interior of the facility, we anticipate opportunities to remove friction from the visitor, maximize retail revenue, and provide insights that may help reduce costs over time. We call this our Digital Threshold Vision. We estimate that the market for these incremental Digital Threshold Vision opportunities increases our total market opportunity to $100 billion annually by 2025.
Our Growth Strategy
The key elements of our growth strategy within our target market include the following:
•        Develop Initial Customer Successes in Specific Target Metropolitan Areas
Decision-makers at our prospective customers are often professionally connected to decision-makers at other prospective customers in different vertical industries within a specific target metropolitan area. We have established a successful pattern of targeting and winning lighthouse customers in specific vertical industries and then leveraging that success to solicit referrals at other venues and facilities across the metropolitan area in other vertical industries. We have developed a playbook for executing this pattern through orchestration of our direct sales resources and channel partners in a manner that we believe will continue to scale as we develop the available market.
•        Develop our Global Strategic OEM Partnership with Motorola Solutions
We have a global strategic OEM partnership with Motorola Solutions, a global leader in mission-critical communications and analytics technology. Motorola Solutions is also an investor in the Company. Motorola Solutions sells Motorola Solutions-branded premium products based on the Evolv Express platform, co-branded as Motorola Solutions Concealed Weapons Detection, through their worldwide 

4



network of over 2,000 resellers and integration partners. Additionally, we have created an integration between our platform and Motorola Solutions products. We plan to continue assisting Motorola Solutions in bringing these premium products to market through their channel partners and to assist them in delivering integrated solutions to their customers.
•        Expand and Activate Our Distribution Channels
We have a global distribution network consisting of over thirty value-added resellers covering more than thirty countries around the world. This includes global systems integrators such as Stanley Security and Johnson Controls and smaller regional resellers. Stanley Security is also an investor in the Company. We intend to continue to develop our distribution network by adding further geographic coverage and sales capacity based upon demand. We plan to continue to cultivate field level collaboration between our direct sales team and our resellers to develop the ability of the resellers to find, develop, close, and service customers independently.
•        Concentrate Marketing and Sales Effort in Specific Target Accounts in Specific Vertical Industries
Through our experience to date we have developed a proprietary list of target vertical industries, developed a list of target accounts within those industries, and identified target decision-makers in our target accounts. We believe that our target account list represents the best immediate growth opportunities for our business. Over time we plan to adjust our target account list to reflect current market conditions and the capabilities of our products. We plan to continue to execute advertising, content marketing, lead generation, and sales development activities to our target account list to create qualified sales opportunities.
•        Promote Awareness by Gathering and Leveraging Our Customer Community
Our business model presents significant opportunities to bring incremental value to existing customers over time. We intend to realize this value by seeking referrals from existing customers and partners to other prospective qualified customers, selling additional capacity to existing customers, and selling new add-on products and services to existing customers. We are continuing to develop and expand our customer success function within the global revenue organization to focus on helping customers successfully deploy our products and cultivate referrals, expansion, and upsell opportunities. We are also investing in programs to help our customers connect with each other to share best practices on a regional and vertical industry basis. Our buyers are naturally collaborative on security best practices due to their vested interest in collective deterrence and the likelihood that any security event will have a negative collective impact at the metropolitan, regional, or industry level.
•        Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships
We intend to selectively pursue acquisitions and/or equity investments in businesses that represent a strategic fit and are consistent with our overall growth strategy. Such partnerships would allow us to add incremental revenue and cash flows, accelerate market penetration of our products by enabling expansion of our product portfolio, access new markets, and provide a stronger value proposition for our customers while delivering increased customer lifetime value. We believe that because of our core focus on engineering and technology development as well as our expanding distribution network, we will be able to integrate and drive adoption of new technologies and capabilities acquired via strategic acquisitions.
Our Competitive Strengths
We are a disruptive innovator in the security screening industry with a mission to make the technology accessible to all venues and facilities that operate under a credible threat of armed violence. We believe our collective expertise coupled with the following competitive strengths, will allow us to maintain and extend a leadership position in next-generation security screening and expand our market opportunity:
•        Unmatched Detection Effectiveness Based on Artificial Intelligence Software
Based on feedback from our customers, we believe that real-world screening operations based on our products detect more actual weapon threats with fewer nuisance alarms than similar screening operations 

5



based on old walk-through metal detectors. Our solutions use digital processing and artificial intelligence to differentiate between real weapon threats and harmless items like phones and keys. The Evolv Cortex AI™ software platform provides the digital brain of our solutions. Unlike analog alternatives, our solutions classify threats based on classification models that improve over time as we process more real-world data. Evolv Cortex AI also makes it possible to integrate new kinds of sensors and data sources and integrate our solutions with other platforms and applications.
•        Large and Growing Data Set
The vast amounts of data collected by our products during each screening process constitute a large and diverse repository of digital machine learning training data for weapons and common non-threat items. This proprietary data set is essential in training our software to accurately classify a broad set of threats and non-threats under a wide variety of real-world conditions. We expect that this data set will continue to grow as our products are deployed in more venues and facilities. As the data set grows, we expect that our detection capabilities will continue to improve. In turn, we expect our customers to benefit from these improvements through regular software updates under our subscription business model. In a world where data is an increasingly decisive competitive advantage, we believe we are well positioned to deliver value to our customers in ways that competitors may be unable to match. 
•        Differentiated and Proprietary Technology Platform
We have invested significant resources in developing proprietary and patented technologies across artificial intelligence software, cloud services, and advanced sensors to accelerate the widespread adoption of touchless security screening. These technologies serve as the foundation of our products.
Our key innovations include:
•        Technology to process radio frequency (“RF”) electromagnetic data across multiple frequencies to detect size, composition, and shape of metal objects while in motion.
•        Technology to classify and differentiate the electromagnetic signature of weapons from harmless items such as smartphones and keys.
•        Technology to isolate relevant electromagnetic signals in the presence of external interference and noise generated by environmental factors such as structural metal, wind, and other factors.
•        Technology to process hundreds of thousands of sensor data points for each individual passing through security screening system while walking at a normal pace.
•        Technology to isolate a detected threat carried by an individual among an unstructured, overlapping flow of visitors walking through the system at a normal pace.
•        Technology to isolate the spatial location of detected threats and correlate this spatial data with digital imagery to provide a clear visual indicator to help security guards quickly and intuitively resolve any system alarms.
•        In addition to these core detection-related innovations, we have developed a purpose-built, proprietary housing for our advanced sensor arrays that features an attractive, welcoming, and customizable industrial design and supports a wide variety of indoor and outdoor configurations. We have also created cloud services to capture and present rich analytics and insights, support for remote system monitoring, remote system upgrades as new capabilities become available, and remote system diagnostics, and mobile application access. This technology platform is the basis of our future products and is critical to enhancing our existing offerings. Elements of these technologies and processes are protected by our know-how and by multiple patents or pending patent applications.
•        Extensible Product Platform
We have designed our platform so that it will be possible to add new types of sensors, new detection algorithms, and new cloud services and analytics to support new use cases, new applications, and new 

6



product offerings. For example, we were able to rapidly respond to customer requirements during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic by adding TempCheckTM application for elevated skin temperature alerts to our platform as part of the Thermal Imaging Package for Evolv Express.
We have also designed our platform with application programming interfaces (“APIs”) that allow integration and interoperability with complementary third-party security solutions such as biometric authentication, video management software, threat intelligence, messaging, and mass-notification systems. For example, we have used our APIs to integrate Evolv Express alerts to the Motorola Solutions Avigilon Control Center platform as well as to deployed venue access control systems. Other specific integrations to date include the Milestone Video Management System and Titan HST Mass Notification System.
•        High Screening Throughput
Our unique detection methodology results in fewer nuisance alarms and allows visitors to walk through in unstructured flows, without emptying their pockets and without surrendering their bags for manual inspection. The overall result is screening that is up to ten times faster than old screening processes. The result is a visitor experience that is more like walking through a shoplifting prevention system at a department store than an airport security checkpoint.
•        Significant Cost Savings
Because our technology generates so few nuisance alarms and scans visitors so quickly, far fewer security guards and equipment is required. The total cost per visitor scanned is up to 70% lower with our products, allowing venues to reduce overall operational costs and making security screening financially feasible at more venues and events.
•        Digital Access and Analytic Insights
Each of our products record over five hundred thousand points of anonymous digital data for each individual visitor. This flood of data allows us to generate analytics that appear in our Evolv Insights™ application. Evolv Insights™ provides self-serve access, insights regarding visitor flow and arrival curves, location specific performance, system detection performance and alarm statistics, and comparisons across multiple business dimensions. 
Using Evolv Insights, organizations use the powerful dashboards and metrics provided to inform their security decisions, operationalize the way their security and venue operations teams make staffing and traffic flow decisions to avoid overcrowding, rebalance security and operational resources, and improve the overall experience for their guests.
Smart venue security in the latest release of Evolv Insights includes: 
• On-demand: Mobile access to key metrics and remote scanner management help security and operations leaders make better, data-driven decisions about their security posture from any location, for more responsive venue management. 
• Data-driven: Analytics that allow for interrogation of threat types and alarm rates, informed decisions around sensitivity settings, and better understanding of event characteristics, improving security posture, staffing and training, and venue resource planning. 
• Connected: Remote management capabilities allow administrators to access Evolv Express systems for remote configuration and monitoring, including important notifications and system changes.
Evolv Insights™ Analytics Application
Our customers tell us that the analytics we provide are valuable because they have not previously been available at all or were too costly and time consuming to acquire through manual methods. As we add new kinds of sensors to our 

7



platform and integrate new external sensors and data sources with our data, we believe we will be able to deliver increasingly pivotal insights that will help make facilities even safer, more enjoyable for visitors, and more profitable for their owners and operators.
•        Key Strategic Global Partners
We have signed global strategic partnership agreements with Motorola Solutions, Stanley Security, and Johnson Controls. Each of these strategic partners has a globally recognized brand, a large global distribution network, global systems integration and support capabilities, and global customer networks full of potential prospects for our touchless security screening solutions. Both Motorola Solutions and Stanley Security are investors in the Company. We believe that these strategic partners will provide us with significant leverage and global reach that will allow us to rapidly scale our business and guide customers to success.
•        Global Distribution Capabilities
We have developed a global distribution network consisting of over thirty value-added resellers covering over thirty countries around the world. Our resellers, who have extensive experience in physical security technologies and processes, provide marketing, sales, systems integration, and local support services for customers across an array of vertical markets and regions. They also bring an existing base of customers into which we can drive awareness of and ultimately sell our touchless security screening products. Whenever possible we seek to form relationships with the leading resellers in each region in order to secure access to the most valuable existing customer relationships and the best talent pool available in each region.
•        Visionary and Experienced Management Team
Our management team and board of directors blend a range of skills and backgrounds from technology, cybersecurity, materials science, artificial intelligence, military, law enforcement and real estate. Our advisors are renowned industry leaders with experience at the United States Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), the U.S. military, the TSA, the United States Department of Homeland Security, the United States Intelligence Community and United States Congress. Our engineering team is led by accomplished and visionary technologists and scientists who have many years of experience in relevant fields. Our commercialization efforts are managed by individuals with prior successes in building and scaling both direct and indirect, channel-driven sales organizations.
•        Self-Reinforcing Adoption Cycle
We believe that as we acquire more customers and deploy more of our products, we gather more digital data that helps us improve the detection accuracy and performance of our systems and provide deeper analytic insights to our customers. As the accuracy and analytic insight of our systems increases, we believe more prospective customers will be attracted to our products and more engaged prospects will choose to purchase our products. We anticipate that this cycle will continue to operate in the future, creating ongoing competitive advantages for us and for our reseller partners.
Our Products
Since our founding in 2013, we have developed an extensive portfolio of proprietary technologies that form the foundation of our integrated security screening products, which are comprised of artificial intelligence software, cloud services, and advanced sensors.
Evolv Express
Our flagship product is Evolv Express, a touchless security screening system designed to quickly detect firearms, improvised explosive devices, and tactical knives in unstructured people flows. Evolv Express currently supports a maximum screening throughput of 3,600 people per hour. Evolv Express became commercially available in October 2019.

8



Evolv Edge
Evolv Edge is the legacy predecessor to our Evolv Express product. Evolv Edge supports structured, single-file people flows. It provides maximum screening throughput of approximately 800 people per hour. The primary distinguishing feature of Edge is that it is designed to detect non-metallic explosive devices in addition to complete improvised explosive devices, firearms, and tactical knives. Evolv Edge became commercially available in 2017. While Evolv Edge® is an important part of our legacy, we do not expect it to be a significant portion of our growth plan. As of December 31, 2021, we had write-offs of Evolv Edge® units and retired and removed units from service, and there will be no future sales of Evolv Edge® units. We are currently transitioning all domestic customers from Legacy Evolv Edge units to the most current Evolv Express units.
Licensing Model
We primarily sell our solutions under a subscription agreement that bundles our artificial intelligence software, cloud services, and advanced sensor equipment. We refer to this subscription as “security-as-a-service”, or “SaaS”. The security-as-a-service subscription agreement provides customers access to our solution for a defined time, usually with a multi-year term, annual pre-payment installments, and no right of cancellation. In some situations, we also sell our products under a purchase-subscription agreement by which the customer agrees to pay a one-time upfront fee for the equipment and a mandatory annual subscription fee for access to our software and cloud services. We also directly offer short term rental agreements for our solutions and allow certain reseller partners to offer rental terms to customers under certain conditions.
Our Customers
Our customers include many iconic venues across a wide variety of industries including major sports leagues, notable performing arts and entertainment venues, major tourist destinations and cultural attractions, large industrial workplaces, school districts, and houses of worship.
Our customer contracts typically range in size from $0.1 million and $0.5 million. The majority of our customer agreements include non-cancelable multi-year commitments as of December 31, 2021. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 and one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Research and Development
We believe that the touchless security screening market is poised for rapid technological advancements across software, cloud services, and sensors. We invest significant resources into ongoing research and development programs because we believe our ability to maintain and extend our market position depends, in part, on breakthrough technologies that offer a unique value proposition for our customers and differentiation versus our competitors. Our research and development team, which is responsible for both the development of new products and improvements to our existing product portfolio, consists of talented and dedicated engineers, technicians, scientists, and professionals with experience from a wide variety of the world’s leading physical security, cybersecurity, and software technology organizations. Our primary areas of focus in research and development include, but are not limited to:

Sales and Marketing
We sell our security screening products through both our own direct sales force and through a global distribution network consisting of over thirty resellers covering over thirty countries around the world. Our resellers sell our products to our customers, for whom they also perform installation, systems integration, and local support and maintenance services, with backup services provided by our internal support teams. Many resellers offer third-party physical security products including cameras, access control systems, and video monitoring systems in their respective territories and regions, which provides an opportunity to cross-sell our touchless security screening products to a broad, existing customer base that has purchased these other products. To augment the reach of our distribution network, we also intend to grow our direct sales efforts focused primarily on serving major accounts and expanding our footprint.
Our marketing strategies are focused on supporting sales growth by (1) driving awareness; (2) developing comprehensive sales and marketing content, tools, and campaigns for each stage of the sales process; and (3) scaling those campaigns via our global distribution network. We drive awareness for the Company, our security screening products, and our customers’ successes through public relations and communications efforts that span mainstream, business, social media and trade press across the security sector generally and in key verticals such as tourist sites, performing arts and entertainment, theme parks, industrial workplaces, municipal government, and professional sports. Our internal marketing team develops content in multiple formats and delivery methods to facilitate marketing campaigns and sales enablement.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
Our physical products are manufactured via a third-party contract manufacturer based in the United States with international quality certifications, such as ISO9001:2015. We design the products and processes and internally manufacture the initial engineering prototypes. Our internal manufacturing and supply chain teams work collaboratively with both our internal engineering department and our local third-party contract manufacturer to scale up the prototypes for commercialization through a phase gate product launch process. There have been significant efforts made in 2021 with our third-party contract manufacturer to scale up our production. Our third-party contract manufacturer also provides a variety of services including sourcing off-the-shelf components, manufacturing custom components/assemblies, final product assembly and integration, end of line testing and quality assurance per our specifications, material and finished goods inventory, and direct global shipping to our customers.
We initially manage the supply chain for key components and materials, and then, in some cases, set up supply agreements in conjunction with our contract manufacturer to enable stable supply and redundancy where applicable. Component purchasing is managed by our contract manufacturer’s sourcing team under a vendor list approved by us to leverage the buying power of their global scale. All of our products are built to our specification, work instructions and testing protocols. Inventory levels are managed with our manufacturing partners to ensure an adequate supply is on hand to meet business forecasts.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to drive innovation in the security screening market depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and abroad, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees and through non-disclosure agreements with our vendors and business partners. However, our contractual provisions may not always be effective at preventing unauthorized parties from obtaining our intellectual property and proprietary technology.
Unpatented research, development, know-how and engineering skills make an important contribution to our business, but we pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives and maintain our competitive position. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our intellectual property or that it will provide any competitive advantage. Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property or proprietary rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated. Further, the laws of certain countries may not protect intellectual property or proprietary rights to the 

10



same extent as the laws of the U.S., and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology.
As of December 31, 2021, we own or co-own six issued United States patents, eight issued foreign patents and have sixteen pending or allowed patent applications. In addition, we have two issued United States trademarks, four pending United States trademark applications, fourteen foreign trademarks and thirty-three pending foreign trademark application. Our patents and patent applications are directed to, among other things, security screening, threat detection and discrimination, imaging systems and related technologies. In addition to patents owned or co-owned by us, we have in-licensed ninety-five patents, including but not limited to metamaterials, RF imaging, compressive sensing, and signal processing, for security related applications.
While most of the intellectual property we use is developed and owned by us, we also use a combination of proprietary, open-source and third-party licensed software in connection with our services. Although we believe these licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business, these licenses typically limit our use of the third parties’ intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods.
From time to time, we have faced, and we expect to face in the future, allegations by third parties, including our competitors, that we have infringed their trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights or challenging the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property rights. We are not presently a party to any such legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Human Capital 
Our employees are critical to our success. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 173 people, of which 102 full-time employees are based in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area. We also engage numerous consultants and contractors to supplement our permanent workforce. A majority of our employees are engaged in research and development and go-to-market related functions. We consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.
Diversity and Inclusion. We value the diversity of our employees and are committed to providing an engaging and inclusive atmosphere for all employees that promotes productivity and encourages creativity and innovation. We strive to maintain a highly-skilled and diverse workforce where employees are hired, retained, compensated and promoted based on their performance and contribution to the Company.
Employee Development and Retention. The attraction, development and retention of our employees is a key focus for our Company. We offer training programs to enhance the knowledge, skills and advancement opportunities for our employees. We focus on maintaining a solid pipeline of talent throughout our organization and continually developing the capabilities and skills needed for the future of our business.
Work Environment. We believe that maintaining a work environment that recognizes effort and teamwork, values mutual respect and open communication, and demonstrates care and concern for our employees is essential to an engaged and productive workforce. In furtherance of this objective, we provide regular Code of Business Conduct training for our employees to identify and prevent misconduct and report situations that violate our policies and/or negatively impact our work environment. We investigate and take prompt action to correct conduct that is inconsistent with our Code of Business Conduct and other policies.
Health and Safety. Compliance with environmental, health and safety (“EH&S”) laws and regulations underlies the basis of the EH&S programs we have in place. During 2020, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees and contractors in response to the novel strain of coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic. These protocols included complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state, and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. During 2021, we updated our safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees and contractors in response to COVID-19 pandemic by mandating and requiring all employees and contractors to be fully vaccinated if they chose to work in the Company’s headquarters. For a detailed discussion of the

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part II, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations COVID-19".
Government Regulations
We are subject to various laws, regulations, and permitting requirements of federal, state, and local authorities, related to health and safety, anti-corruption and export controls. We believe that we are in material compliance with all such laws, regulations, and permitting requirements.
Anti-Corruption Export and Trade Matters
We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as the laws of the countries where we do business. We are also subject to various trade restrictions, including trade and economic sanctions and export controls, imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations. For example, in accordance with trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and the U.S. Department of Commerce, we are prohibited from engaging in transactions involving certain persons and certain designated countries or territories, including Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, unless authorized by OFAC or otherwise exempt from the regulations. In recent years, the United States government has a renewed focus on export control matters. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and regulatory guidance thereunder have imposed additional controls and may result in the imposition of further additional controls, on the export of certain “emerging and foundational technologies.” Our current and future products may be subject to these heightened regulations, which could increase our compliance costs.
See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors — Failure to comply with applicable anti-corruption legislation and other governmental laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal penalties and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” for additional information about the environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations that apply to our business.
Competition
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition from a number of companies, including other vendors of security screening systems. A variety of security screening technologies compete with our proprietary technologies, including, but not limited to walk-through metal detectors, handheld metal detector wands, and passive or active weapon screening systems based on magnetic field sensing, millimeter wave or terahertz imaging technology.
We believe that we provide the only proven touchless security screening products addressing customer requirements around throughput, visitor experience, and cost effectiveness. We are well-positioned to compete in our industry based on these core competencies and on the following competitive strengths:
•        Proven threat detection performance with low nuisance alarm rate
•        High throughput and superior visitor experience
•        Lower operating costs associated with the deployment of our solutions
•        Expandable digital platform able to provide analytics and insight to support customer operations, along with the ability to add additional capability over time
•        We have established commercial momentum as a provider of touchless security screening whereas a number of other vendors that claim capabilities in this area have struggled to do so
In addition, our deep technology portfolio and wealth of experience working with customers enables us to compete across a wide range of vertical markets.
