ITEM 1. BUSINESS    
Company Overview         
 
The principal business of LSC Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (“LSC Communications,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us”) is to offer a broad scope of traditional and digital print, print-related services and office products. 
 
On October 1, 2016 (the “separation date”), R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company (“RRD” or the “Parent”) completed the previously announced separation (the “separation”) into three separate independent publicly-traded companies: (i) its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business (“LSC Communications”); (ii) its financial communications services business (“Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc.” or “Donnelley Financial”) and (iii) a global, customized multichannel communications management company, which is the business of RRD after the separation.  To effect the separation, RRD undertook a series of transactions to separate net assets and legal entities.  RRD completed the distribution (the “distribution”) of 80.75% of the outstanding common stock of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial to RRD stockholders on October 1, 2016.  RRD retained a 19.25% ownership stake in both LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial.  On October 1, 2016, RRD stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 23, 2016 (“the record date”) received one share of LSC Communications common stock and one share of Donnelley Financial common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held as of the record date.  On March 28, 2017, RRD completed the sale of approximately 6.2 million shares of LSC Communications common stock, representing its entire 19.25% retained ownership. 
 

Merger Agreement 
 
On October 30, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Quad/Graphics, Inc. (“Quad/Graphics”), and QLC Merger Sub, Inc., a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Quad/Graphics (“Merger Sub”).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive 0.625 shares of class A common stock of Quad/Graphics, without interest and subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement.
 
The Company and Quad/Graphics have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement.  Subject to certain exceptions outlined in the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed to covenants relating to the Company’s business during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, including restrictions on its ability to issue any shares of its capital stock, repurchase any shares of its capital stock and incurring additional indebtedness outside the ordinary course of business.  The Merger Agreement allows the Company to continue paying a regular quarterly dividend up to $0.26 per share.  
 
On October 30, 2018, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company and the trustees (the “Trustees”) under the Amended and Restated Voting Trust Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2010, pursuant to which certain shares of capital stock of Quad/Graphics are held by the Quad/Graphics, Inc. Voting Trust (the “Voting Trust”), entered into a voting and support agreement (the “Voting Agreement”).  Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, the Trustees will vote all of the shares of Quad/Graphics held by the Voting Trust, which they have, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the voting thereof, in favor of the issuance of class A shares of Quad/Graphics common stock in the Merger, and against any alternative acquisition proposal involving Quad/Graphics or other action that would reasonably be expected to breach the obligations of Quad/Graphics under the Merger Agreement or the Trustees under the Voting Agreement, or otherwise reasonably be expected to delay or adversely affect the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
 
The Company and Quad/Graphics filed notification and report forms in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”) on November 13, 2018. On December 13, 2018, the Company and Quad/Graphics each received a request for additional information and documentary material (the “Second Request”) from the DOJ in connection with the DOJ’s review of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
 
3


Issuance of the Second Request extends the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after both the Company and Quad/Graphics have substantially complied with the Second Request or such later time as the parties may agree with the DOJ, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the DOJ. The Company continues to expect the Merger to be consummated in mid-2019.
 
Consummation of the Merger remains subject to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company stockholders, the approval by Quad/Graphics shareholders of the issuance of Quad/Graphics shares as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act and other required regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction or waiver of the other closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement.

Competitive Environment
 
According to the September 2018 IBIS World industry report “Printing in the U.S.,” estimated total annual printing industry revenue is approximately $76 billion, of which approximately $12 billion relates to our core segments of the print market and an additional approximately $31 billion pertains to related segments of the print market in which we are able to offer certain products. Despite consolidation in recent years, including several acquisitions completed by LSC Communications, the industry remains highly fragmented and LSC Communications is one of the largest players in our segment of the print market.  The print and related services industry, in general, continues to have excess capacity and LSC Communications remains diligent in proactively identifying plant consolidation opportunities to keep our capacity in line with demand.  Across the Company’s range of print products and services, competition is based primarily on the ability to deliver products for the lowest total cost, a factor driven not only by price, but also by materials and distribution costs.  We expect that prices for print products and services will continue to be a focal point for customers in coming years.  
 
Value-added services, such as LSC Communications’ co-mail, logistics and supply chain management offerings, enable customers to lower their total costs. Technological changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data, online distribution and hosting of media content, and advances in digital printing, print-on-demand and internet technologies, continue to impact the market for our products and services.  The impact of digital technologies has been felt in many print products.  Digital technologies have impacted printed magazines as some advertising spending has moved from print to electronic media.  Catalogs have experienced volume reductions as our customers allocate more of their spending to online resources and also face stiff competition from online retailers resulting in retailer compression.  Educational books within the college market continue to be impacted by electronic substitution and other trends. The K-12 educational sector continues to be focused on increasing digital distribution but there has been inconsistent adoption across school systems.  E-book substitution has impacted overall consumer print trade book volume, although e-book adoption rates have stabilized and industry-wide print book volume has been growing in recent years.  In addition, retail inserts have experienced volume reductions primarily as a result of store closures and reduced newspaper circulation.  Electronic communication and transaction technology has also continued to drive electronic substitution in directory printing, in part driven by cost pressures at key customers.
 
The future impact of technology on our business is difficult to predict and could result in additional expenditures to restructure impacted operations or develop new technologies. In addition, we have made targeted acquisitions and investments in our existing business to offer customers innovative services and solutions. Such acquisitions and investments include the acquisitions of Print Logistics in 2018 and Clark Group, Quality Park, Publishers Press, LLC, NECI, CREEL, Fairrington, and HudsonYards in 2017, which expanded our logistics, printing, digital, office products, and premedia capabilities, and Continuum Management Company, LLC (“Continuum”) in 2016, which expanded our print management capabilities.  These acquisitions and investments further secure our position as a technology leader in the industry.
 
Technological advancement and innovation has affected the overall demand for most of the products in our Office Products segment. While these changes continue to impact demand, the overall market for our products remains large and we believe share growth is attainable.  We compete against a range of both domestic and international competitors in each of our product categories within the segment.  Due to the increasing percentage of private label products in the market, resellers have created a highly competitive environment where purchasing decisions are based largely on price, quality and the supplier’s ability to service the customer.  As consumer preferences shift towards private label, resellers have increased the pressure on suppliers to better differentiate their product offering, oftentimes through product exclusivity, product innovation and development of private label products.  We have experienced robust growth within our e-commerce channel, where a significant majority of our sales are branded products.
 
We have implemented a number of strategic initiatives to reduce our overall cost structure and improve efficiency, including the restructuring, reorganization and integration of operations and streamlining of administrative and support activities.  Future cost reduction initiatives could include the reorganization of operations and the consolidation of facilities.  Implementing such initiatives might result in future restructuring or impairment charges, which may be substantial.  We also review our operations and management structure on a regular basis to appropriately balance risks and opportunities to maximize efficiencies and to support our long-term strategic goals.

Seasonality
 
Advertising and consumer spending trends affect demand in several of the end-markets served by LSC Communications. Historically, demand for printing of magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books and office products is higher in the second half of the year, driven by increased advertising pages within magazines, holiday volume in catalogs and retail inserts, and back-to-school demand in books and office products. These typical seasonal patterns can be impacted by overall trends in the U.S. and world economy.  
Raw Materials
 
We negotiate with suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies.  The primary raw materials we use in our printed products are paper and ink.  We negotiate with paper suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies and use a wide variety of paper grades and formats. In addition, a substantial amount of paper used in our printed products is supplied directly by customers.  Variations in the cost and supply of certain paper grades used in the manufacturing process may affect our consolidated financial results.  Generally, customers directly absorb the impact of changing prices on customer-supplied paper.  For paper that we purchase, we have historically passed most changes in price through to our customers.  Contractual arrangements and industry practice should support our continued ability to pass on any future paper price increases, but there is no assurance that market conditions will continue to enable us to successfully do so.  Higher paper prices and tight paper supplies may have an impact on customers’ demand for printed products.  We also resell waste paper and other print-related by-products and may be impacted by changes in prices for these by-products. 
 
We use a wide variety of ink formulations and colors in our manufacturing processes. Variations in the cost and supply of certain ink formulations may affect our consolidated financial results. We have undertaken various strategic initiatives to try to mitigate any foreseeable supply disruptions with respect to our ink requirements, including entering into a long term supply arrangement with a single supplier for a substantial portion of our ink supply.  Certain contractual protections exist in our relationship with such supplier, such as price and quality protections and an ability to seek alternative sources of ink if the supplier breaches or is unable to perform certain of its obligations, which are intended to mitigate the risk of ink-related supply disruptions.
 
The primary materials used in the Office Products segment are paper, steel and polypropylene substrates. We negotiate with leading paper, plastic and steel suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies.  All of these materials are available from a number of domestic and international suppliers and we are not dependent upon any single supplier for any of these materials.  We believe that adequate supply is available for each of these materials for the foreseeable future, although higher paper prices may have an impact on demand for our products. 
 
Changes in material prices, including paper and freight, may impact the Company’s operating margins as there may be a lag between when the Company experiences the changes and when they are absorbed by our customers. 
 
Except for our long-term supply arrangement regarding ink, we do not consider ourselves to be dependent upon any single vendor as a source of supply for our businesses, and we believe that sufficient alternative sources for the same, similar or alternative products are available.
 
Changes in the price of raw materials, crude oil and other energy costs impact our manufacturing costs. Crude oil and energy prices continue to be volatile. Should prices increase, we generally cannot pass on to customers the impact of higher energy prices on our manufacturing costs.  We do enter into fixed price contracts for a portion of our natural gas purchases to mitigate the impact of changes in energy prices.  We cannot predict sudden changes in energy prices and the impact that possible future changes in energy prices might have upon either future operating costs or customer demand and the related impact either will have on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.
 

Customers
 
Our printed products service retailers, including catalogers and merchandisers, publishers of magazines, books and directories and online retailers. Our customer base includes seven of the top ten catalogers in the United States, eight of the top ten magazine publishers in the United States, and all of the top ten book publishers based in North America.  Our printed products are distributed through the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) or foreign postal services or to our customers by direct shipment, typically in bulk, to customer facilities and warehouses.

Our Office Products segment primarily services office superstores, office supply wholesalers, independent contract stationers, mass merchandisers and retailers and e-commerce resellers. The products that make up our Office Products segment are distributed to our customers by direct shipment, typically in bulk, to customer facilities and warehouses.
 
For each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated and combined net sales.   
 

Technology, Research and Development
 
The Company has a broad portfolio of technology capabilities that are utilized in the delivery of products and services to our customers. We believe that proprietary technology is required where it will provide a competitive advantage or where the desired technology is not readily available in the marketplace, and, as such, our proprietary technology portfolio contains an array of applications and technological capabilities that were developed to perform different functions, including storefront, digital asset management and distribution, manufacturing systems, warehousing, logistics and list management services and data analytics solutions. Our technology strategy is focused on the continued investment in key technologies that support services and solutions that allow for creation, management, production, distribution and analytics of publisher content in multi-channels to maximize their distribution and return for each title. We are also focusing our technology capabilities on developments that will allow us to pursue strategic relationships and expanded services, such as our full supply chain management offering within our book platform.  Our continued activities in our Unified Technology Platform aligns investments across several offerings to support publishers including; order to cash for publishing, digital analytics offered through Harvest View, anti-piracy for publishers through our IntercepTag℠ solution and integrated warehouse offerings in our book fulfillment platform complementing our offset and digital print capabilities. To implement our research and development strategy, we expect to primarily invest in the maintenance and enhancement of our technology footprint within our facilities and in development activities that allow us to create new and differentiating technology capabilities.
Cybersecurity
 
Our cybersecurity program is designed to meet the needs and expectations of our customers who entrust us with certain sensitive business information. Our infrastructure and technology, expansive and highly trained workforce and comprehensive security and compliance program make us qualified to safely process, store and protect this customer information. 
 
Our infrastructure and technology security capabilities are bolstered by our relationship with a leading data center services provider. Furthermore, our networks are monitored by intrusion detection services around the clock, and our systems and applications are routinely tested for vulnerabilities and are operated under a strict patch management program.
 
We employ a highly skilled IT workforce to implement our cybersecurity programs and to handle specific security responsibilities. As a result of annual mandatory security awareness training, our IT workforce is qualified to address security and compliance-related issues as they arise. Additionally, all of our IT employees are carefully screened, undergo a thorough background check and are bound by a nondisclosure agreement that details such employee’s security and legal responsibilities with regards to information handling. We believe our security and compliance team also diminishes the risk of system compromise and data exposure by rapidly and effectively addressing security incidents as they arise.   
 

Intellectual Property
 
We consider patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights to be important to our business. We own over 150 patents worldwide, the majority of which are concentrated in our Office Products segment (utility and design patents), with the remainder falling into the following categories: 

• | Printing and binding patents: relate to manufacturing processes and systems used in the production of books, magazines and catalogs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Co-mailing patents: relate to combining printed publications in an efficient manner to achieve postal savings.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New media patents: relate to methods for creating and formatting digital content for electronic publications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also own over 350 trademarks worldwide, the majority of which are concentrated within our Office Products segment. Several of our most significant trademarks include registrations for the Adams, Ampad, Cardinal Brands, Oxford, Pendaflex, Quality Park, and TOPS office products brands. Additionally, we own the rights to a group of trademarks relating to our e-media publishing services, such as Newsstand™, LibreDigital™, LibreMarket™, LibrePublish™, and LibreAccess™.

While we consider our patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our profitability and operations are dependent upon any single patent, trademark or other proprietary right. 
 

Environmental Compliance
 
Our operations are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges to air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous materials, the cleanup of contaminated sites and health and safety matters. In the United States, these laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and Superfund (the environmental program established in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act to address abandoned hazardous waste sites), which imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party. We are committed to complying with these and all other applicable environmental, health, and safety laws, and in order to reduce the risk of non-compliance, we maintain an Environmental, Health and Safety management system that includes an appropriate policy and standards, staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues, and other measures. 
 
While it is our policy to conduct our global operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements, from time to time, our properties, products or operations may be affected by environmental issues. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that we may undertake in the future. However, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.  
 

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 22,000 total employees in the global workforce, of which approximately 18,700 employees were in the U.S. and approximately 3,300 were in international locations.  Of the U.S. and international employees, approximately 3% and 70% were covered by collective bargaining agreements, respectively. We have collective bargaining agreements with unionized employees in Canada and Mexico. We have not experienced a work stoppage during the past five years. Management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and collective bargaining groups.
