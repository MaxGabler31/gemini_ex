OVERVIEW
General
Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. (“BNED”) is one of the largest contract operators of physical and virtual bookstores for college and university campuses and K-12 institutions across the United States, one of the largest textbook wholesalers and inventory management hardware and software providers, and a leading provider of digital education solutions. Through our Barnes & Noble College (“BNC”) and MBS Textbook Exchange (“MBS”) subsidiaries, we operate 1,444 physical and virtual bookstores and serve more than 6 million students, delivering essential educational content and tools within a dynamic retail environment. Additionally, through our Student Brands subsidiary and associated websites, a leading direct-to-student subscription-based writing services business, we offer services to approximately 100,000 subscribers, by offering student assistance through the writing process and journey.
The strengths of our business, as discussed below, includes our ability to compete by developing new products and solutions to meet market needs, our large footprint with direct access to students and faculty, our well-established, deep relationships with partners and stable, long-term contracts and our well-recognized brands. We expect to continue to grow our business by introducing scalable and advanced digital solutions focused largely on the student, increasing market share with new accounts, and expanding our strategic opportunities through acquisitions and partnerships. 
As demand for new, enhanced, and more affordable products and services increase in the rapidly changing education landscape, we strive to evolve our business model and enhance our solutions. We continue to aggressively innovate and collaborate with our partners to provide solutions that extend well beyond course materials sourcing and sales, to include new digital services that support successful student outcomes. We aim to be an even stronger partner for schools and meet customer needs by expanding our physical and virtual bookstore service capabilities, courseware offerings and digital platform services. 
Technology-enabled learning is a rapid growth area in the higher education industry, as a growing number of students are enrolling in online services to complement print and digital course materials and classroom activities. We continue to enhance our digital content and services in an efficient, low-cost/high-value manner to complement our course materials business. The implementation of our core digital strategy relies on our direct access to students from our bookstore operations, where we can attach our existing and future suite of digital products and services both online and in our stores. 
We are ready to meet the digital demand with our virtual bookstore and e-commerce solutions. We focus on providing affordable solutions, such as our First Day™ inclusive access program, in which course materials, including e-content, are offered at a reduced price through a course materials fee, and delivered to students digitally on or before the first day of class. Additionally, LoudCloud Courseware™, is a turnkey solution for colleges and universities that offers advanced, affordable learning materials built on a high-quality foundation of OER or custom developed content from experts and faculty, as well as enhanced with digital content that includes videos, activities and auto-graded practice assessments that faculty can easily customize to align with class objectives. LoudCloud Courseware™ significantly reduces course material costs for students and enables easier implementation for faculty. 
We offer our Student Brands solutions focused on providing students assistance through the writing process and journey. We offer these online solutions to students via internet search engine optimization ("SEO"), as well as by marketing directly to students in our BNC and MBS physical and virtual bookstore footprint. 
We believe that our strategic actions over the past three years, including the acquisitions of LoudCloud Systems, Inc. ("LoudCloud"), MBS and Student Brands, respectively, and ongoing development of courseware, have substantially enhanced

our competitive position. Fiscal 2018 was a transformational period in which we began to leverage our newly-expanded customer base and distribution channels to broaden our reach to students and deepen our institutional partnerships. We continue to focus on providing product and service offerings designed to address the most pressing issues in higher education, including affordable and accessible course materials and products designed to drive and improve student outcomes. 
Strengths of Our Businesses
The major strengths of our businesses are as follows:

• | Ability to Compete by Developing New Products and Solutions to Meet Market Needs. We offer a comprehensive range of cost-effective alternatives for course materials. As demand for new, enhanced, and more affordable products and services increase in the rapidly changing education landscape, we strive to evolve our business model and enhance our solutions. We continue to aggressively innovate and collaborate with our partners to provide solutions that extend well beyond course materials to include new digital services that increase the likelihood of successful student outcomes.


◦ | First Day™. We offer our First Day™ inclusive access program, in which course materials, including e-content, are offered at a reduced price through a course materials fee, and delivered to students digitally on or before the first day of class. We have entered into several agreements with major publishers, including Cengage, McGraw-Hill Education and Pearson, to distribute their e-content through First Day™.


◦ | Comprehensive Suite of Course Materials. Our physical and virtual bookstores and accompanying e-commerce sites offer new and used, print and digital course materials, which are available to buy or rent. Through our MBS Wholesale business, we possess a robust inventory comprised of approximately 300,000 textbook titles in stock and maintain a comprehensive catalog of new and used textbooks and digital course material solutions.

Additionally, MBS was selected as a national distributor for rental textbooks offered through McGraw-Hill Education's newly announced consignment rental program (which includes approximately 230 titles) and Pearson Education’s expanded consignment rental program (which includes approximately 150 titles). Through its centrally located, advanced distribution center, MBS will offer the seamless integration of these consignment rental programs and centralized administration and distribution to more than 3,500 stores. These consignment rental programs will also be made available to MBS Wholesale customers, including institutionally run and contract managed campus bookstores, as well as BNC physical bookstores, and MBS Direct customers. 

◦ | LoudCloud Courseware™. Our courseware, utilizing open educational resources ("OER") and other expert sources, is a cost-effective solution enhanced with digital content that includes videos, activities and auto-graded practice assessments that faculty can easily customize to align with class objectives. In Fiscal 2018, consistent with our LoudCloud Courseware™ development road map, we expanded our courseware titles from 10 to 32 course titles, with sales to approximately 21,000 students at 40 colleges and universities, including technical colleges and online programs. LoudCloud Courseware™ significantly reduces course material costs for students and enables easier implementation for faculty. 


◦ | Student Solutions. Direct-to-student businesses focused on study tools, writing help, all centered around assisting students with the writing process and journey. Student Brands addresses writing pain points; students can search for a topic, develop an outline, and access authenticity technology. The content database allows students to leverage academic resources and references, with over 26 million essays across 4 languages representing more than 15 different countries, and receives more than 20 million unique monthly visitors to its sites. Student Brands has a substantial and growing community of online learners, with approximately 100,000 subscribers across its digital properties. We continue to aggressively expand our ecosystem of products and services through our own internal development, as well as by partnering with other companies to provide a complete hub of products and services designed to improve student success and outcomes.


• | Large Footprint with Direct Access to Students and Faculty. We operate 1,444 physical and virtual bookstores and serve more than 6 million students enrolled in higher education institutions and K-12 institutions. Through Student Brands and its affiliated websites, we extend our footprint directly to students as we offer services focused on writing help to approximately 100,000 subscribers using our digital properties, across 4 languages representing more than 15 different countries.


◦ | Social Hub and Customer Connections. At our physical campus bookstores, we serve as social hubs for students and their faculty, allowing us to forge deep customer relationships that help us drive awareness of our services and loyalty. For our MBS Direct and MBS Wholesale businesses, we are connected with our customers’ students online and through our proprietary systems. As a result of our proprietary data on students and textbook adoptions, we can develop prescriptive content and services to help students.


◦ | System Integrations with Our Higher Education Partners. We are deeply ingrained in the course material adoption processes of our customers and seamlessly integrate their systems with our technology. Both BNC and MBS have highly

7

Index to Form 10-K Index to FS

integrated technology that streamlines the adoption process for faculty, enabling them to research and submit textbook adoptions online. Our technology solutions support informed decisions made by faculty on course material selection, provide information regarding title and format availability and the cost to students. 

◦ | Understanding Our Demographics. Our multi-channel strategies focus on building close relationships and one-to-one connections with our students, faculty, administrators, and alumni, whether in-store, online, or mobile. We provide connectivity to our services whether our customers are in the classroom, at the stadium, or at orientation. We leverage and monetize our unique access to college students for third party brand partners looking to target the college demographic.


• | Well-Established, Deep Relationships with Partners and Stable, Long-Term Contracts. We have strong partnerships with college and university administrators, as well as with publishers, vendors, and suppliers. We strive to be the first stop for students, educators, and administrators by offering existing and prospective clients the most comprehensive solutions available with our flexible physical, virtual, and hybrid bookstore models.


◦ | Relationships with Colleges and Universities. BNC stores are typically operated under management agreements with the college or university to be the official university bookstore and the exclusive seller of course materials and supplies, including physical and digital products sold in-store, online or through learning management systems. BNC's management contracts with colleges and universities typically include five year terms with renewal options and are typically cancelable by either party without penalty with 90 to 120 days' notice. Our BNC campus bookstores have an average relationship tenure of 15 years. From Fiscal 2015 through Fiscal 2018, over 90% of these contracts were renewed or extended, often before their termination dates. Our BNC decentralized management structure empowers local teams to make decisions based on the local campus needs and fosters collaborative working relationships with our partners.

Virtual bookstores offered through MBS Direct operate under a contract with the school as the exclusive online seller of course materials. For the past three years, we have retained over 90% of our contracts annually, with the majority of the contracts being automatically renewed as per the contract terms or renewed before their expiration dates. MBS has developed deep relationships with its wholesale customer base as a result of its substantial inventory of used textbooks, a comprehensive catalog of textbooks, and superior service and systems support. MBS Wholesale sells hardware and a software suite of applications that provides inventory management and point-of-sale solutions to approximately 430 college bookstores.

◦ | Relationships with Publishers. We have long-term relationships with over 10,000 publishers, who partner with us to access one of the largest distribution networks of college and K-12 educational materials in the United States.


• | Well-Recognized Brands. The Barnes & Noble and MBS brands are virtually synonymous with bookselling, and we believe are widely recognized and respected brands in the United States. Our large college footprint, reputation, and credibility in the marketplace not only support our marketing efforts to universities, students, and faculty, but are also important for leading publishers who rely on us as one of their primary distribution channels.

Growth Drivers 
The primary factors that we expect will enable us to grow our businesses and profitability are as follows:

• | Scalable and Advanced Digital Solutions Focused Largely on the Student. The implementation of our digital strategy leverages our significant bookstore management assets, both physical and virtual, our student relationships, and our well established brands to help accelerate the adoption of our new digital products and services. Our physical and virtual bookstore footprint, and associated student relationships, present a sizable addressable market for the Company’s new digital products and services. By their nature, our new digital solutions are designed to be marketed and sold both inside and outside our physical and virtual bookstore footprint. We continue to enhance and invest in our digital content and solutions to complement and leverage our bookstore and wholesale businesses. The revenue from these services have higher margin rates due to the relatively fixed cost structure of these operations. 

Technology-enabled learning is a rapid growth area in the higher education industry, as a growing number of students are enrolling in online services to complement print and digital course materials and classroom activities, and we are ready to meet demand with our virtual bookstore and e-commerce solutions, our LoudCloud Courseware™ offerings, and our direct to student writing and learning solutions. We plan to leverage our physical and virtual product offerings by bundling our complementary digital solutions to improve student success and outcomes.
During Fiscal 2019, we will invest in our student success platform and proprietary content to drive our ecosystem of products and services.  In the future, our strategy is to aggressively grow the DSS segment via: (i) internally developed new products and services; (ii) through acquisitions of companies, products and services; (iii) and by partnering with other leading service providers, like The Princeton Review. Unlike other providers of digital services to students, our well-established, deep relationships with college and university partners, as well as our physical presence on campus, provides us with a significant competitive advantage as we roll out new products and services on the campuses and universities we serve. This integration 
8

Index to Form 10-K Index to FS

with the products and services from our other operating segments allows us to offer students new products and services in an increasingly relevant, cost effective, and targeted way.  The addressable market outside our physical and virtual bookstore footprint is an additional area where we plan to market these products and services to students.

• | Increasing Market Share with New Accounts. New store openings are an important driver of growth. In Fiscal 2018, BNC signed contracts for 33 new physical bookstores for estimated first year annual sales of $66 million. In Fiscal 2018, MBS signed contracts for 21 new virtual bookstores for estimated first year annual sales of $6 million. Currently, over 50% of college and university affiliated physical bookstores in the United States are operated by their respective institutions. We anticipate the trend towards outsourcing in the campus bookstore market, and we intend to aggressively pursue these opportunities to grow our BNC and MBS businesses. We evaluate each new contract based on established profitability measures to ensure we maintain a portfolio of profitable accounts. Our ability to offer existing and prospective clients physical, virtual and hybrid bookstore models is a key element of our competitive strategy.


• | Expanding Our Strategic Opportunities through Acquisitions and Partnerships. We intend to pursue strategic relationships with companies that enhance our educational services or distribution platform, or create compelling content offerings. Acquisitions and partnerships, such as Student Brands, LoudCloud and MBS, helped us expand into new educational verticals and markets, but other markets for expansion remain, including international markets. These will continue to be opportunistically evaluated.

Segments
Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we had two reportable segments: BNC and MBS. In connection with our focus on developing digital solutions, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company realigned its business into the following three reportable segments: BNC, MBS and DSS. Additionally, unallocated shared-service costs, which include various corporate level expenses and other governance functions, are presented as “Corporate Services”.
We identified our segments in accordance with the way our business is managed (focusing on the financial information distributed) and the manner in which our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses financial performance. The following summarizes the three segments, with additional information in each respective subsequent segment discussion.
BNC Segment
The BNC Segment is comprised of the operations of BNC which operates 768 physical campus bookstores, the majority of which also have school-branded e-commerce sites operated by BNC and which offers students access to affordable course materials and affinity products, including emblematic apparel and gifts. BNC also offers its First Day™ inclusive access program, in which course materials, including e-content, are offered at a reduced price through a course materials fee, and delivered to students digitally on or before the first day of class. Additionally, the BNC segment offers a suite of digital content, software, and services to colleges and universities through our LoudCloud platform, such as predictive analytics, a variety of open educational resources courseware, and a competency-based learning platform.
MBS Segment
The MBS Segment is comprised of MBS's two highly integrated businesses: MBS Direct which operates 676 virtual bookstores for college and university campuses, and K-12 schools, and MBS Wholesale which is one of the largest textbook wholesalers in the country. MBS Wholesale's business centrally sources and sells new and used textbooks to more than 3,500 physical college bookstores, including BNC’s 768 campus bookstores. MBS Wholesale sells hardware and a software suite of applications that provides inventory management and point-of-sale solutions to approximately 430 college bookstores.
DSS Segment
The Digital Student Solutions ("DSS") segment includes direct-to-student product and service offerings to assist students to study more effectively and improve academic performance, thus enabling them to gain the valuable skills necessary to succeed after college. DSS is comprised of the operations of Student Brands, LLC, a leading direct-to-student subscription-based writing services business, with approximately 100,000 subscribers across its digital properties, as well as tutoring and test prep services offered through our partnership with The Princeton Review. We currently offer these online student services directly to students, and increasingly will be leveraging our BNC and MBS physical and virtual bookstore footprint to market directly to students where we serve as the campus bookstore. We continue to aggressively expand our ecosystem of products and services through our own internal development, as well as by partnering with other companies to provide a complete hub of products and services designed to improve student success and outcomes.

BNC SEGMENT
General
The BNC segment is comprised of the operations of BNC which operates physical college and university campus bookstores, the majority of which also have school-branded e-commerce sites operated by BNC, offering students access to affordable course materials and affinity products, including emblematic apparel and gifts. BNC physical bookstores, e-commerce sites and digital platforms serve and interact with the key constituents in our business ecosystem and act as a key partner for students, universities and publishers.
Contracts
BNC stores are typically operated under management agreements with the college or university to be the official university bookstore and the exclusive seller of course materials and supplies, including physical and digital products sold in-store, online or through learning management systems. BNC offers existing and prospective clients the flexibility of physical, virtual and hybrid bookstore models. 
Agreements are typically five years with renewal options and are typically cancelable by either party without penalty with 90 to 120 days' notice. BNC pays the school a percentage of sales for the right to be the official college or university bookstore and the use of the premises; more than half of our agreements do not have any minimum guaranteed amount to be paid to our partners. In addition, BNC has the non-exclusive right to sell all items typically sold in a college bookstore both in-store and online. BNC also has the ability to integrate its systems with the university’s systems in order to accept student financial aid, university debit cards and other forms of payment. Over the past four years, BNC has renewed more than 90% of their agreements, with the majority of the agreements being renewed before their expiration dates.
Customers and Distribution Network
 As of April 28, 2018, BNC operates 768 physical college and university bookstores operations located in the United States, in 43 states and the District of Columbia. During Fiscal 2018, BNC opened 33 stores with estimated first year annual sales of $66 million, and closed 34 stores with estimated first year annual sales of $47 million. As of June 11, 2018, BNC has signed additional contracts for 21 new stores with estimated first year annual sales of $55 million, which are expected to open during Fiscal 2019 and expects to close 25 stores with estimated first year annual sales of $35 million. Closed stores are comprised of contracts that may have been lost in a competitive bid process, satellite store locations that we elect to close but continue to operate the main contract, and other contracts with low sales volume. We evaluate each new contract based on established profitability measures to ensure we maintain a portfolio of profitable stores. 
Product and Service Offerings
BNC's campus stores are social and academic hubs through which students can access affordable course materials and affinity products, including new and used print, eTextbooks, and e-content, which are available for sale or rent; emblematic apparel and gifts; trade books; technology; school and dorm supplies; café offerings; convenience food and beverages; and graduation products. The majority of campus stores also have school-branded e-commerce sites operated by BNC which offer the same products as the on campus stores. BNC offerings also include a variety of digital content, courseware and software and related services, such as predictive analytics, and competency-based learning solutions. Product and service offerings include:

• | Course Material Sales and Rentals. Sales and rentals of course materials are a core revenue driver and BNC's online platform and registration solutions are deeply ingrained in their partner schools’ textbook selection process. BNC works directly with faculty to ensure the textbooks they have chosen for their courses are available in all required formats before the start of classes. MBS’s wholesale distribution channel enables BNC to optimize textbook sourcing so they are able to more efficiently source and distribute a comprehensive inventory of affordable course materials to customers.

BNC offers its First Day™ inclusive access program, in which course materials, including e-content, are offered at a reduced price through a course materials fee, and delivered to students digitally on or before the first day of class. We have entered into several agreements with major publishers, including Cengage, McGraw-Hill Education and Pearson, to provide their e-content through First Day™, or directly to BNC campus bookstores and MBS Direct virtual bookstores. The seamless delivery is made possible by our First Day™ technology and publishers' technology integrations with campus systems. These initiatives provide students, faculty and institutions greater access to more affordable course materials.
In Fiscal 2018, we signed an agreement with McGraw-Hill Education, in which MBS was selected as a national distributor for rental textbooks offered through McGraw-Hill Education's newly announced consignment rental program. The program includes approximately 230 titles. Through its centrally located, advanced distribution center, MBS will offer the seamless integration of McGraw-Hill Education's consignment rental program and centralized administration and distribution to more than 3,500 stores. McGraw-Hill Education's consignment rental program will also be made available to MBS Wholesale

In Fiscal 2018, we had LoudCloud Courseware™ sales to approximately 21,000 students at 40 colleges and universities, including technical colleges and online programs.


• | eTextbooks. BNC has partnered with VitalSource, a global leader in building, enhancing and delivering digital content, on our digital reading platform and a broad digital catalog.


• | General Merchandise. BNC drives general merchandise sales through both its in-store and online channels and features collegiate and athletic apparel, other custom-branded school spirit products, technology products, supplies and convenience items. We continue to see significant growth in our general merchandise e-commerce sales, with year over year growth of 22.8% in Fiscal 2018. Additionally, BNC's Promoversity subsidiary's standalone e-commerce solution can serve any school, corporation or group looking for customized apparel, corporate gifts and novelties, and other merchandise.

As of April 28, 2018, BNC operates 87 True Spirit e-commerce websites, which are dedicated virtual stores that appeal specifically to the alumni and sports fan base. BNC also operates pop-up retail locations at major sporting events, such as football and basketball games, for our partner colleges and universities. The True Spirit e-commerce websites for athletic branded merchandise and the physical pop-up retail locations continue to build our partner schools’ brands through alumni and athletics, fostering school spirit and capturing the excitement of collegiate sports. We utilize event driven direct marketing strategies for events, such as tournament playoffs or homecoming events, to target an online population of students, alumni and sports fans, with emails and search engine marketing. 

• | Cafes and Convenience Stores. BNC operates 86 customized cafés, featuring Starbucks Coffee®, and 18 stand-alone convenience stores, as well as diverse grab-and-go options including organic, vegan, gluten-free and ethnic fare. These offerings increase traffic and time spent in our physical stores.


• | LoudCloud Platform. Through our LoudCloud platform, we address the growing demand for alternative forms of educational materials and learning tools. LoudCloud is a sophisticated digital platform comprised of learning analytics and competency learning solutions. Our LoudSight predictive analytics solution captures and analyzes key demographic, behavioral and performance metrics from students and provides real-time alerts, allowing educators to identify, monitor and support at-risk students to improve student success. LoudCloud's analytics solution connects disparate systems on campus, builds predictive models based upon data collected by institutions, and presents advisors with a unified view of the factors that drive student success on their campus. LoudSight has the ability to capture and analyze over 200 parameters across demographic, performance and participation data points.


◦ | Through our partnership with Instructure, a leading educational technology company and creator of the Canvas LMS, LoudSight can be fully integrated in Canvas’s platform, providing higher education institutions with actionable insights that provide a comprehensive view of the student journey. Instructure is a leading LMS provider at schools across the country, and we believe the ability to integrate with a school’s Canvas system makes our analytics solution more efficient and effective.


◦ | We entered into an agreement with Unizin, Ltd. ("Unizin") in Fiscal 2018 to provide its 22 member universities with LoudSight. As a result, faculty and advisors will have access to a customized solution that helps educators identify, monitor, and support at-risk students, with the goal of improving student success rates and retention.


◦ | We announced our strategic partnership with Portland State University ("PSU") to co-develop a degree planning solution. Using insights generated by PSU's reTHINK initiative and leveraging our analytics platform, the solution will ultimately help more students graduate on time with better pathways to employment and provide the university with long-term demand planning tools.


• | Brand Partnerships. Through BNC's unique relationship with students, colleges and universities, and our premier position on campus, BNC operates as a media channel for brands looking to target the college demographic, and derives revenue from these marketing share programs. BNC creates strategic, integrated campaigns which include research, email, social media, display advertising, on-campus events, signage, and sampling. BNC's client list includes brands, such as Chase, Target,

11

Masterpass, GEICO, DirecTV, Verizon, The New York Times and Tom's of Maine. Revenue from these services have higher margin rates due to the relatively low incremental cost structure to provide these services.
Merchandising and Supply Chain Management
BNC's purchasing procedures vary by product type (i.e. textbooks, general merchandise or trade books). Purchases are made at the store level with strategic corporate oversight, to determine purchase quantities and maintain appropriate inventory levels. After titles are adopted for an upcoming term, the BNC store staff determine how much inventory to purchase based on several factors, including student enrollment and the previous term’s textbook sales history. BNC uses an automated sourcing systems to determine if its stores have the necessary new or used textbooks on hand and may transfer the inventory to the appropriate store. Our acquisition of MBS significantly increased our textbook supply at competitive prices, as well as our ability to liquidate non-returnable inventory. MBS’s broad wholesale distribution channel and warehousing systems also drive inventory efficiencies, allowing BNC to optimize its textbook sourcing and purchasing processes.
After internal sourcing, BNC purchases books from outside suppliers. As part of its contracts with institutions, BNC generally guarantees that it will order textbooks for all courses. BNC's primary suppliers of new textbooks include Pearson Education, Cengage Learning, McGraw-Hill Education, MacMillan, and John Wiley & Sons. BNC's primary suppliers of used textbooks are students, through returns of previously rented and purchased books. The stores offer a "Cash for Books" program in which students can sell their books back to the store at the end of the semester, typically in December and May. Students typically receive 50% of the price they originally paid for the book if it has been adopted for a future class or the current wholesale price if it has not. Both unsold textbooks and trade books are generally returnable to publishers for full credit. For textbook sales and rentals, BNC utilizes sophisticated inventory management platforms to manage pricing and inventory across all its stores.
The larger stores feature an expanded selection of trade books (general reading) and use the Barnes & Noble, Inc. Book Master system, a proprietary merchandising system licensed from Barnes & Noble, Inc. BNC home office merchants meet with publishers on a regular basis to identify new titles and trends to support this changing business. 
General merchandise vendors and products are initially selected by home office merchants using the analytics and insights from BNC's planning and allocation systems. This data is used to establish benchmarks across school type, region and the demographics of each of our partner institution’s student base to help local store management team forecast sales and trends. 
Omni Channel Retailer and Customer Marketing Strategies
BNC obtains student and faculty email lists for direct communication which provides for seamless integration into the university community and potential co-branded marketing opportunities. BNC's ability to support and promote our partner schools’ brands strengthens and deepens our relationships with the administration, faculty, alumni, parents and students. BNC's omni channel strategies focus on building close relationships and one-to-one connections where our customers need us to be - in-store, online, mobile, at the stadium, at orientation, or wherever they are.
Faculty
BNC connects with approximately 390,000 faculty members who use FacultyEnlight®, our proprietary online platform which enhances content search, discovery and adoption (i.e. textbook selection), enabling them to find and select the course materials that are both relevant to their subject matter and affordable to their students. 
Students and Parents
BNC's Campus Connect Technologies™ platform is customizable technology that delivers a seamless experience, providing students and faculty with the ability to research, locate and purchase the most affordable course materials. The platform includes registration integration, learning management system integration, real-time financial aid platform, point of sale platform and course fee solution. Through BNC's fully integrated purchasing process, students can purchase their course materials in-store or online, or buy them when registering for classes through our Registration Integration solution.
BNC has flexible research channels that help us stay ahead of the rapidly changing needs and behaviors of our customers, and proactively respond with dynamic solutions. BNC's College InsightsTM platform connects with more than 8,000 college students, and helps us to create the ideal customer experience. BNC's marketing efforts are centered around an active digital community of over 6.8 million people, which includes engaged email subscribers and continuous dialogue with customers on our school-customized social media channels, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, as well as our student blog, The College Juice. BNC's exclusive Student Point of View ("POV") online panel and our Parent POV online panel helps BNC to better understand their attitudes, values and behaviors. Nationwide, during the current fiscal year, BNC has built approximately one million connections with incoming students and their parents.

Alumni
Additionally, BNC's access to alumni through university alumni offices, including over 1.3 million alumni with existing customer accounts, allow BNC to leverage digital marketing strategies on its dedicated fan and alumni e-commerce sites focused on athletic game day and other milestone events for further general merchandise sales growth in school-spirit apparel and related items.
Seasonality
BNC’s business is highly seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the second and third fiscal quarters, when college students generally purchase and rent textbooks for the upcoming semesters. Revenue from the rental of physical textbooks is deferred and recognized over the rental period commencing at point of sale. Revenue from the rental of digital textbooks is recognized at time of sale. 
MBS SEGMENT
General
The MBS segment is comprised of the operations of our MBS subsidiary, which we acquired in February 2017, and which operates two highly integrated businesses: MBS Direct and MBS Wholesale, as described below. MBS enables the Company to generate more value from the textbook marketplace through inventory and procurement synergies, increases our addressable market for digital courseware solutions and services, and allows the Company to offer existing and prospective clients physical, virtual and hybrid bookstore models, which is a key element of our competitive strategy. 
Contracts
Virtual bookstores offered through MBS Direct operate under a contract with the school as the exclusive online seller of course materials. Agreements typically have a term that ranges between 3-5 years, with automatic renewal periods. For the past three years, MBS has annually retained over 90% of its contracts, with the majority of the contracts being automatically renewed as per the contract or renewed before their expiration dates.
MBS Direct signed contracts for 21 new virtual stores in Fiscal 2018 with estimated first year annual sales of $6 million, and closed 57 stores. As of June 8, 2018, MBS has signed additional contracts for 25 new relationships in Fiscal 2019 for estimated first year annual sales of $9 million. Closed contracts are primarily comprised of contracts that may have been lost in a competitive bid process, as well as contracts with low sales volume. We evaluate each new contract based on established profitability measures to ensure we maintain a portfolio of profitable accounts. 
Customers and Distribution Network
MBS Direct
The MBS Direct business is the largest contract operator of virtual bookstores for college and university campuses, and K-12 schools, operating 676 virtual bookstores. Through contracts with its clients, MBS Direct operates as the institution’s official source of course materials with exclusive rights to booklists and access to online programs that link course materials to the courses offered by the school. MBS also operates Textbooks.comSM which is one of the largest e-commerce sites for new and used textbooks. This division is primarily for direct-to-student sales. 
As of April 28, 2018, MBS Direct operated 448 K-12 virtual stores (66%) and 228 Higher Education virtual stores (34%) in approximately 48 states, and District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In Fiscal 2018, sales from K-12 virtual stores were approximately 25% of total sales and sales from Higher Education virtual stores were approximately 75% of total sales.

MBS Wholesale is one of the largest textbook wholesalers in the country, providing a comprehensive selection of new and used textbooks at a lower cost of supply to more than 3,500 physical bookstores, including BNC’s 768 campus bookstores. MBS Wholesale sells hardware and a software suite of applications that provides inventory management and point-of-sale solutions to approximately 430 college bookstores. MBS Wholesale has deep relationships with clients due to the large inventory of used textbooks, a comprehensive catalog of textbooks, superior service and systems support.

enables MBS Direct to optimize its textbook sourcing so it is able to more efficiently source and distribute a comprehensive inventory of affordable course materials to customers. MBS Direct also digitally delivers cost-effective course materials via inclusive access programs to ensure students have their course materials on the first day of class. Similar to the BNC segment, MBS Direct partnered with McGraw-Hill Education and Pearson to offer their e-content through the inclusive access programs through the MBS Direct virtual bookstores. For additional information, see the BNC Segment discussion. 

• | Wholesale Textbook Distribution. MBS Wholesale centrally sources and sells new and used textbooks to over 3,500 physical college bookstores, including BNED’s 768 campus bookstores. MBS Wholesale's large inventory of used textbooks consists of approximately 300,000 textbook titles in stock, and it has a highly automated distribution facility that processes more than 13 million textbooks annually.

Additionally, MBS was selected as a national distributor for rental textbooks offered through McGraw-Hill Education's newly announced consignment rental program (which includes approximately 230 titles) and Pearson Education’s expanded consignment rental program (which includes approximately 150 titles). Through its centrally located, advanced distribution center, MBS will offer the seamless integration of these consignment rental programs and centralized administration and distribution to more than 3,500 stores. These consignment rental programs will also be made available to MBS Wholesale customers, including institutionally run and contract managed campus bookstores, as well as BNC physical bookstores, and MBS Direct customers.

• | Wholesale Inventory Management, Hardware and POS Software. MBS Wholesale sells hardware and a software suite of applications that provides inventory management and point-of-sale solutions to approximately 430 college bookstores.

• | LoudCloud Courseware™. LoudCloud Courseware™, a turnkey solution for colleges and universities, offers advanced, affordable learning materials built on a high-quality foundation of open educational resources and enhanced with digital content that includes videos, activities and auto-graded practice assessments that faculty can easily customize to align with class objectives. LoudCloud Courseware™ significantly reduces course material costs for students and enables easier implementation for faculty. MBS’s broad base of wholesale and virtual bookstore customers provides us with new sales opportunities for BNC's digital suite of course materials and platforms as discussed above in the BNC Segment discussion. 

Supply Chain Management
MBS Direct utilizes Course Director, a web-based product that allows faculty and/or staff to research, update, approve and submit textbook adoptions online, as well as support informed decisions made by faculty on adoptions based on real-time information regarding title availability, edition status and price. This real-time information is primarily sourced from the MBS Wholesale used textbook inventory. Using the MBS Direct system ensures that the fulfillment order is directed first to MBS Wholesale before other sources of inventory are utilized.
An extensive national sales force secures a steady supply of high demand used books, which is critical to the success of the MBS Wholesale business. MBS’s primary suppliers of used textbooks are students, through returns of previously rented and purchased books. MBS also purchases new and used textbooks from BNC, other bookstore operators, institutional bookstores, book dealers, publishers, other distributors and other wholesalers. MBS offers a "Cash for Books" program in which students can sell their books back to the store at the end of the semester, typically in December and May.
MBS’s broad wholesale distribution channel and warehousing systems also drive inventory efficiencies, allowing us to optimize our textbook sourcing, purchasing and liquidation processes. We can leverage MBS Wholesale’s distribution channel and warehousing systems to more efficiently source and distribute a robust, comprehensive inventory of affordable course materials to customers with the highest and greatest need. Through the proprietary MBS Database Buying Guide, we have access to the best maintained, most accurate, and most complete source of college textbook information available - a key asset that allows us to develop superior supply and demand insights and risk management capabilities.
Customer Marketing Strategies
Students

School Administrators
To market MBS Direct and Wholesale services, MBS maintains an active contact list of over 37,000 school management and administrators. MBS produces and distributes print and digital marketing campaigns to this contact list several times throughout the year. MBS employs a field sales and marketing force tasked with representing the entire MBS line of products and services to schools across North America. 
During Fiscal 2018, MBS built more than 56,000 connections with current and potential clients through its blog sites and social media presence, and had over 2.2 million visits to its primary business websites, mbsbooks.com and mbsdirect.net. These efforts have allowed MBS to capture market share and successfully engage administrators.
Seasonality
MBS’s business is highly seasonal. For MBS Direct retail operations (virtual bookstores), a major portion of sales and operating profit are realized during the second and third quarters, when students generally purchase and rent textbooks for the upcoming semesters. For MBS’s wholesale business, a major portion of sales and operating profit is realized during the first, second and third fiscal quarters, as it sells textbooks for retail distribution.
DIGITAL STUDENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT
General 
The Digital Student Solutions ("DSS") Segment includes direct-to-student product and service offerings to assist students to study more effectively and improve academic performance, thus enabling them to gain the valuable skills necessary to succeed after college. DSS is comprised of the operations of Student Brands, LLC, a leading direct-to-student subscription-based writing services business, with approximately 100,000 subscribers across its digital properties, as well as tutoring and test prep services offered through our partnership with The Princeton Review. We currently offer these online student services directly to students, and increasingly will be leveraging our BNC and MBS physical and virtual bookstore footprint to market directly to students where we serve as the campus bookstore. We offer these online services to students via internet search engine optimization ("SEO"), as well as by marketing directly to students in our BNC and MBS physical and virtual bookstore footprint. 
With the acquisition of Student Brands, the Company expanded its product portfolio with a complementary educational subscription-based product and gained access to a direct-to-student operation which can be leveraged to expand or introduce other products and services beyond the footprint of the existing college bookstore operations. Our physical and virtual bookstore footprint, and associated student relationships, present a sizable addressable market for the Company’s new digital products and services. By their nature, our new digital solutions are designed to be marketed and sold both inside and outside our physical and virtual bookstore footprint. We continue to enhance and invest in our digital content and solutions to complement and leverage our bookstore and wholesale businesses. The revenue from these services have higher margin rates due to the relatively fixed cost structure of these operations.
We continue to aggressively expand our ecosystem of products and services through our own internal development, as well as by partnering with other companies to provide a complete hub of products and services designed to improve student success and outcomes. We continue to innovate and collaborate with our partners to provide solutions and services in an efficient, low-cost/high-value manner that extend well beyond sourcing course materials and sales to include new digital services that support successful student outcomes. We plan to leverage our product offerings by bundling our products, with complementary solution services. 
During Fiscal 2019, we will invest in our student success platform and proprietary content to drive our ecosystem of products and services.  In the future, our strategy is to aggressively grow the DSS segment via: (i) internally developed new products and services; (ii) through acquisitions of companies, products and services; (iii) and by partnering with other leading service providers, like The Princeton Review. Unlike other providers of digital services to students, our well-established, deep relationships with college and university partners, as well as our physical presence on campus, provides us with a significant competitive advantage as we roll out new products and services on the campuses and universities we serve. This integration with the products and services from our other operating segments allows us to offer students new products and services in an increasingly relevant, cost effective, and targeted way.  The addressable market outside our physical and virtual bookstore footprint is an additional area where we plan to market these products and services to students.
Customers and Service Offerings
Student Brands provides writing services in a direct-to-student subscription-based model. The majority of subscriptions sold are one month in duration. Subscription revenue is deferred and recognized over the service period. Student Brands also generates revenue from digital advertisements. The revenue from these services have higher margin rates due to the relatively fixed cost structure of these operations.

Student Brands has a substantial and growing community of online learners, with approximately 100,000 subscribers across its digital properties, which include Bartleby.com, 123HelpMe.com, and StudyMode.com in the United States and TrabalhosFeitos.com, Etudier.com and Monografias.com in Brazil, France and Mexico, respectively. 
Student Brands addresses writing pain points; students can search for a topic, develop an outline, and access authenticity technology. The content database allows students to leverage academic resources and references, with over 26 million essays across 4 languages representing more than 15 different countries, and receives more than 20 million unique monthly visitors to its sites. Student Brands utilizes deep data analytics and artificial intelligence to drive its content management system, the "Content Brain". The study tools supplement the student’s learning ecosystem by assisting across multiple subjects and varied assignments on a digital platform.
Customer Marketing Strategies
The implementation of our digital strategy initially relies on leveraging our bookstore relationships, both physical and virtual, to help accelerate the adoption of our new digital products and services. By leveraging the BNC and MBS footprints among students and faculty, K-12 schools and higher education institutions, as well with our SEO efforts, Student Brands has substantially more opportunities to market the solutions students need to improve success in the classroom and beyond.
Seasonality
Student Brands' sales and operating profit are realized relatively consistently throughout the year, although quarterly results may fluctuate depending on the timing of the start of the various schools' semesters.
TRENDS, COMPETITION AND OTHER BUSINESS CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS
The market for educational materials is undergoing unprecedented change. Overall spending on education, including tuition, continues to increase dramatically. As tuition and other costs rise, colleges and universities face increasing pressure to attract and retain students and provide them with innovative, affordable educational content and tools that support their educational development. Current trends, competition and other factors affecting our business include:

• | Increased Use of Online and Digital Platforms as Companions or Alternatives to Printed Course Materials. Students and faculty can now choose from a wider variety of educational content and tools than ever before, delivered across both print and digital platforms. Students and faculty are increasingly relying on online and digital platforms as a means to discover, consume and share educational content and access affordable non-traditional educational content, including online coursework and supplemental materials. Whereas some companies are creating digital delivery systems that would seek to make traditional textbooks obsolete, others are developing new technologies to complement traditional offerings. Importantly, we have the ability to adjust and grow our digital offering efficiently to complement our printed textbook sales and rental business. Technology-enabled learning is a rapid growth area in the higher education industry, as a growing number of students are enrolling in online services to complement print and digital course materials and classroom activities, and we are ready to meet demand with our virtual bookstore and e-commerce solutions, and our LoudCloud Courseware™ offering.


• | Distribution Network Evolving. The way course materials are distributed and consumed is changing significantly, a trend that is expected to continue. The market for course materials, including textbooks and supplemental materials, is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change.


◦ | Disintermediation. We are experiencing growing competition from alternative media and alternative sources of textbooks and course-related materials. Significant changes in the distribution of course materials are already underway as a result of start-ups promoting free online textbooks, including OER, and generating revenue from related services, institutions licensing digital materials and providing them to students for a fee, or the surge of textbook rental programs in campus bookstores and online platforms. In addition to the official physical or virtual campus bookstore, course materials are also sold through off-campus bookstores, e-commerce outlets, digital platform companies, publishers, including Cengage, Pearson and McGraw Hill, bypassing the bookstore distribution channel by selling or renting directly to students and educational institutions, and student-to-student transactions over the Internet.


◦ | Supply Chain and Inventory - Since the demand for used and new textbooks has historically been greater than the available supply, our financial results are highly dependent upon MBS Wholesale’s ability to build its textbook inventory from suppliers in advance of the selling season. Some textbook publishers have begun to supply textbooks on consignment or rental programs which could impact used textbook supplies in the future. MBS was selected as a national distributor for rental textbooks offered through McGraw-Hill Education's newly announced consignment rental program (which includes approximately 230 titles) and Pearson Education’s expanded consignment rental program (which includes approximately 150 titles). Through its centrally located, advanced distribution center, MBS will offer the seamless integration of these consignment rental programs and centralized administration and distribution to more than 3,500 stores. These consignment rental programs will also be made available to MBS Wholesale customers, including institutionally run and contract managed campus bookstores, as well as BNC physical bookstores, and MBS Direct customers.

◦ | Price Competition. In addition to the competition in the services we provide to our customers, our textbook business faces significant price competition. Students often purchase textbooks and course materials from multiple providers, are highly price sensitive, and can easily shift spending from one provider or format to another. Some of our competitors have adopted, and may continue to adopt, aggressive pricing policies and devote substantial resources to marketing, website and systems development. In Fiscal 2018, our comparable store sales were impacted by lower average selling prices of course materials driven by lower publisher prices resulting from a shift to lower cost options and more affordable solutions, including digital.


• | Competition. In addition to the competition we face from alternative distribution sources, we also have competition from other college bookstore operators and educational content providers.


◦ | Competitors consist of other college bookstore operators and educational content providers. Competitors include BBA Solutions, a college textbook retailer; bn.com, the e-commerce platform of Barnes & Noble, Inc.; Chegg.com, an online textbook rental company and student learning platform; eCampus, an online provider of course materials; Follett Corporation, a contract operator of campus bookstores; IndiCo, an entity created by National Association of College Bookstores (“NACS”); Texas Book Company, bookstore management and operations; and Vital Source Technologies, Inc., a digital course materials provider. We also have competition from providers of eTextbooks, such as Apple iTunes, Blackboard, Google, and Redshelf, and various private textbook rental websites. At our institutions we serve, we face competition for predictive analytics and competency-based learning platforms, such as Civitas Learning, a learning analytics platform.


◦ | Competitors that provide online bookstore solutions to colleges and universities not only compete with our physical bookstore operations, but also compete with MBS Direct's virtual stores. MBS Direct also faces competition from Akademos, Ambassador Educational Solutions, Chegg.com; eCampus, edMap, EdTech, Follett Corporation, Texas Book Company, Tree of Life, and VitalSource Technologies, Inc. MBS Wholesale competes with Amazon, BBA Solutions, Follett Corporation, IndiCo, Nebraska Book Company, and Texas Book Company for new and used book inventory and distribution.


◦ | Competitors that compete with our general merchandise and convenience offerings include Fanatics, Sodexo & Aramark, online retailers, physical and online office supply stores, and local and national retailers that offer college themed and other general merchandise.


◦ | Our DSS segment faces competition from other digital student solutions providers that include Chegg.com, CourseHero, Grammarly, Quizlet, Noodle Tools, and Turnitin (iParadigms). As we develop a wider range of products and services, our competitive landscape will change and include other competitors in the broader student services market. 


• | A Majority of Traditional Campus Bookstores Have Yet to be Outsourced.


◦ | Outsourcing Trends. We continue to see increasing trends towards outsourcing in the campus bookstore market, including virtual bookstores and online marketplace websites. We also continue to see a variety of business models being pursued for the provision of textbooks, course materials and general merchandise. Contract costs, which are included in cost of sales, and primarily consist of the payments we make to the colleges and universities to operate their official bookstores (management service agreement costs), including rent expense, have generally increased as a percentage of sales as a result of increased competition for renewals and new store contracts. We continue to work on evolving our business model and enhance our solutions, as well as enforce our contract exclusivity, to combat increased competition.


◦ | New and Existing Bookstore Contracts. We expect awards of new accounts resulting in new physical and virtual store openings will continue to be an important driver of future growth in our business. We expect to continue to successfully renew our current contracts on favorable terms. We are awarded additional contracts for stores as colleges and universities decide to outsource their bookstore, and we also obtain new contracts for stores that were previously operated by competitors. Our virtual bookstore capability expands our addressable market to include schools that cannot or prefer not to have a physical campus bookstore. Sales trends are primarily impacted by new store openings, increasing the students and faculty served, as well as changes in comparable store sales and store closings.


• | Overall Economic Environment, College Enrollment and Consumer Spending Patterns. Our business is affected by the overall economic environment, funding levels at colleges and universities, by changes in enrollments at colleges and universities, and spending on course materials and general merchandise.


◦ | Economic Environment: BNC general merchandise sales are subject to short-term fluctuations driven by the broader retail environment. We expect general merchandise sales to continue to increase over the long term, as our product assortments continue to emphasize and reflect the changing consumer trends, and we evolve our presentation concepts and merchandising of products in stores and online. Lighter store traffic and a continued reluctance by the consumer to make discretionary purchases, along with a softer retail environment, has recently impacted our general merchandise sales. We are confident that our product assortment reflects consumer trends and have received encouraging customer response to

17

Index to Form 10-K Index to FS

our promotional and digital marketing efforts, especially as it relates to web orders. We are encouraged by the growth in our e-commerce sales and expect general merchandise sales to improve as the general retail environment rebounds, but we are taking a cautious approach given the overall uncertainty in the market.

◦ | Enrollment Trends. The growth of our business depends on our ability to attract new students and to increase the level of engagement by our current student customers. We continue to see downward enrollment trends and shrinking resources from state and federal government for colleges and universities. Enrollment trends, specifically at community colleges, continue to decline, led primarily by an improved economy and a dip in the United States birth rate resulting in fewer students at the traditional 18-24 year old college age. Consistent with projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, we expect undergraduate enrollment to increase in the long-term.

According to a Babson Survey Research Group report, over 30% of higher education students are taking at least one distance education or online course. Online degree program enrollments continue to grow, even in the face of declining overall higher education enrollment. Our comprehensive digital offerings, particularly with our LoudCloud Courseware™ program and the First Day™ inclusive access program, in which course materials, including e-content, are offered at a reduced price through a course materials fee, and delivered to students digitally on or before the first day of class, make us well positioned to capitalize on this trend.

In addition, we hired approximately 15,800 temporary employees during peak periods during Fiscal 2018. Our employees are not represented by unions, with the exception of 26 employees.
