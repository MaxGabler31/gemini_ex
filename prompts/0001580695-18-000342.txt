ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
 
Camber Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is an independent oil and natural gas company based in San Antonio, Texas. We are engaged in the acquisition, development and sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from various known productive geological formations, including from the Hunton formation in Lincoln, Logan, Payne and Okfuskee Counties, in central Oklahoma; the Cline shale and upper Wolfberry shale in Glasscock County, Texas; and Hutchinson County, Texas, in connection with our Panhandle acquisition which closed in March 2018 (described below). Incorporated in Nevada in December 2003 under the name Panorama Investments Corp., the Company changed its name to Lucas Energy, Inc., effective June 9, 2006 and effective January 4, 2017, the Company changed its name to Camber Energy, Inc.
 On December 30, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) to acquire, from twenty-three different entities and individuals (the “Sellers”), working interests in producing properties and undeveloped acreage (the “Acquisition”), which acquisition transaction was completed on August 25, 2016. The assets acquired include varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-Continent region. In connection with the closing of the acquisition, we assumed approximately $30.6 million of commercial bank debt, issued 520,387 shares of common stock to certain of the Sellers, issued 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to one of the Sellers and its affiliate, and paid $4,975,000 in cash to certain of the Sellers. The effective date of the Acquisition was April 1, 2016.
 
Our primary value drivers are our reserves, which must be developed to unlock their full potential. We believe the market conditions driving us toward the need for a larger entity of greater size and financial mass are even more essential in the current environment. In order to develop the significant reserves at our disposal, we believe that we must become, or become part of, a larger organization with ample cash flow and greater access to capital. Measures such as return on equity, liquidity and stock multiples have led us to conclude that the market, in general, views small-cap and mid-cap exploration and production companies as having greater potential than microcaps. The larger companies tend to have access to more favorable debt financing, receive greater analyst coverage, trade with greater liquidity and consequently, often have higher share prices. We are actively conducting workovers and subject to raising the balance of the funds due in connection with the October 2017 Purchase Agreement (defined and described below), which is subject to certain closing conditions described herein, the Company intends to acquire producing/non producing properties at value prices and participate in joint ventures with industry partners with the goal of enhancing production and cash flow.
 The Company also plans to execute a growth strategy by building on the platform and technical capacity created by our recent asset acquisitions described below, provided that the LOI defined and discussed below does not close. 
 
Our website address is http://www.camber.energy. Our fiscal year ends on the last day of March of each year. The information on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this report and should not be considered a part of this report. We refer to the twelve-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 as our 2018 Fiscal Year and 2017 Fiscal Year, respectively.
 
As of March 31, 2018, the Company had leasehold interests (working interests) covering approximately 19,985 net acres underlying a total of 78,715 gross acres in its two core regions, Central Oklahoma and West Texas. In Central Oklahoma the Company had 19,126 / 57,947 (net / gross) acres, most of which was acquired pursuant to the Acquisition (defined under Liquidity and Going Concern Consideration). Approximately 97% of the Central Oklahoma acreage is held by production (“HBP”). In West Texas, the Company had 859 /20,768 (net / gross) acres.
 
As of March 31, 2018, Camber was producing an average of approximately 842 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (“Boepd”) from over 100 active well bores. The ratio between the gross and net production varies due to varied working interests and net revenue interests in each well. Our production sales totaled 307,510 barrels of oil equivalent, net to our interest, for the year ended March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, Camber’s total estimated proved producing reserves were 2.92 million barrels of oil equivalent of which 1,565,270 barrels (“Bbls”) were crude oil and NGL (“Bbls”) reserves, and 8.15 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”) were natural gas reserves.

We have an experienced management team with proven acquisition, operating and financing capabilities. Through May 25, 2018, Mr. Richard Azar, served as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Azar has over thirty years of extensive oil and gas and financial management experience and since 1982, Mr. Azar’s companies have explored for, produced and operated over 1,000 wells in Central, South and West Texas and Central Oklahoma, including the development of the Hunton Dewatering Resource play in central Oklahoma. Effective May 25, 2018, Mr. Azar resigned as Chief Executive Order in the normal course of business and not due to a disagreement with the Company or in connection with any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. Effective on June 21, 2018, Mr. Azar resigned as a member of the Board of Directors.
 Effective May 25, 2018, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Louis G. Schott as Interim Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Schott has over 24 years of legal and business experience with 20 years in the oil and gas industry, including a strong background in restructuring, mergers and acquisitions, public company regulations and requirements, title, energy finance, business development, general negotiations and land. Mr. Schott’s recent restructuring experience includes restructurings within and outside of bankruptcy and both public, traded on the TSX and NYSE American, and private entities. At the time of his appointment, Mr. Schott was an advisor to the Company (a position he has held since December 2017) and is also an advisor to other companies in various stages of growth. Mr. Schott oversaw the operations of the Company pursuant to the terms of the Service Agreement described above under “Item 11. Executive Compensation” - “Service Agreement” from April to December 2017.
 As of March 31, 2018, Camber had no employees. We utilized contractors on an “as-needed” basis to carry out various functions, including but not limited to field operations, land administration, corporate activity and information technology maintenance.
 Broadly, Camber is targeting acquisitions in the southwest United States, inclusive of Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico, which represent a vast array of oil and gas deposits. As we consider producing properties, we plan to prioritize those with cash flow returns near our current assets that can substantially improve our bottom line. In addition, we will evaluate the property to determine whether it conforms to our experience and technical expertise. Specifically, we prefer relatively shallow (less than 10,000 feet) formations that require horizontal drilling techniques and significant surface infrastructure management, and we are currently evaluating several opportunities to expand our asset acreage. The ultimate success of each transaction will be significantly dependent upon arriving at acceptable terms and the availability of capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. 
 While actively pursuing specific exploration and development activities in the Mid-Continent area, we may not be able to close future acquisitions for a variety of reasons. We have recently made significant strides in improving production from our existing fields where our barrel of oil equivalent per day rates have risen from 617 boepd in March 2017, to a March 2018 rate of 842 boepd. Continued improvement in these rates should result in increased revenue and cash flow. 
 In the event the LOI, described and defined below under “Recent Events” closes, the Company may undertake a change in business focus and/or may seek to combine with another company.
 
Recent Events
 
Vantage Transaction
 
On August 2, 2017, and effective June 13, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Vantage Fund, LLC (“Vantage” and the “Vantage Agreement”), pursuant to which Vantage agreed to provide up to $6 million of funding to the Company, in the sole discretion of Vantage, with $400,000 provided in the initial tranche (the “Initial Tranche”). The consideration for the Initial Tranche of funding was the assignment to Vantage of all of the Company’s rights and ownership in its then wholly-owned subsidiary Camber Permian II, LLC (“Camber Permian”) which included leaseholds and potential participation rights in undeveloped oil and gas property known as Arrowhead. The Vantage Agreement contained customary indemnification requirements. On July 17, 2017, Vantage provided $120,000 to the Company under the Vantage Note and on July 20, 2017, Vantage provided $30,000 to the Company under the Vantage Note. Vantage was granted a second lien on the Jackrabbit property in connection with the financing. On November 9, 2017, in connection with the sale of the Jackrabbit Acreage, the Company paid Vantage the full amount due on the Vantage Note of $150,000.

Rogers Loan Default and Foreclosure
 
On August 13, 2013, the Company entered into a $7.5 million Letter Loan Agreement with Louise H. Rogers (“Rogers” and such loan, as amended from time to time, the “Rogers Loan”). As a result of various extensions and amendments thereto the Rogers Loan was due and payable on July 31, 2017. The loan was not paid when due and the cure period on the Rogers Loan expired on September 11, 2017. On such date, all principal, interest and unpaid costs thereunder were immediately due and payable (which totaled approximately $9.4 million as of the date of acceleration which amount included $2.1 million of default interest). Prior to the default, CATI Operating, LLC (“CATI”), the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary and obligor under the loan, had not recorded interest due on the note based on its earlier agreements. As a result of the default, demand and acceleration, CATI recorded the default interest demand of $2.1 million in the three-month period ended December 31, 2017. In September 2017, Rogers foreclosed on the assets of CATI which secured the note. On October 3, 2017, the trustee of those assets, for the benefit of the lender, sold these assets in public auction foreclosure sales which took place in Gonzales County and Karnes County, Texas. The proceeds from the foreclosure sales of approximately $3.5 million were applied against the outstanding indebtedness. The Company recorded an approximate loss on sale of property of approximately $4.1 million in conjunction with the settlement of the approximate $9.4 million of debt and accrued interest and the removal of approximately $1.3 million of remaining ARO.
 
On December 15, 2017, CATI entered into a Release of Mortgage, Deed of Trust, Assignment, Security Agreement, Financing Statement and Fixture Filing (the “Release”) with Rogers. Pursuant to the Release, the Company completed a transaction in which CATI provided Rogers, pursuant to an Assignment of Overriding Royalty Interest (the “Royalty Assignment”), with an overriding royalty (equal to 0.01 of 8/8ths of all oil and gas) on CATI’s remaining leasehold and Rogers released CATI from all remaining indebtedness owed. The Release, which was filed in various counties in Texas on January 22, 2018 and January 23, 2018, discharged approximately $5.8 million in principal and interest outstanding and owed to Rogers, according to Rogers. The effective date of the Release was December 15, 2017. Additionally, the remaining leasehold and ownership of CATI was assigned to Arkose Lease Partners, LLC, a third party (“Arkose”), pursuant to an Assignment of Membership Interest (the “Assignment”), dated November 1, 2017, in exchange for Arkose’s assumption of all plugging and abandonment liabilities of CATI of approximately $1.8 million.

The Sixth Closing, Seventh Closing and Eighth Closing occurred notwithstanding the terms of the October 2017 Purchase Agreement which required the sixth closing to be for a total of $5 million (the “$5 Million Closing”), as the parties mutually agreed to the sales of only $1 million of Series C Preferred Stock to be sold pursuant to the $5 Million Closing, at the Sixth Closing, Seventh Closing and Eighth Closing.
 
On March 2, 2018, the Company and the Investor entered into an amendment to the October 2017 Purchase Agreement (the “Amendment”), pursuant to which the Investor (a) waived any and all Trigger Events (as defined in the certificate of designation of the Series C Preferred Stock (the “Designation”)) that had occurred prior to March 2, 2018, (b) agreed that all calculations provided for in the Designation would be made as if no such Trigger Event had occurred, and (c) waived any right to receive any additional shares of common stock based upon any such Trigger Event, with respect to all shares of Series C Preferred Stock, other than any which have already been converted.
 
The Investor also agreed, pursuant to the Amendment, that the conversion rate of conversion premiums pursuant to the Designation would remain 95% of the average of the lowest 5 individual daily volume weighted average prices during the applicable Measuring Period (as defined in the Designation), not to exceed 100% of the lowest sales prices on the last day of the Measuring Period, less $0.05 per share of common stock, unless a triggering event has occurred, and that such $0.05 per share discount would not be adjusted in connection with the Company’s previously reported 1-for-25 reverse stock split affected on March 5, 2018.
 
The Company plans to use the proceeds from the sale of the Series C Preferred Stock for working capital, workovers on existing wells, acquisitions, repayment of vendor balances and payments to International Bank of Commerce (“IBC”).

Arrowhead Sale
 
On June 12, 2017, the Company received the initial tranche of $400,000 in connection with the Vantage Agreement. In exchange for the cash received, the Company assigned its interest held in Camber Permian in the undeveloped Arrowhead oil and gas property, with a book value of $114,500, to Vantage and granted warrants to purchase 64,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (see further discussion of these warrants in Note 10).

IBC Bank Loan Default and Forbearances
 
On August 25, 2016, the Company, as borrower, and Richard N. Azar II, our former Chief Executive Officer and former director, and who also received the largest number of securities and cash in connection with the closing of the Acquisition (“Azar”), Donnie B. Seay, our current director, Richard E. Menchaca, RAD2, DBS Investments, Ltd. (“DBS”, controlled by Mr. Seay) and Saxum Energy, LLC (“Saxum”, which is controlled by Mr. Menchaca), as guarantors (collectively, the “Guarantors”, all of which were directly or indirectly Sellers), and IBC, as Lender (“Lender”), entered into a Loan Agreement.
 
Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Lender loaned the Company $40 million, evidenced by a Real Estate Lien Note in the amount of $40 million. The Company is required to make monthly payments under the note equal to the greater of (i) $425,000; and (ii) fifty percent (50%) of our monthly net income. The note accrues annual interest at 2% above the prime rate then in effect, subject to a minimum interest rate of 5.5% per annum. The note is due and payable on August 25, 2019. Payments under the note are subject to change as the interest rate changes in order to sufficiently amortize the note in 120 monthly installments. The Company has the right, from time to time and without penalty to prepay the note in whole or in part, subject to the terms thereof.
 
The proceeds of the loan were used to repay and refinance approximately $30.6 million of indebtedness owed by certain of the Sellers, to the Lender (including an aggregate of $18.3 million owed by RAD2 and another entity controlled by Mr. Azar, $9.8 million owed by DBS, and $2.1 million owed by Mr. Menchaca), as well as to pay the $4.975 million due to the Sellers at closing. Another $3.36 million was used to fund a sinking fund required by the Lender, as discussed below, to pay principal on the note.
 
The amount owed under the note is secured by a Security Interest in substantially all of our assets and properties, pursuant to three Security Agreements. Also, each of the Guarantors guaranteed the repayment of a portion of the Loan Agreement pursuant to a Limited Guaranty Agreement. Additionally, in connection with the parties’ entry into the Loan Agreement and to further secure amounts due thereunder, certain of the Guarantors pledged shares of common stock which they received at the closing to the Lender, with RAD2 pledging 124,824 shares of common stock; DBS pledging 37,437 shares of common stock; and Saxum pledging 26,936 shares of common stock.
 
The Loan Agreement also provides that with respect to the properties located in Glasscock County, Texas, which the Company obtained ownership of at the closing of the Acquisition (collectively, the “West Texas Properties”), the Company has the right to sell the West Texas Properties after (i) the Lender approves the purchase and sale agreement in its sole discretion, (ii) the Lender receives as a prepayment of the loan, 50% of the sales proceeds of the West Texas Properties, but in no event less than $2,000,000, and (iii) the balance of the sales proceeds of the West Texas Properties are deposited in the bank account that we are required to maintain with the Lender, to be used to pay certain principal payments of the note as approved by Lender in its sole discretion.
 
The Company agreed to pay the Lender a loan finance charge of $400,000 in connection with its entry into the Loan Agreement, with half due on the date the Company entered into the Loan Agreement and half due on or before the 180th day following the date of the Loan Agreement. As further consideration for agreeing to the terms of the Loan, the Company agreed to issue the Lender 15,612 shares of common stock. The Company recognized a $2.8 million note discount related to these transactions and other debt issuance costs and will amortize the discount and debt issuance costs over the term of the note.
 
As of March 31, 2017, the Company was not in compliance with certain covenants of the loan agreement, including requiring the Company to maintain a net worth of $30 million, and the balance of the loan due to IBC of $38.3 million (less unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately $2.2 million), was recognized as a short-term liability on the Company’s balance sheet as of March 31, 2017. The Company has also recognized approximately $30,000 in accrued interest as of March 31, 2017.
 
On September 8, 2017, the Company received a Notice of Default and Opportunity to Cure (the “Notice”) from IBC, stating that the Company was in default under its loan due to failing to make a required $425,000 loan payment on August 25, 2017 (the “Payment Default”). The Notice was also sent to the guarantors under the Loan Agreement. The Notice also cited the Company for several covenant defaults including exceeding a cap on monthly general and administrative expenses; falling below $30 million of net worth; failing to comply with certain post-closing covenants regarding the assignment of certain oil and gas interests, the execution of certain supplemental mortgages and the completion of certain curative title requirements; failing to pay costs and expenses required pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement; failing to meet the requirements of a cash flow test as described in greater detail in the Loan Agreement; and exceeding the loan to value determination provided for in the Loan Agreement. In order to cure the Payment Default described in the Notice, the Company was required to pay $425,000, as well as any attorney’s fees and/or late fees as determined by IBC, on or before September 18, 2017, which amount was not paid and to cure the covenant defaults, which covenant defaults were not cured.

Pursuant to extension agreements entered into with IBC, in or around December 2017 and January 2018, (a) IBC agreed to waive the Company’s obligation to make the August 30, 2017, $425,000 monthly principal payment originally due under the IBC loan; (b) the Company confirmed the amount outstanding under the IBC loan ($37,443,308 as of each extension); (c) IBC agreed that interest only payments would be due on September 30, 2017, October 30, 2017, November 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, with principal payments of $425,000 per month to begin thereafter, which principal payments were not made; (d) the parties agreed that the amounts owed to IBC were payable on demand, provided that if no demand was made, such amounts would be payable by way of monthly payments of $425,000 of principal, plus accrued interest, with the remaining amount owed to IBC due at maturity (August 25, 2019); (e) that the amount owed to IBC will accrue interest at the rate of 2% per annum above the prime rate, subject to a floor of 5.5% (currently 6.25% per annum); (f) if the Company fails to make any payment due to IBC within 10 days of its due date, IBC is due a late payment of 5% of the amount past due (subject to a minimum of $10 and a maximum of $1,500 per late payment); and (g) the Company and the guarantors of the IBC loan released IBC from any claims against IBC as of the date of each of such extensions.
 
The Company subsequently paid the principal payments required as discussed above in February and March 2018, and has further paid all required interest due under the IBC loan through May 2018.
 
As of March 31, 2018, the Company was not in compliance with certain covenants of the loan agreement with IBC, including requiring the Company to maintain a net worth of $30 million and had previously defaulted in the payment of certain interest and principal payments which were required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the loan. As a result, the balance of the loan due to IBC of $36.9 million (less unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately $1.3 million), was recognized as a short-term liability on the Company’s balance sheet as of March 31, 2018. The Company has also recognized approximately $39,000 in accrued interest as of March 31, 2018.
 
Notwithstanding the above extensions, the Company is still in default under the IBC loan, the entire amount of the IBC loan may be accelerated and IBC may take action to enforce its remedies under the loan agreement. The IBC loan is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets and if IBC were to foreclose on our assets it would have a material adverse effect on our operations and may force us to seek bankruptcy protection.
 
Increase in Authorized Shares of Common Stock
 
Effective on January 10, 2018, the Company filed, with the Secretary of State of Nevada, a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of the Company’s authorized shares of common stock, $0.001 per value per share, from 200,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares.
Okfuskee County, Oklahoma Acquisition
 
In January 2018, we acquired approximately 3,000 leasehold acres in Okfuskee County, Oklahoma, including two producing wells and 7 non-producing well bores, in consideration for $210,000. The acquisition included three salt water disposal wells, to support existing and potential future hydrocarbon production.
1-for 25 Reverse Stock Split of Outstanding Common Stock

On March 1, 2018, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of all outstanding common stock shares of the Company (the “Amendment”). The reverse stock split was effective on March 5, 2018. The effect of the reverse stock split was to combine each 25 shares of outstanding common stock into one new share, with no change in authorized shares or par value per share, and to reduce the number of common stock shares outstanding from approximately 103.5 million shares to approximately 4.1 million shares (prior to rounding). Proportional adjustments were made to the conversion and exercise prices of the Company’s outstanding convertible preferred stock, warrants and stock options, and to the number of shares issued and issuable under the Company’s stock incentive plans. The reverse stock split did not affect any shareholder’s ownership percentage of the Company’s common stock, except to the limited extent that the reverse stock split resulted in any shareholder owning a fractional share. Fractional shares of common stock were rounded up to the nearest whole share based on each holder’s aggregate ownership of the Company. The effect of the reverse stock split has been retroactively reflected throughout this report.

Texas Panhandle Acquisition
 
In March 2018, we completed the acquisition of working interests in certain leases, wells and equipment located in the Texas panhandle and a 75% ownership of two partnerships that owned certain leases, wells and equipment in the same fields, for a total purchase price of $250,000, payable in three tranches, from an entity which is controlled by Ian Acrey who serves as the operating manager of our operations through a different entity. A payment of $85,000 was due at closing; $85,000 was due thirty days after closing and $80,000 was due sixty days after closing. Camber earned 25% of the working interest at the closing and earned an additional 25% of the working interest at each of the two subsequent closings. The seller retained a 25% carried working interest in the assets. The acquisition includes 49 non-producing well bores, 5 saltwater disposal wells and the required infrastructure and equipment necessary to support future hydrocarbon production as well as approximately 500 net leasehold acres in Hutchinson County, Texas. Camber is currently evaluating hydrocarbon production opportunities across all of the acquired acreage including the existing non-producing well bores for workover opportunities. An entity which was significantly owned by the operator of the Company’s other operated properties was the seller of the properties.
 
Disposition and IBC Assumption Letter of Intent
 
On June 25, 2018, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with an entity affiliated with Mr. Azar and Donnie B. Seay, our current director (the “LOI”). The LOI contemplates the Company and the entity entering into, among other agreements, an asset purchase agreement whereby the Company will transfer substantially all of its assets to the entity, reserving its assets in Glasscock County and Hutchinson Counties, Texas and will also retain a 12.5% production payment and a 3% overriding royalty interest in its existing Okfuskee County, Oklahoma asset, in consideration for the entity assuming all of the Company’s senior bank debt owed to IBC. The LOI is subject to various conditions, as are the transactions contemplated therein, including, but not limited to, approval of IBC and approval of the Company’s shareholders for the contemplated transactions.
 
Industry Segments
 
Camber Energy’s operations are all crude oil and natural gas exploration and production related.
 
Operations and Oil and Gas Properties
 
We operate and invest in areas that are known to be productive, with a reasonably established production history, in order to decrease geological and exploratory risk. With the closing of the Acquisition in October 2016, the Company acquired over 13,000 net acres in producing fields located primarily in the Mid-Continent region of Oklahoma including Payne, Lincoln and Logan Counties, along with a small amount of interest in production located in Glasscock County, Texas. The Mid-Continent assets produce from a liquids-rich, gas reservoir known as the Hunton formation. These properties include interests in four different fields, of which one is operated by Camber and the other three are non-operated.
 
In January 2018, the Company acquired approximately 3,000 leasehold acres in Okfuskee County, Oklahoma which includes nine currently producing wells and three salt water disposal wells (as described above).
 
Our Glasscock County, Texas properties produce oil and gas primarily from the Wolfberry, Cline and Fusselman formations and are all non-operated. In addition, the Company owns approximately 1,000 net acres and operations in the Permian Basin, Texas which it plans to sell or farm out.
 
In March 2018, the Company acquired 49 non-producing well bores, five salt water disposal wells and approximately 500 net leasehold acres in Hutchinson County, Texas (as described above).
 
We have steered the Company to a strategic path leveraging on our expanding technical and operational “dewatering” expertise. Since closing the acquisition of the Segundo Hunton dewatering assets in August 2016, the Company has sought an opportunity to expand its dewatering expertise to another productive formation. As a simplified explanation, dewatering occurs in formations with high water saturations, greater than 50%. The oil and gas resides in pore spaces of conventional subsurface rock formations and is held in place by the pressurized water. By producing the water (dewatering), the pressure holding the hydrocarbon in place is lowered, the hydrocarbon expands, and transitions from a residual state to a mobile state, allowing for commercial production. This concept is now being used throughout the Mid-Continent to produce large quantities of oil and gas.

The Company also plans to execute a growth strategy by building on the platform and technical capacity created by our recent asset acquisitions described below, provided that the LOI does not close. 
 
Marketing
 
We operate exclusively in the onshore United States oil and natural gas industry. Our crude oil and natural gas production sales are to gatherers and marketers with national reputations. Our sales are made on a month-to-month basis, and title transfer occurs when the oil is loaded onto the purchaser’s truck. Crude oil prices realized from production sales are indexed to published posted refinery prices, and to published crude indexes with adjustments on a contract basis.
 
We generally sell a significant portion of our oil and gas production to a relatively small number of customers. For the year ended March 31, 2018, our consolidated revenues were from the sale of oil, gas and natural gas liquids under marketing contracts primarily with Superior Pipeline Company, and Scissortail Energy, LLC. We are not dependent upon any one purchaser and have alternative purchasers available at competitive market prices if there is disruption in services or other events that cause us to search for other ways to sell our production.
 
During the year ended March 31, 2018, two customers accounted for 72.3% of our total revenues and during the year ended March 31, 2017, no one customer accounted for more than 20% of our total revenues. We do not believe the loss of any customer will have a material effect on the Company because alternative customers are readily available.
 
We actively manage our crude oil inventory in field tanks.
 
Competition
 
We are in direct competition for properties with numerous oil and natural gas companies and partnerships exploring various areas of Texas, Oklahoma and elsewhere. Many competitors are large, well-known oil and natural gas and/or energy companies, although no single entity dominates the industry. Many of our competitors possess greater financial and personnel resources, enabling them to identify and acquire more economically desirable energy producing properties and drilling prospects than us. Additionally, there is competition from other fuel choices to supply the energy needs of consumers and industry.
Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These regulations include requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining hazard prevention, health and safety plans; submitting notification and receiving permits related to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and natural gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface plugging and abandonment of wells and the transporting of production. Our operations are also subject to various conservation matters, including the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally limiting the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The effect of these regulations is to possibly limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.

In the United States, legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous federal, state and local departments and agencies issue recommended new and extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and natural gas drilling, natural gas processing plants and production activities, increasing the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Insomuch as new legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is common-place and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we may be unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with these laws and regulations. We consider the cost of environmental protection a necessary and manageable part of our business. We have historically been able to plan for and comply with new environmental initiatives without materially altering our operating strategies.
 
Insurance Matters
 
We maintain insurance coverage which we believe is reasonable per the standards of the oil and natural gas industry. It is common for companies in this industry to not insure fully against all risks associated with their operations either because such insurance is unavailable or because premium costs are considered prohibitive. A material loss not fully covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We maintain insurance at industry customary levels to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and accidental discharges of certain prohibited substances into the environment. Such insurance might not cover the complete amount of such a claim and would not cover fines or penalties for a violation of an environmental law.
Other Matters
 
Environmental. Our exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas, including our operation of saltwater injection and disposal wells, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations can increase the costs of planning, designing, installing and operating oil, natural gas, and disposal wells. Our domestic activities are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), and the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), as well as state regulations promulgated under comparable state statutes. We are also subject to regulations governing the handling, transportation, storage, and disposal of naturally occurring radioactive materials that are found in our oil and gas operations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Additionally, these laws and regulations require the acquisition of permits or other governmental authorizations before undertaking certain activities, limit or prohibit other activities because of protected areas or species, and impose substantial liabilities for cleanup of pollution.
 
Under the OPA, a release of oil into water or other areas designated by the statute could result in us being held responsible for the costs of remediating such a release, certain OPA specified damages, and natural resource damages. The extent of that liability could be extensive, as set forth in the statute, depending on the nature of the release. A release of oil in harmful quantities or other materials into water or other specified areas could also result in us being held responsible under the CWA for the costs of remediation, and civil and criminal fines and penalties.
 
CERCLA and comparable state statutes, also known as “Superfund” laws, can impose joint and several and retroactive liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. In practice, cleanup costs are usually allocated among various responsible parties. Potentially liable parties include site owners or operators, past owners or operators under certain conditions, and entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of, or transport hazardous substances found at the site. Although CERCLA, as amended, currently exempts petroleum, including but not limited to, crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, from the definition of hazardous substance, our operations may involve the use or handling of other materials that may be classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA. Furthermore, the exemption may not be preserved in future amendments of the act, if any.

RCRA and comparable state and local requirements impose standards for the management, including treatment, storage, and disposal, of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. We generate hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste in connection with our routine operations. From time to time, proposals have been made that would reclassify certain oil and natural gas wastes, including wastes generated during drilling, production and pipeline operations, as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA, which would make such solid wastes subject to much more stringent handling, transportation, storage, disposal, and clean-up requirements. This development could have a significant impact on our operating costs. While state laws vary on this issue, state initiatives to further regulate oil and natural gas wastes could have a similar impact. Because oil and natural gas exploration and production, and possibly other activities, have been conducted at some of our properties by previous owners and operators, materials from these operations remain on some of the properties and in some instances, require remediation. In addition, in certain instances, we have agreed to indemnify sellers of producing properties from which we have acquired reserves against certain liabilities for environmental claims associated with such properties. While we do not believe that costs to be incurred by us for compliance and remediating previously or currently owned or operated properties will be material, there can be no guarantee that such costs will not result in material expenditures.
 
Additionally, in the course of our routine oil and natural gas operations, surface spills and leaks, including casing leaks, of oil or other materials occur, and we incur costs for waste handling and environmental compliance. Moreover, we are able to control directly the operations of only those wells for which we act as the operator. Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
 
In response to liabilities associated with these activities, accruals are established when reasonable estimates are possible. Such accruals would primarily include estimated costs associated with remediation. We have used discounting to present value in determining our accrued liabilities for environmental remediation or well closure, but no material claims for possible recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental costs have been recognized in our financial statements. We adjust the accruals when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information.
 
We do not anticipate being required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to our total capital expenditures program by reason of environmental laws and regulations, but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. More stringent laws and regulations protecting the environment may be adopted in the future and we may incur material expenses in connection with environmental laws and regulations in the future.
 
Occupational Health and Safety. We are also subject to laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health. Due to the continued changes in these laws and regulations, and the judicial construction of many of them, we are unable to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future costs of complying with these laws and regulations. We consider the cost of safety and health compliance a necessary and manageable part of our business. We have been able to plan for and comply with new initiatives without materially altering our operating strategies.
Hydraulic Fracturing. Vast quantities of natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil deposits exist in deep shale and other unconventional formations. It is customary in our industry to recover these resources through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks, or fractures, in deep underground formations using water, sand and other additives pumped under high pressure into the formation. As with the rest of the industry, we use hydraulic fracturing as a means to increase the productivity of almost every well that we drill and complete. These formations are generally geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by thousands of feet of impermeable rock layers. We follow applicable legal requirements for groundwater protection in our operations that are subject to supervision by state and federal regulators (including the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) on federal acreage). Furthermore, our well construction practices require the installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers by preventing the migration of fracturing fluids into aquifers.
 
Injection rates and pressures are required to be monitored in real time at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is required to be monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. Hydraulic fracturing operations are required to be shut down if an abrupt change occurs to the injection pressure or annular pressure. These aspects of hydraulic fracturing operations are designed to prevent a pathway for the fracturing fluid to contact any aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations.

Hydraulic fracture stimulation requires the use of water. We use fresh water or recycled produced water in our fracturing treatments in accordance with applicable water management plans and laws. Several proposals have previously been presented to the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states have previously considered, or are currently considering, legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to earthquakes. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so.
 
Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it prohibitive to conduct our operations, and also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities from our properties.
 
The Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect areas that contain endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our assets and lease acreage may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species in areas where we intend to conduct construction activity could materially limit or delay our plans.
Global Warming and Climate Change. Various state governments and regional organizations are considering enacting new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases from stationary sources such as our equipment and operations. Legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require us to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the natural gas and oil that we sell. The potential increase in our operating costs could include new or increased costs to obtain permits, operate and maintain our equipment and facilities, install new emission controls on our equipment and facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program.
Taxation. Our operations, as is the case in the petroleum industry generally, are significantly affected by federal tax laws. Federal, as well as state, tax laws have many provisions applicable to corporations which could affect our future tax liabilities.
Commitments and Contingencies. We are liable for future restoration and abandonment costs associated with our oil and gas properties. These costs include future site restoration, post closure and other environmental exit costs. The costs of future restoration and well abandonment have not been determined in detail. State regulations require operators to post bonds that assure that well sites will be properly plugged and abandoned. We currently operate only in Texas and Oklahoma, which require a security bond based on the number of wells we operate. Management views this as a necessary requirement for operations and does not believe that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our financial position as a result of this requirement.

Prospect. A specific geographic area which, based on supporting geological, geophysical or other data and also preliminary economic analysis using reasonably anticipated prices and costs, is considered to have potential for the discovery of commercial hydrocarbons.
 
Proved developed reserves. Proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and facilities and by existing operating methods.
 
Proved reserves. Reserves of oil and natural gas that have been proved to a high degree of certainty by analysis of the producing history of a reservoir and/or by volumetric analysis of adequate geological and engineering data.

Royalty interest. An interest in an oil and natural gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage (or of the proceeds of the sale thereof), but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage. Royalties may be either landowner’s royalties, which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted, or overriding royalties, which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner.
 
2-D seismic. The method by which a cross-section of the earth’s subsurface is created through the interpretation of reflecting seismic data collected along a single source profile.
 
3-D seismic. The method by which a three-dimensional image of the earth’s subsurface is created through the interpretation of reflection seismic data collected over a surface grid. 3-D seismic surveys allow for a more detailed understanding of the subsurface than do 2-D seismic surveys and contribute significantly to field appraisal, exploitation and production.
 
Trend. A region of oil and/or natural gas production, the geographic limits of which have not been fully defined, having geological characteristics that have been ascertained through supporting geological, geophysical or other data to contain the potential for oil and/or natural gas reserves in a particular formation or series of formations.
 
Unconventional resource play. A set of known or postulated oil and or natural gas resources or reserves warranting further exploration which are extracted from (a) low-permeability sandstone and shale formations and (b) coalbed methane. These plays require the application of advanced technology to extract the oil and natural gas resources.
 
Undeveloped acreage. Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.
