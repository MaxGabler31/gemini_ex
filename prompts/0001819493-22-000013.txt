Item 1. Business
Overview
Xos, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Xos”) is a mobility solutions company manufacturing Class 5 to 8 battery-electric commercial vehicles. We facilitate the transition of fleets from internal combustion engine vehicles to zero-emission vehicles with proprietary technology suited to the commercial use case. We also provide a range of services to facilitate the transition of fleets to electric vehicles, including charging infrastructure, vehicle maintenance, financing and service.
Our Mission
Our mission is to decarbonize commercial transportation by developing innovative technologies and intelligent mobility solutions at the intersection of transportation, energy and software. 
Our Products 
We developed the X-Pack (our proprietary battery system) and the X-Platform (our proprietary, purpose-built vehicle chassis platform) specifically for the medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle segment with a focus on last-mile commercial fleet operations. We offer our powertrain technology along with design and integration expertise to other original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in the commercial, off-highway and industrial markets under our “Power by Xos” powertrain . In addition, our “Fleet-as-a-Service” offer our customers a comprehensive suite of commercial products and services to facilitate electric fleet operations and seamlessly transition their traditional combustion-engine fleets to battery-electric vehicles.
Our X-Pack and X-Platform provide modular features that allow us to accommodate a wide range of last-mile applications and enable us to offer clients industry-leading total cost of ownership. The X-Platform, our chassis platform, and X-Pack, our battery technology, are available for purchase as part of Xos vehicles. The X-Platform and X-Pack were both engineered to be modular in nature to allow fleet operators to customize vehicles to fit their commercial applications (e.g., upfitting with a specific vehicle body and/or tailoring battery range). In addition to a competitive vehicle purchase price, our technology can also drive savings throughout ownership through increased vehicle uptime, greater payload capacity and reduced service and maintenance expense. Ninety percent of vehicles in our targeted segments operate on routes under 200 miles per shift (referred to as “last-mile” routes). Vehicles that fulfill these predictable last-mile routes generally return to base hubs on a daily basis. Such vehicles are ideal candidates for electrification as operators are able to connect them to dedicated charging infrastructure at return-to-base hubs. Our modular and cost-effective vehicles have been on the road and in customers’ hands since 2018, further validating the durability of satisfaction with our vehicles. 
Our powertrain solution is targeted at commercial, off-highway and industrial markets. We provide customers with proprietary powertrain technology and robust components, purpose-designed for the rigors of commercial use. Xos’ powertrain offerings include a broad range of solutions including high voltage batteries, power distribution and management componentry, battery management systems, system controls, inverters, electric traction motors, auxiliary drive systems, in addition to robust engineering, design, and integration services.
Our Fleet-as-a-Service facilitate the transition from traditional internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles to battery electric vehicles and provides fleet operators with a comprehensive set of solutions and products (including, but not limited to, Energy 
Services, service and maintenance, vehicle telematics, over-the-air updates and financing) to transition to and to operate an electric fleet. This product offering will combine traditionally disaggregated services into a bundled service package, thus reducing the cost and friction associated with electrifying commercial fleets. Services to be offered in our Fleet-as-a-Service include our proprietary technology and in-house services (X-Platform, digital fleet management products, over-the-air software update technology, and a wide-range of service products) and offerings from our industry leading partners. Fleet-as-a-Service is expected to increase the lifetime revenue of each vehicle sold by us. 
We believe our growth in the coming years is supported by the strong secular tailwinds of an increased focus on the impact of climate change and the growth of e-commerce and last-mile delivery. Commercial trucks are the largest emitters of greenhouse gasses per capita in the transportation industry. The U.S. federal, state and foreign governments, along with corporations such as FedEx, Amazon and UPS, have set ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Simultaneously, e-commerce continues to grow rapidly and has been accelerated by changes in consumer purchasing behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the increased regulation relating to commercial vehicles, the launch of sustainability initiatives from leading financial and corporate institutions and the rapid growth of last-mile logistics will fuel accelerated adoption of our products worldwide.
Industry Background
Commercial trucks in the United States emit as much greenhouse gas (“GHG”) per year as cars (approximately 750 million tons of GHG or 41% of all GHG emitted from transportation), despite traveling less than 45% the total distance of cars. Governments, corporations and investors are making concerted efforts and setting aggressive targets to phase out fossil fuel use and reduce GHG emissions. Such initiatives include setting timelines for zero-emission targets, establishing caps on CO2 emissions, and instituting certain other environmental sustainability initiatives.
In the U.S. the Biden Administration has declared the following key environmental targets: (i) a carbon-free power sector by 2035, (ii) a net-zero (i.e. carbon reduction is equal to or greater than carbon emissions) economy by 2050 and (iii) the transition of the U.S. federal government’s vehicle fleet to clean electric vehicle alternatives. Individual states have furthered the push for clean energy mobile solutions. In addition, Congress is currently considering the Build Back Better Act which has proposals to enhance battery processing and manufacturing and also advanced energy manufacturing and recycling grant program, which would support the transition of fleets to zero-emissions. California, the most populous U.S. state, issued Executive Order N-79-20 in September 2020, which requires that 100% of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles sales be zero-emission by 2035. Executive Order N-79-20 targets 100% of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles in operation to be zero-emission by 2045. California has also mandated that three percent (3%) of model-year 2024 heavy-duty vehicles sold in-state be zero-emission vehicles (“ZEV”), with such percentage increasing to 15% by 2030.
Additionally, approximately 20 other countries, including Canada and France, have committed to the phaseout of combustible engine vehicles by 2040 and substitution of ICE vehicles with zero-emission alternatives. On February 18, 2019, the European Union agreed to impose a cap on commercial truck CO2 emissions, and numerous European countries have introduced incentives to promote electric vehicle sales. Emissions targets in the region remain aggressive in the face of the global pandemic, with heavy-duty vehicles required to reduce emissions by 15% in 2025 and by 30% in 2030. Failure to comply with the 2025 target may result in a fine of up to €38K per vehicle, further incentivizing fleets to transition to electric vehicles.
Leading financial and corporate institutions have also committed to environmental sustainability initiatives. A 2021 letter to CEOs from Larry Fink — Chairman and CEO of Blackrock — requested that all boards of directors prepare and disclose a plan to be compatible with a net-zero economy and to commit to launching investment products aligned to a net-zero pathway. Established carriers (such as FedEx, DHL and UPS) and leading last-mile fleets (such as Amazon) announced commitments to explore alternative fuel solutions and reduce their respective carbon footprints. FedEx announced a goal to achieve carbon-neutral operations by 2040 and designated more than $2 billion of initial investment to vehicle electrification, sustainable energy and carbon sequestration. DHL has committed to reduce its emissions by 50% by 2025. It plans to achieve such goal by employing clean pick-up and delivery solutions for 70% of its first- and last-mile operations and further pledged to eliminate all logistics-related emissions by 2050. In 2019 UPS, as a part of its sustainability goals, announced plans to invest $450 million within a three-year period through 2022 to expand its alternative fuel vehicle fleet and infrastructure. In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge — a commitment to achieve company-wide net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.
Our Market Opportunity
Our target market, which includes global last-mile Class 5 to 8 vehicle sales (excluding China), accounts for approximately 800,000 annual vehicle sales and a total addressable market of $100 billion, of which $34 billion is attributed to the United States (which reflects an assumed average selling price applied to medium-duty and 20% of heavy-duty commercial truck sales assumed to be used for last-mile applications) in 2021. The global last-mile delivery market is expected to grow to approximately $424 billion by 2030, representing a CAGR of 10% from 2022 to 2030. Same-day delivery is expected to have a 25% market share by 2025. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated demand in the last-mile segment due to an increase in shipping volumes and consumer expectations for shortened delivery times. To address heightened demand and evolving customer expectations, delivery fulfillment centers continue to be positioned near end customers. The emphasis on fulfillment center proximity to end-use consumers has been a factor in driving an estimated 34% reduction in the average route length since 2000 and an increase in the number of last-mile routes. 
We believe the last-mile delivery segment is a prime market for electrification for the following reasons:
•Technology Alignment. Short- and medium-haul routes better align with the range, weight and charging parameters of battery-electric technology compared to long-haul routes that require increased battery capacities to meet range requirements. Allocating more weight to battery systems in long-haul vehicles in turn reduces payload capacity. Furthermore, short and medium driving distances with frequent stop-and-go duty cycles can increase fuel economy by 30-40% and reduce maintenance costs by up to 30% compared to traditional diesel alternatives. In addition, many short- and medium-haul routes feature diminishing loads in which the vehicle becomes lighter as the route progresses, which in turn extends vehicle range.
•Infrastructure Capabilities. Our focus on the return-to-base vehicle segment allows us and our customers to deploy charging stations at established local depots rather than route-based charging points. Last-mile vehicles often operate in shifts. Such shift-based operation allows for recharge periods and reduces the need for quick-charge capabilities, which can negatively impact long-term battery health.
•Battery Range Optimization. Predictable routes allow fleets to optimize for battery range, reduce the overall cost of the vehicle, maximize payload and increase energy efficiency by avoiding unnecessary battery packs to accommodate unforeseen range requirements. Alignment between battery capacity needs and battery system hardware helps improve TCO.
•Population Dense Markets. Last-mile routes are typically located in high-density geographies and in closer proximity to end customers. Electric vehicles emit less GHG compared to fossil fuel vehicles, which not only has a positive environmental impact, but also reduces certain health issues associated with air pollutants.
•Regulatory Support and Market Tailwinds. Ambitious environmental regulations and goals set by financial and corporate institutions are primed to accelerate the shift from diesel and gasoline trucks to electric or other alternative fuel vehicles.
We believe that the medium- and heavy-duty last-mile commercial segment remains relatively underserved with many ZEV OEMs focusing on addressing other commercial transportation applications, such as light-duty package cars and long-haul transportation. 
In addition to the growing market opportunity related to vehicle sales, we anticipate opportunities through our Fleet-as-a-Service product. Our Fleet-as-a-Service package includes products sold at the point-of-sale (“POS”) and recurring aftermarket services. We believe that these complementary product and service offerings have the potential to drive customer retention and recurring revenue. Such offerings are expected to facilitate the transition to electric fleets and vehicle sales to customers who otherwise may not have considered battery-electric fleets. As a result of the foregoing, we believe that we are positioned to become the market leader in the rapidly growing medium- and heavy-duty last mile commercial vehicle market segment through our purpose-built technology, first-mover advantage and our comprehensive Fleet-as-a-Service package.
Our Competitive Advantages
Prior to starting Xos, our co-founders operated a fleet of commercial vehicles and experienced common challenges in commercial fleet management. Such challenges include rising maintenance expenses, volatile fueling costs and evolving emission regulations. Direct experience as fleet operators enabled our founders to develop a customer-focused company with proprietary technology tailored for commercial fleet applications. Our fleet-focused business is further bolstered by customer feedback and on-the-road validation. We delivered our first fleet vehicle in 2018 and have had production vehicles operating on ordinary business routes with industry-leading commercial fleets such as Loomis.
Commercial fleets require attributes that are distinct from passenger cars and light-duty vehicles. Rather than maximizing range and battery volumetric density, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles in the last-mile sector focus on improved gravimetric density to maximize carrying capacity, increased durability to withstand high-impact driving over long periods and low total cost of ownership to maximize profitability. We believe we are a leader in advanced mobility solutions for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles due in part to the following strengths:
•Proprietary X-Pack battery technology design is modular with commercial grade uptime performance and limited system warranty exposure. Our proprietary modular battery systems are purpose-built for the rigors of the commercial last-mile segment. Each X-Pack features its own battery management system (“BMS”) and operates at system voltage which allows each pack to perform independently and irrespective of other packs on the vehicle. This ensures maximum uptime and limited warranty exposure as defects are localized and isolated from the rest of the vehicle and can be addressed at the pack-level (as opposed to requiring a complete system overhaul). This modularity also provides “cut-to-length” capabilities that allow vehicles to be configured and reconfigured post-delivery with the appropriate amount of range and payload capacity with the simple addition and removal of battery packs. Each Xos vehicle can support multiple X-Packs in single-pack increments to tailor battery needs to each user’s unique range and payload requirements, providing maximum operating flexibility for fleet customers.
•Proprietary X-Platform chassis platform adapts to unique specifications and commercial applications. The X-Platform chassis is the foundation of our vehicle products and includes stripped chassis, chassis cab and tractor versions. The X-Platform accommodates a wide range of commercial vehicle bodies, which allows our vehicles to be class, industry and application agnostic. Our universal platform allows us to reduce expenses related to testing, validation and research and development that are normally required to launch new truck variants since our chassis platform is similar across each configuration. Our cross-application approach allows us to offer a wide variety of purpose-built vehicle models, including stepvans, armored stepvans, box trucks, beverage trucks, bucket trucks, and day cabs.
•Expected industry-leading unsubsidized total cost of ownership addresses fleets’ bottom line. Our core technologies, including the X-Pack and the X-Platform, are developed in-house specifically for the last-mile commercial use case and are modular in nature. As a result, we are able to offer fleets expected industry-leading unsubsidized total cost of ownership relative to traditional diesel, hybrid and zero-emissions alternatives. Our vehicles generally price at a slight premium relative to traditional diesel and hybrid alternatives; however, Xos vehicles feature expected payback periods of less than three years and less than one year in certain use cases. Furthermore, our vehicles are generally priced lower than zero-emission competitors. Although our vehicles often qualify for incentives from government-sponsored sustainable energy programs, the aforementioned projected total cost of ownership figures are calculated on an unsubsidized basis and reflect our ability to maintain a long-term competitive edge.
•Investment in customer validation and durability testing leads to first-mover advantage. Customer validation and durability testing is essential for electric vehicle manufacturers to participate in the procurement of the world’s largest fleets and can often take over three years. We have tested and validated our vehicles with large-scale multinational fleets for over three years. We are one of the few emerging zero-emission truck OEMs that have vehicles on the road and operating on business routes. We understand the importance of this process and partnered with large-scale national customers early in our development. We aim to continue our capture of market share by contracting with large-scale commercial fleets and through direct customer channels.
•Flexible manufacturing strategy leveraging smaller more-nimble facilities. We utilize a flexible manufacturing approach that leverages manufacturing partnerships to develop smaller and adaptable facilities relative to the large-scale greenfield manufacturing plants popular amongst traditional automotive manufacturers. Our Flex facilities utilize the existing assembly facilities and labor force of our manufacturing partners and bypass such capital-intensive processes as we enter new markets. Each of our Flex facilities has capacity to manufacture an estimated 5,000 vehicles per year once fully tooled. Each facility’s smaller footprint and our utilization of existing facilities and labor allows us to establish each Flex facility in under one year. We are able to upstart our facilities in lockstep with our order book and address market demand in real-time ahead of competitors with longer lead-time manufacturing strategies. Our nimble Flex facilities can also be strategically positioned in geographies near customers and suppliers — both domestic and international — and reduce logistics complexity and shipping costs.
•Robust network of strategic partners enables turnkey solutions offering.
•Supply Chain: We partner with globalized and diversified supply chain companies to mitigate the risk of localized and single-source production issues for key components such as battery cells, frame components and axles. Our suppliers include LG Chem (providing battery cells from South Korea), Ashok Leyland (providing stamped commodities from India) and TM4 (providing motors and inverters from Canada), among others. Our products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We are currently securing all raw materials and components that are either available or becoming available in the global supply chain to support our operations. 
•Manufacturing: We have established relationships with global and national commercial vehicle manufacturers that provide facilities and labor to assemble our vehicles. Our partners include Metalsa, a worldwide manufacturer of frame and chassis systems for commercial vehicles headquartered in Monterrey, Mexico, and Fitzgerald, the largest manufacturer of glider kits in the United States and partner to our first Flex facility.
•Vehicle Body: We purchase vehicle bodies, including step-van or “walk-through” bodies, directly from vehicle body outfitters such as Morgan Olson. Such vehicle bodies are designed to fit the specific commercial needs of our customers and are installed directly onto our vehicle platforms at designated body upfit facilities.
•Distributors: We work with industry-leading distribution partners, including Thompson Truck Centers, Yancey Bros. Co., and Murphy-Hoffman Company, each of whom has committed to a long-term distribution relationship with Xos. 
•Financing: We have partnered with DLL, a leading global vendor finance partner with a portfolio exceeding €30 billion in assets, to facilitate our Xos Financial Services program. Customers will be able to finance their vehicles and certain other Fleet-as-a-Service products through a variety of financial products with partners such as DLL to accommodate their own unique capital needs.
•Service and Maintenance: We have partnered with Dickinson Fleet Services, a leading provider of fleet maintenance solutions, to provide customers with comprehensive maintenance and after-sales services to ensure maximum uptime and minimal operational disruption. In addition, we partner with our distributor partners for services in their coverage areas.
•Competitive financing options: Through our financing partners, we offer competitive financing solutions across a wide variety of products to offset our customers’ burden of purchasing vehicles outright and to realize certain cost savings. Financial products offered through our financial partners extend beyond vehicle purchases and support our Fleet-as-a-Service products. Customers are able to access financial tools for charging infrastructure, telematics products and vehicle service and maintenance in a bundled contract at a fixed monthly cost. All financing products are underwritten and supplied by our financing partners.
•Comprehensive Fleet-as-a-Service drives customer traction and retention: We manufacture next-generation battery-electric vehicles and provide a comprehensive suite of fleet management products. Our Fleet-as-a-Service program will include products related to charging infrastructure, vehicle service and maintenance, customer financing, telematics services, and risk mitigation products. By providing a bundled all-in-one product suite, we will enable fleets to access a comprehensive set of tools needed to transition to electrification and operate electric vehicles through a single point of contact compared to a traditional model in which such offerings are disaggregated.
•Highly experienced management team complements visionary founders: We have built a world-class team composed of industry leaders with decades of experience from some of the most well-known and highly regarded companies in the advanced mobility and commercial vehicle segments. Such honed experience combined with our founders’ fleet operational professional histories has positioned us to disrupt the incumbent commercial fleet model and capitalize on prime opportunities in the last-mile commercial industry.
Our Go-To-Market Strategy
We delivered our first electric commercial vehicle to a globally recognized commercial fleet in 2018 and have made deliveries to a range of customers. Our vehicles have been used in on-road commercial applications on last-mile routes since 2018. We believe our early commitment to confirmation trials and field use places us ahead of most direct competitors with respect to product validation.
In addition to large-scale national accounts with major commercial fleet operators, we deliver vehicles directly to small and medium fleets via our in-house sales representatives and established distribution and channel partners. Such accounts include independent service providers (ISPs) who fulfill last-mile routes for enterprise partners. Robust partnerships with established distributors such as Thompson Truck Centers, Yancey Bros. Co. and Murphy-Hoffman Company facilitate sales to direct accounts and offer our Fleet-as-a-Service, such as vehicle financing and extended warranty products, to such commercial fleets. 
As of December 31, 2021, we have entered into binding agreements and non-binding letters of intent, memorandums of understanding and other similar agreements with various customers. We have delivered 22 vehicles and 22 powertrains for the year-ended December 31, 2021. Our customer base spans a variety of vocational applications and includes large-scale national accounts (such as AB InBev and Loomis); independent service providers (ISPs) for multinational companies (such as FedEx Ground Operators, BQ Express and Patton Logistics); distribution partners (such as Thompson Truck Centers, Yancey Bros. Co., and Murphy-Hoffman Company); and direct accounts (such as Unifirst).
We believe that our existing contracted customers will continue to procure our vehicles and account for a meaningful portion of projected vehicle deliveries going forward. We are focused on a diversified customer base and are in current discussions with established and well-known fleets across last-mile delivery, business services, drayage and other vocational industries to continue the growth of our customer base.
Our bundled Fleet-as-a-Service under development complements vehicle sales and will drive recurring revenue and customer retention after the initial vehicle sale. Our bundled service offering mitigates barriers to entry for commercial fleet electrification and provides critical infrastructure products, Energy Services, maintenance and service solutions, insurance and warranty packages, financial service options and tailored telematics technologies for purchased and leased vehicles. Our Fleet-as-a-Service allows certain fleet owners to transition to electrification in instances that otherwise would have been cost- or resource-prohibitive.
We aim to leverage opportune sustainability programs in foreign markets to expand our international footprint. We believe our business model enables us to meet international opportunities. Our agile Flex manufacturing strategy facilitates quick adoption in new markets. Our modular X-Platform is broadly adaptable to unique use case specifications in foreign markets. Our global partnership network includes existing footprints in target foreign markets and a multinational blue chip customer portfolio with fleet vehicles operating in international regions. Our expected industry leading unsubsidized total cost of ownership provides low-cost vehicle options even without accounting for region- and country-specific economic incentives. Our honed focus on the last-mile commercial segment further provides a competitive advantage as our products are not dependent on non-existent or underdeveloped long-haul transportation infrastructure in less developed regions.
Our Products and Services
We have been committed to advanced mobility solutions for last-mile commercial fleets and innovative approaches to sustainability since our founding in 2015. Our deep-seated expertise and acute fleet operation experience proved critical in the development of our modular X-Platform and Fleet-as-a-Service bundled product offering.
X-Platform (Class 5/6 and Class 7/8):
Our proprietary X-Platform is the core modular chassis platform for Xos vehicles. Our cross-application platform features broad deployment capabilities and accommodates a wide range of vehicle bodies and use-case applications.

Our Proprietary Technologies
We developed proprietary technologies central to our vehicles and service offerings, including the X-Pack advanced battery pack systems, X-Platform modular vehicle chassis platform, next-generation vehicle software and our Xosphere Intelligence Platform.
X-Pack Battery
We have the ability to design and engineer battery systems internally, as well as the flexibility to integrate battery systems or components from partners. We have developed proprietary battery technology, engineered from the cell-up and purpose-built for the last-mile commercial use case. Our Xos battery packs feature “cut-to-length” modular architecture to provide flexibility and meet each customer’s unique range and payload capacity needs. 
We began the production of the Lyra Series of battery packs to be installed on new Xos vehicles beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Lyra series of battery packs features a 52% improvement in gravimetric energy density and a 45% improvement in volumetric energy density from prior Xos battery systems, and is compatible with all Xos on-highway vehicles. The battery packs come in two configurations: Lyra 30 (29.4kWh) and Lyra 60 (61.8kWh) offering 25 and 50 miles of range, respectively. Each pack features individual, recirculated air cooling and an independent battery management system, offering improved reliability and the ability to mix-and-match packs to cater to each customer’s unique range requirements.
X-Platform Chassis
The X-Platform chassis was built and designed specifically for last-mile commercial use. The X-Platform is the foundation for Xos vehicle products, including our stripped chassis, chassis cab and tractor vehicles. Our modular proprietary chassis accommodates a wide range of commercial use applications and vehicle body upfits. Such modularity provides us with a competitive advantage in the commercial transportation sector in which commercial fleet operators deploy vehicles across an array of use-applications and environments.
Each X-Platform is able to accommodate a sufficient number of X-Packs to provide over 200 miles of range across our current vehicle product variants. Our vehicle range capability allows Xos vehicles to meet the demands of rigorous last-mile routes. Each X-Platform is constructed with high-strength steel and provides enhanced durability relative to other options on the market.
Vehicle Control Software
We designed and developed on-board vehicle control software which leverages basic third-party software and integrates our proprietary powertrain controls, body controls, instrument cluster and infotainment and Xos-Connect software.
•Powertrain controls. We developed our powertrain controls, which include, but are not limited to, torque arbitration and power state management, thermal management for our powertrain and high-voltage battery systems, advanced driver assistance and safety (ADAS) and charging system communication and controls.
•Body controls. We developed our body controls, which include cabin heater and air conditioning, shifter communication, power steering control, electronic parking brake system and certain other software critical to vehicle controls.
•Instrument cluster and infotainment. We designed a fully digital instrument cluster specifically for last-mile commercial electric vehicles. Our custom user interface integrates into all Xos vehicles and is designed to enhance safe vehicle operation and provide critical safety information and driver efficiency guidance.

Our platform is designed to be an all-in-one vehicle control center. The Xosphere Intelligence Platform will provide vehicle telematics data, such as real-time location, driver performance, vehicle alerts, dashcam integration, battery capacity, energy consumption, fuel cost savings and environmental impact.
In addition to vehicle performance, the Xosphere Intelligence Platform will integrate with third-party systems for service and maintenance, financing, and certain other commercial vehicle applications, providing fleet operators with comprehensive data and analysis to increase operational efficiencies and reduce operating costs.
Flex Manufacturing
We have taken a conservative approach to capital investment with our Flex manufacturing strategy. 
Our agile Flex manufacturing strategy leverages existing facilities and labor talent through strategic manufacturing partnerships. Such approach allows us to assemble vehicles in a more time- and capital-efficient manner relative to traditional, large-scale automotive assembly factories. Each Xos Flex facility is designed to produce up to 5,000 vehicles per year once fully tooled. Our facilities will host their own co-located battery and vehicle assembly lines and assemble fully operational vehicles to be directly delivered to customers or final body upfitters. Our Flex manufacturing approach is structured such that manufacturing partners provide real property facilities and vehicle assembly services while we coordinate other aspects of the manufacturing process, including supply chain logistics, battery assembly and manufacturing engineering.
Each of our Flex manufacturing facilities will require an estimated $45 million in capital expenditure — approximately 80% less than a traditional large-scale automotive manufacturing facility. Our Flex facilities are operational as quickly as within one year, an estimated two to three years quicker than construction and completion of traditional greenfield automotive factories. Furthermore, our factory management system and line design require a real estate footprint as small as 150,000 square feet — a footprint more than approximately 90% smaller than traditional automotive assembly facilities.
Our strategic approach to agile manufacturing facilities and shortened production timelines allow us to meet demand in real-time and more quickly than competitors. Our nimble facilities also allow us to establish production facilities in close proximity to customers and body upfitters, which in turn reduces delivery logistics and shipping expenses. 
Due to the X-Platform proprietary design, our assembly lines require no on-site stamping or certain other processes and equipment that typically drive up the cost of traditional automotive assembly. Each assembly line can also accommodate various Xos vehicle products as opposed to being limited and designed for single product use.
As of December 31, 2021, we have two Flex facilities operating and producing our vehicles. Our first facility was launched in partnership with Fitzgerald, the largest manufacturer of glider vehicles in the United States, which at one point produced over 5,000 tractor trucks per year. The facility is strategically located in Byrdstown, Tennessee near Morgan Olson, a provider of stepvan vehicle bodies for over 100 years and the preferred provider of a number of our customers. We also assemble vehicles with Metalsa, a global manufacturer of frame and chassis systems for commercial vehicles headquartered in Monterrey, Mexico. Metalsa features facilities across the globe with capacity to manufacture vehicles in our target international markets.
Our Growth Strategy
We intend to leverage our competitive advantages and the following growth strategies to remain a leader in intelligent mobility solutions:
•Capitalize on increasing regulatory pressure and customer demand for zero-emission vehicles. Commercial trucks in the United States emit as much GHG as passenger cars, producing over 750 million tons of GHG in the United States annually, despite traveling 45% fewer miles than passenger cars. U.S. federal, state and local regulations have required transitions to clean transportation solutions. In addition, approximately 20 countries have committed to the reduction of phase fossil fuel use in vehicles by 2040. We are prepared to capitalize on such regulatory tailwinds globally.
•Focus on land-and-expand strategy. We have built strong customer relationships. All customers with Xos vehicles in their fleets for over one year have committed to binding or non-binding follow-on orders underscoring the efficacy of our next-generation vehicle technologies. We continue to develop long-term relationships with our established customer base and anticipate higher volume vehicles orders as each transitions to net-carbon neutral fleet programs.
•Acquisition of new customers. By leveraging existing strategic partnerships, including Thompson Truck Centers, Yancey Bros. Co., and Murphy-Hoffman Company, we expect to broaden our customer base and expand into new markets. We expect to capture new fleet customers through our attractive value propositions, advanced vehicle technologies and bundled Fleet-as-a-Service package.
•International expansion. We have the ability to expand internationally in a capital efficient manner due in part to the modularity of our broad X-Platform and X-Pack battery system applications and agile Flex manufacturing approach. We are currently in discussions with numerous fleets in Canada, Europe and South America. We also intend to leverage the international footprint of our existing global customers to cross-sell to foreign markets.
•Opportunistic strategic acquisitions. We may pursue strategic acquisitions to accelerate our growth plans and supplement our existing product and service offerings.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to protect our material intellectual property is important to our business. We rely upon a combination of protections afforded to owners of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks, along with employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, unpatented trade secrets in the fields of research, development and engineering are an important aspect of our business by ensuring that our technology remains confidential. We also pursue patent protection when we believe we have developed a patentable invention and the benefits of obtaining a patent outweigh the risks of making the invention public through patent filings.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 5 awarded U.S. patents. We pursue the registration of our domain names and material trademarks and service marks in the United States. In an effort to protect our brand, as of December 31, 2021, we had 22 pending or approved U.S. trademark applications.
We regularly review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new inventions, and we are prepared to file additional patent applications when we determine it would benefit our business to do so.
Facilities 
Our headquarters are located in an 85,142 square foot facility in Los Angeles, California, where we design, engineer and develop our vehicles and battery packs. We entered a new lease agreement for the facility with the landlord in August 2021. The new lease commenced on January 1, 2022 and will terminate pursuant to its terms on January 31, 2027, unless amended and/or extended.
In addition to our headquarter location, we have short-term leases in North Hollywood, California and Beaverton, Oregon to support our operations. 
Human Capital
People Strategy and Governance
We firmly believe an integral part of our growth story is through elevating the most important asset we have: our people. By focusing on the fundamentals of our people strategy, leadership, culture and talent, we remain strong, adaptive, innovative, and well-equipped to respond to the ever-changing commercial vehicle landscape. Our Employee Experience Team and Sustainability and Innovation Committee are and will be responsible for our human capital policies and strategies and their collective recommendations to our CEO and key leadership members allow us to proactively manage our human capital and care for our employees in a manner that is consistent with our values.
Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
At Xos, we believe that creating an inclusive environment for all our employees is foundational to our success and, more importantly, morally the right thing to do. One of our organizational values is “One team: Be actively inclusive. Embrace diversity. Support and celebrate others.” We are committed to creating and maintaining a workplace in which all employees have an opportunity to participate and contribute to the success of our business and are valued for their skills, experience, and unique perspectives. 
We administer Employee Resource Groups that represent various dimensions of our employee population, including racial, ethnic, gender, religious, and generational communities, as well as provide training materials to team leaders on inclusive leadership. These groups provide a place for employees of diverse backgrounds to find belonging at Xos in addition to helping all employees learn about experiences that differ from their own.
Talent Attraction, Growth, and Capability Assessment
We leverage best practices in assessments and talent management to strengthen and expand our current capabilities and future pipeline while reinforcing a culture of belonging, empowerment, and innovation. We also create targeted learning experiences, democratizing learning and career development opportunities across the organization, and empowering employees to design their own career paths with skill development targeted for the roles of today and the future.
The extent to which our leaders are equipped to care for, inspire, and empower our people plays a vital role in our strategy. Our set of leadership habits outlines clear expectations for our leaders: that they regularly connect with team members, spend time teaching and coaching, and champion their team’s career development. We are committed to helping our leaders strengthen these capabilities with dedicated learning paths and non-traditional learning opportunities.
Employee Well-being Initiatives
Our holistic approach to well-being encompasses the financial, social, mental/emotional, physical, and professional needs of our employees. Foundational to our well-being philosophy is providing a broad array of resources and solutions to educate employees and build capability and support for meeting individual well-being needs and goals. These initiatives include financial seminars, weekly mindfulness sessions, an on-site gym, and healthy food in our kitchens.
We employ programs to understand employee sentiment on their mental and emotional well-being, health & safety, employee experience, culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, leadership and strategic alignment. Weekly check-ins gather pulse scores and employee feedback on those topics. Suggestion boxes and focus groups collect additional information on employee sentiment and needs, and we communicate the resulting actions taken with our employee population. 
Our well-being programs are an integral part of our total rewards strategy as we work to address business and employee challenges through a multi-channel approach that provides our diverse populations and global regions flexibility and choices to meet their specific needs.
Employment Data
As of December 31, 2021, we had 289 full-time employees, 35 contractors and 5 interns. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.
Government Regulations
We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The laws and regulations to which we are subject govern, among others, vehicle emissions and the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of environmental contamination. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial and local level is an important aspect of our ability to continue our operations.
Environmental standards applicable to us are established by the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and the permits and licenses issued to us. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and what we anticipate will be increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial administrative, civil or even criminal fines, penalties, and possibly orders to cease any violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits or licenses.
Emissions
California has greenhouse gas emissions standards that closely follow the standards of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The registration and sale of ZEVs in California could earn us ZEV credits that we could in turn sell to traditional original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) looking to offset emissions from their traditional internal combustion engine vehicles in order to meet California’s emissions regulations. Other U.S. states have adopted similar standards including Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. We may take advantage of these regimes by registering and selling ZEVs in these other U.S. states.
ZEV credits in California are calculated under the ZEV regulation and are paid in relation to ZEVs sold and registered in California including battery electric vehicles (“BEVs”) and fuel cell electric vehicles (“FCEVs”). The ZEV program assigns ZEV credits to each vehicle manufacturer. Vehicle manufacturers are required to maintain ZEV credits equal to a set percentage of non-electric vehicles sold and registered in California. Each vehicle sold and registered in California earns a number of credits based on the drivetrain type and the all-electric range (“AER”) of the vehicle under the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule Test Cycle. 
EPA Emissions and Certificate of Conformity
The U.S. Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) certifying that its vehicles comply with all applicable emissions requirements. A Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards or a CARB Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have adopted California’s stricter standards for emissions controls related to new vehicles and engines sold in such states. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the CARB Executive Order for sales of vehicles. In addition to California, there are 13 other states which have either adopted or are in the process of adopting the stricter California standards, including New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Washington, Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and Colorado.
Although our vehicles have zero-emissions, we are required to seek an EPA Certificate of Conformity for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards or a CARB Executive Order for vehicles sold in California or any of the other 13 states identified above that have adopted the stricter California standards.
Vehicle Safety and Testing
Our vehicles are subject to, and are required to comply with, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, as amended, and numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), an operating administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation, including applicable U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards (“FMVSS”). We expect our vehicles to either meet or otherwise be exempt from all applicable FMVSS. Additionally, there are regulatory changes being considered for several FMVSSs, and while we anticipate being in compliance with the proposed changes, there is no assurance until final regulation changes are enacted.
As a U.S.-based manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSSs, as well as the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the United States. Numerous FMVSSs apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness requirements, crash avoidance requirements and EV-specific requirements. We will also be required to comply with other federal laws and regulations administered by NHTSA.
As we expand our offerings outside of the United States, our vehicles will be subject to foreign safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the United States and may require redesign and/or retesting. 
Battery Safety and Testing Regulation
Our battery packs are required to conform to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. The governing regulations, which are issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations and related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. The regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation, such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck or air. We use lithium-ion cells in the high voltage battery packs in our vehicles. The use, storage, and disposal of our battery packs is regulated under U.S. federal law.
Competition
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition from a number of companies, particularly as the commercial transportation sector increasingly shifts towards low-emission, zero-emission or carbon neutral solutions. Existing commercial diesel vehicle OEMs, such as Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Navistar, Paccar, Shyft Group, and Volvo, maintain the largest market shares in the sector. 
In addition to competition from traditional diesel OEMs, we face competition from disruptive vehicle manufacturers that are developing alternative fuel and electric commercial vehicles, such as Nikola, Arrival, Rivian, Workhorse, BYD Motors, The Lion Electric Company, and Proterra.
We take a hybrid approach to the development of customers based on the size of their fleets. Our client base includes small (<20 vehicles), medium- (20-100 vehicles), and large (>100 vehicles) fleet owners and operators. Many large fleets have clearly defined fleet procurement divisions, which allows us to more easily identify decision-makers using a smaller sales force. Implementation of our vehicles into large national fleets also validates our vehicle products for small and medium fleet operators. However, large national fleets tend to have long sales cycles and pursue a phased approach to new vehicle implementation. Most sizeable fleet operators are in the early stages of adoption of commercial electric vehicle solutions. One approach taken by such fleets, including operators who have publicly announced their intention to electrify their fleets, is to test multiple commercial electric vehicle alternatives. In such a competitive landscape, we believe our proven advantages, including our industry-leading total cost of ownership, will enable our vehicles to out-compete other electric vehicles in such trials.
Small and medium fleets often have more streamlined fleet purchase processes than large fleet operators and fewer requests for tailor-made product specifications. We are often able to more quickly engage and complete vehicle sales cycles with such clients. Many small and medium fleets have different vehicle use cases than large fleets, and such companies provide us valuable feedback for product development purposes.
We believe the primary competitive factors in the commercial vehicle market for medium- and heavy-duty last-mile and return-to-base segments include, but are not limited to:
•total cost of ownership;
•emissions profile;
•effectiveness within target applications and use cases;
•ease of integration into existing operations;
•product performance and uptime;
•vehicle quality, reliability and safety;
•vehicle service and support;
•technological innovation specifically around battery, software and data analytics; and
•fleet management
We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors; however, most of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than us. Our competitors may be able to deploy greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sales, marketing and support of their alternative fuel and electric vehicle programs. Additionally, some of our competitors also have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger sales forces, broader customer and industry relationships and other greater tangible and intangible resources than us. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified research and development, sales, marketing and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our products. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
