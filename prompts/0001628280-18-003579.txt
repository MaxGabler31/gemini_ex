Overview
We empower innovators to build a better world with data. As the demand for data and the need for real-time analytics increase, we are focused on delivering software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers, enabling customers to maximize the value of data, gain competitive advantage and keep pace with cutting edge developments. Our innovative data platform replaces storage systems designed for mechanical disk with all-flash systems optimized end-to-end for solid-state memory. Our Pure1 cloud-based support and management platform, powered by our META AI Engine dramatically simplifies storage administration, while real-time scanning enables us to find and fix issues before they have an impact. Our innovative business model replaces the traditional forklift upgrade cycle with an Evergreen Storage model of hardware and software innovation, support and maintenance.
We were incorporated in October 2009 and are headquartered in Mountain View, California, with operations throughout the world. Our primary offerings include our FlashArray and FlashBlade products, inclusive of our Purity Operating Environment (Purity OE) software, our Pure1 cloud-based management and support software, and FlashStack, our joint converged infrastructure solution with Cisco. We have experienced substantial growth over the past three years; our revenue was $440.3 million, $728.0 million, and $1,023.0 million for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. As of January 31, 2018, we had over 2,100 employees globally. 
Since launching in May 2012, our customer base has grown to over 4,500 customers, including over 30% of the Fortune 500. Our customers include large and mid-size organizations across a diverse set of industry verticals, including cloud-based software and service providers, consumer web, education, energy, financial services, governments, healthcare, manufacturing, media, retail and telecommunications. Our data platform is used for a broad set of use cases, including database applications, large-scale analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, private and public cloud infrastructure and webscale applications, virtual server infrastructure and virtual desktop infrastructure. Our data platform helps customers scale their businesses through real-time and more accurate analytics, increase employee productivity, improve operational efficiency, and deliver more compelling user experiences to their customers and partners.
We sell our data platform predominantly through a high touch, channel-fulfilled model. Our sales force works collaboratively with our global network of distribution and channel partners, which provides us broad sales reach while maintaining direct customer engagement.
Recent Developments
In April 2017, we announced FlashArray//X, our first all-NVMe, enterprise-class all-flash array, which utilizes our innovative DirectFlash technologies to interface our software directly with raw flash. FlashArray//X became generally available later in the year.
In June 2017, we announced Purity ActiveCluster, a true active/active metro stretch cluster solution, as well as various new software features including Policy QoS and VVols, and a series of updates to FlashBlade, including an ultra-fast, all-flash S3 object store and a 17TB blade, which became generally available later in the year. We also announced Pure1 META, the artificial intelligence engine within our platform for delivering on the vision of self-driving storage.
In August 2017, we announced that Charles Giancarlo was appointed as our new chief executive officer. 
Innovative Technology and Business Model
We deliver our data platform via our flash-optimized software, Purity OE, modular and scalable all-flash hardware platforms, FlashArray and FlashBlade, as well as our Pure1 cloud-based management and support platform. We also offer a converged infrastructure solution, FlashStack, jointly with our partner Cisco. Our entire data platform is powered by innovative software that is cloud-connected for management from anywhere and supported by our Evergreen Storage business model. Similar to what customers expect from the public cloud, with Pure1 and Evergreen Storage, our customers benefit from near zero administration and a subscription to the latest technology, but with much higher performance and lower cost.

Software Optimized for Solid-State Memory
The heart of our data platform is our proprietary Purity OE software that implements enterprise-class storage services such as data reduction, encryption and data protection, as well as protocol services such as block, file and object. Variants of Purity OE have been optimized for both our FlashArray and FlashBlade platforms. Our Purity OE software employs variable block size data reduction algorithms and can deliver up to two to five times better data reduction as compared to leading competitive products, resulting in an average of 5-to-1 data reduction across a wide range of use cases and data types. Our software implements strong data-at-rest encryption of all data, all the time, and is designed to maintain performance through failures and enables our arrays to be easily upgraded without scheduled downtime, setting new expectations for storage resiliency. With our DirectFlash architecture, recent versions of Purity OE have been optimized to speak directly to raw NAND Flash, enabling us to overcome the inefficiencies of prior commodity SSD architectures.
Hardware Optimized for Solid-State Memory
The hardware underlying our FlashArray and FlashBlade products is designed to maximize the performance and density of flash, optimize our advanced software services, and minimize overall solution cost for customers. Our platforms are designed to be modular and upgradable over time, enabling our vision of Evergreen Storage and eliminating the 3 to 5 year forklift refresh cycle of legacy storage systems. Our platform's design allows us to periodically deliver both processor and flash upgrades, and enables customers to adopt these advances without data migration, downtime or performance impact. This also enables a business model of ongoing up-sell to enable customers to easily expand capacity and performance as their data needs grow.
Our platforms are designed to maximize the performance of flash, leveraging native high bandwidth and low latency PCIe/NVMe networking and to be extremely simple and reliable without sacrificing the scalability and upgradability of an enterprise array. Because we design both our FlashArray and FlashBlade products in-house, and develop all of our Purity OE software specifically for our hardware, we are able to realize end-to-end optimizations between software and flash storage, such as true global flash management with DirectFlash software and FlashArray//X's end-to-end NVMe optimization. This allows us to deliver solutions with high density, power efficiency and tight integration for simplicity, all at a lower cost.
Pure1 Management, Support and Analytics
Pure1 is a cloud-based management and support offering that enables our customers, our support staff and our partners to seamlessly and securely collaborate to maximize the reliability of the Pure Storage platform while minimizing management overhead and cost to the customer. This cloud-based platform removes the need for dedicated storage management infrastructure, enables customers to monitor a global storage deployment from a mobile device and simplifies integration with other data center management solutions. Pure1's Global Insight technology also employs cutting-edge real-time analytics and machine learning technologies to predictively identify potential issues with our platform, enabling our support organization to proactively resolve support incidents before they start - leading to higher uptime and availability for our data platform, and features powered by Pure1 META enable customers to predict both capacity and performance and get intelligent advice on workload deployment, interaction and optimization.
Innovative Business Model
In addition to our product leadership and differentiated customer experience, our innovative business model helps us achieve our vision of Evergreen Storage. We believe that the traditional storage business model is expensive, resource intensive and detrimentally impacts customer operations. Our alternative approach is designed to eliminate this pain. We offer a simple all-inclusive software model and a new approach to the storage array purchase and expansion lifecycle, allowing customers to incrementally improve array performance and capacity as needed, dramatically reducing cost and risk, while increasing predictability. This enables customers to both extend the useful life of their hardware and avoid the cost and risk of recurring data migration. We believe that it will be difficult for legacy storage vendors to entirely copy our business-model innovations given their disk-based product architectures, the inflexibility of hardware upgrades to their platforms, and dependence on complex licensing programs and regular forklift array replacement upgrades.

Our Customers
We target a variety of large and mid-size commercial enterprises, federal, state, and local governments, schools and healthcare organizations globally. Our customer base includes over 4,500 organizations as of January 31, 2018, including over 30% of the Fortune 500. We have deployed our platform at customers across multiple industry verticals. Our platform has been deployed in some of the largest and most sophisticated enterprises in the world as well as smaller organizations with limited IT expertise or budget, including hospitals, municipalities and school districts. Hundreds of our customers have invested north of a million dollars in leveraging our platform across their business-critical applications. We define a customer as an end user that purchases our products and services either from one of our channel partners or from us directly. No end customer represented more than 10% of our revenue for the year ended January 31, 2018.
Sales and Marketing
Sales. We sell our storage platform predominantly through a high touch, channel-fulfilled sales model. Our sales organization supports our channel partners and is responsible for large-account penetration, global account coordination and overall market development. Our channel partners help market and sell our products, typically with assistance from our sales force. This joint sales approach provides us with the benefit of direct relationships with our customers and expands our reach through the relationships of our channel partners. In certain geographies we sell through a two-tier distribution model. We also sell to service providers that deploy our products and offer cloud-based storage services to their customers. No channel partner represented 10% of our revenue for the year ended January 31, 2018.
We intend to continue to expand our partner relationships to further extend our sales coverage and to invest in education, training and programs to increase the ability of our channel partners to sell our products independently. We expect to continue to grow our sales organization and expand our international sales presence. Generally, our sales representatives have become more productive the longer they are with us, with limited productivity in their first few quarters as they learn to sell our products, participate in classroom and field training and build a customer base. We optimize our sales management efforts to help our sales representatives maximize their productivity throughout their tenure. Our sales organization is supported by sales engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for pre-sales technical support, solutions engineering and technical training. 
Technology Alliances. We work closely with technology partners that help us deliver world-class solutions to our customers and ensure the efficient deployment and support of their data center infrastructure. Our technology partners include application partners such as Microsoft, Oracle and SAP and infrastructure partners such as Arista, Brocade, Catalogic, Cisco, Citrix, Cohesity, CommVault, Nvidia, RedHat, Rubrik, Symantec, Veeam and VMware. In addition, we work closely with our technology partners through co-marketing and lead-generation activities in an effort to broaden our marketing reach and help us win new customers and retain existing ones.
Marketing. Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation and market awareness, communicating product advantages, driving customer demand and generating leads for our sales force and channel partners. Our marketing effort consists primarily of product, field, channel, solutions and digital marketing and public relations.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on improving our existing products and developing new products. Our products integrate both software and hardware innovations, and accordingly, our research and development teams employ both software and hardware engineers in the design, development, testing, certification and support of our products. The majority of our research and development team is based in Mountain View, California. We also design, test and certify our products to ensure interoperability with a variety of third-party software, servers, operating systems and network components. We plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to our ongoing research and development efforts.
Research and development expenses were $166.6 million, $245.8 million and $279.2 million for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.
Manufacturing
Our primary contract manufacturer, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., known as Foxconn, manufactures, assembles, tests and packages our products in accordance with our specifications. Our contract manufacturers

generally procure the hardware components for final assembly of our products. Most of the components are purchased from sources that we believe are readily available from other suppliers.
We provide our contract manufacturers a rolling forecast for anticipated orders, which our contract manufacturers use to build finished products. The product mix and volumes are adjusted based on anticipated demand and actual sales and shipments in prior periods. Our contract manufacturers are generally able to respond to changes in our product mix or volume without significant delay or increased costs. Our agreement with Foxconn has a three-year term that is subject to optional extensions absent notice of termination by either party. This agreement is terminable at any time by either party with 180-days’ prior notice. Our agreement with our contract manufacturers do not provide for any specific volume purchase commitments and orders are placed on a purchase order basis. We work closely with our contract manufacturers to meet our product delivery requirements and to manage the manufacturing process and quality control.
Backlog
We typically accept and ship orders within a short time frame. In general, customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty, and delivery schedules requested by customers in their purchase orders vary based upon each customer’s particular needs. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is a reliable indicator of future revenue.
Seasonality
We generally experience the lowest demand for our products and services in the first quarter of our fiscal year and the greatest demand for our products and services in the last quarter of our fiscal year, which is consistent with the seasonality of the enterprise storage/IT industry as a whole.
Competition
We operate in the intensely competitive data storage market that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in the application requirements, data center infrastructure trends and the broader technology landscape, result in evolving customer requirements for capacity, performance scalability and enterprise features of storage systems. Our main competitors include large vendors such as Dell EMC, Hitachi Vantara, HP Enterprise, IBM, Lenovo, and NetApp that offer a broad range of systems targeting various use cases and end markets and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive products to market.
In addition, we compete against some cloud providers and vendors of hyper-converged products. Some large-scale cloud providers, known for developing storage systems internally, are expanding quickly and offer alternatives to our products for a variety of customer workloads. Our market attracts new startups and more highly specialized vendors, as well as larger vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their products more effectively. The acquisitions of EMC by Dell, Nimble Storage by HP Enterprise and SolidFire by NetApp have introduced new competitive dynamics into the storage market. All of our competitors utilize a broad range of competitive strategies.
We believe the principal competitive factors in the storage market are as follows:

• | Product features and enhancements, including ease of use, performance, reliability and scalability;


• | Product pricing and total cost of ownership;


• | Product interoperability with customer networks and backup software;


• | Global sales and distribution capability;


• | Ability to take advantage of improvements in industry standard components; and


• | Customer support and service.

We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of our hardware and software, product capabilities, ability to deliver the benefits of all-flash storage to a broad set of customers, management simplicity, ease of use and differentiated customer support. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
