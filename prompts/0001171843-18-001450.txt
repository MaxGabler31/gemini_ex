ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a global, integrated orthopedic medicines company committed to improving the lives of patients with degenerative orthopedic diseases and traumatic conditions with clinically meaningful therapies along the continuum of care, from palliative pain management to regenerative tissue repair. We have over two decades of global expertise developing, manufacturing, and commercializing products based on our proprietary hyaluronic acid (“HA”) technology. Our orthopedic medicine portfolio includes ORTHOVISC, MONOVISC, and CINGAL, which alleviate pain and restore joint function by replenishing depleted HA, and HYALOFAST, a solid HA-based scaffold to aid cartilage repair and regeneration.
 
Our therapeutic offerings consist of products in the following areas: Orthobiologics, Dermal, Surgical, and Other, which includes our ophthalmic and veterinary products. All of our products are based on HA, a naturally occurring, biocompatible polymer found throughout the body. Due to its unique biophysical and biochemical properties, HA plays an important role in a number of physiological functions such as the protection and lubrication of soft tissues and joints, the maintenance of the structural integrity of tissues, and the transport of molecules to and within cells.
 
Our proprietary technologies for modifying the HA molecule allow product properties to be tailored specifically to therapeutic use. Our patented technology chemically modifies HA to allow for longer residence time in the body. We also offer products made from HA based on two other technologies: HYAFF, which is a solid form of HA, and ACP gel, an autocross-linked polymer of HA. Our technologies are protected by an extensive portfolio of owned and licensed patents.
 
Since our inception as a Massachusetts corporation in 1992, we have utilized a commercial partnership model for the distribution of our products to end users. Our strong, worldwide network of distributors has historically provided, and continues to provide, a solid foundation for our revenue growth and territorial expansion. In 2015, we made the strategic decision to commercialize our next generation viscosupplementation product, CINGAL, in the United States by utilizing a direct sales model, initially through the engagement of a contract sales organization. Ultimately, we intend to transition the direct sales function into our company as part of a broader buildout of our commercial capabilities. We believe that the combination of the direct and distribution commercial models will maximize the revenue and profitability potential from our current and future product portfolio.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed all planned activities related to the strategic project we began in 2015 to insource the manufacturing of our HYAFF-based products to our Bedford, Massachusetts global headquarters facility. Final costs totaled $23.0 million for this project. These products were previously manufactured by a third-party contract manufacturer in Italy. Our main purposes behind this strategic initiative are to enhance our research and development capabilities with the aim of accelerating future product development and to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes.
 
The following sections provide more specific information about our products and related activities:
 
Orthobiologics
 
Our Orthobiologics products primarily consist of viscosupplementation and regenerative orthopedic products. These products are used in a wide range of treatments, from providing pain relief from osteoarthritis to regenerating damaged tissue such as cartilage. Osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease causing pain, swelling, and restricted movement in joints. It occurs when the cartilage in a joint gradually deteriorates due to the effects of mechanical stress, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including the normal aging process. In an osteoarthritic joint, particular regions of articulating surfaces are exposed to irregular forces, which results in the remodeling of tissue surfaces that disrupt the normal equilibrium or mechanical function. As osteoarthritis advances, the joint gradually loses its ability to regenerate cartilage tissue, and the cartilage layer attached to the bone eventually deteriorates to the point that the bone becomes exposed. Advanced osteoarthritis often requires surgery and the possible implantation of artificial joints. The current treatment options for osteoarthritis, prior to joint replacement surgery, include viscosupplementation, analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroid injections.

Our viscosupplementation franchise includes ORTHOVISC, ORTHOVISC mini, MONOVISC, and CINGAL. ORTHOVISC is available in the United States, Canada, and other international markets for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, and in Europe and certain international markets for the treatment of osteoarthritis in all synovial joints. ORTHOVISC mini is available in Europe, and it is designed for the treatment of osteoarthritis in small joints. MONOVISC is our single injection osteoarthritis treatment indicated for all synovial joints in Europe and certain international markets, including India and Australia, and for the knee in the United States, Turkey, and Canada. ORTHOVISC has been marketed by us internationally since 1996, and it was approved by the FDA for sale in the United States in 2004. ORTHOVISC mini and MONOVISC became available in certain international markets in the second quarter of 2008. MONOVISC was approved by the FDA for sale in the United States in February 2014, and the related U.S. commercial introduction of the product occurred in April 2014. In the United States, our viscosupplementation franchise, consisting of our ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC products, continues to maintain a market leadership position. CINGAL, our second single-injection osteoarthritis product, received regulatory approval from Health Canada in November 2015 for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee. In March 2016, we received CE Mark approval of CINGAL as a viscoelastic supplement or as a replacement for synovial fluid in human joints. We successfully achieved commercial launch of the product in Canada during May 2016 and in the European Union during June 2016. CINGAL is also distributed in certain countries in Asia. Upon achievement, if any, of regulatory approval in the United States, we plan to commercialize the product through a direct sales model, initially through the engagement of a contract sales organization, with the ultimate goal of transitioning the direct sales function into our company as part of a broader buildout of our commercial capabilities. For additional information about CINGAL in the United States, see the section captioned “Business—Research and Development of Potential Products.”
 
In the United States, ORTHOVISC is indicated for the treatment of pain caused by osteoarthritis of the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative, non-pharmacologic therapy and to simple analgesics, such as acetaminophen. ORTHOVISC is a sterile, clear, viscous solution of hyaluronan dissolved in physiological saline and dispensed in a single-use syringe. A complex sugar of the glycosaminoglycan family, hyaluronan is a high-molecular-weight polysaccharide composed of repeating disaccharide units of sodium glucuronate and N-acetyl glucosamine. ORTHOVISC is injected into joints in a series of three intra-articular injections one week apart. ORTHOVISC became available for sale in the United States on March 1, 2004, and it is marketed by DePuy Synthes Mitek Sports Medicine, a division of DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (“Mitek”) under the terms of an initial ten-year licensing, distribution, supply, and marketing agreement which was entered into in December 2003 (the “Mitek ORTHOVISC Agreement”). The Mitek ORTHOVISC Agreement has been extended for two additional five-year terms, and it will now expire on December 20, 2023, unless it is further extended by Mitek. Outside of the U.S., we have a number of distribution relationships servicing international markets including Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. We will continue to seek to establish distribution relationships in other key markets. See the sections captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Overview” and “Risk Factors.”
 
In the United States, MONOVISC is also indicated for the treatment of pain caused by osteoarthritis of the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative, non-pharmacologic therapy and to simple analgesics, such as acetaminophen. MONOVISC is a sterile, clear, viscous solution of partially cross-linked sodium hyaluronate in a phosphate buffered saline solution. A treatment of MONOVISC is comprised of one injection of the product delivered directly into the affected joint. MONOVISC became available for sale in the United States in April 2014, and it is also marketed by Mitek under the terms of a fifteen-year licensing, distribution, supply, and marketing agreement, which was entered into on December 21, 2011 (the “Mitek MONOVISC Agreement”). Outside of the United States, we have a number of distribution relationships servicing international markets including Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, Asia, Australia, and certain other international countries. We continue to seek to establish distribution relationships in other key markets. See the sections captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Overview” and “Risk Factors.”

In addition to the four viscosupplementation products discussed above, we also offer several additional products used in connection with orthopedic regenerative medicine. These products are based on the HYAFF technology and are currently available in Europe, South America, Asia, and certain other international markets. They include HYALOFAST, a biodegradable support for human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells used for cartilage regeneration and as an adjunct for microfracture surgery; HYALONECT, a resorbable knitted fabric mesh for use in orthopedic and trauma reconstructive procedures to maintain the relative position of engrafted bone tissue or bone fragments from comminuted fractures; and HYALOSS MATRIX, HYAFF fibers used to mix blood/bone grafts to form a paste for bone regeneration. We also offer HYALOGLIDE, an ACP gel used in tenolysis treatment, with the potential for use in flexor tendon adhesion prevention and for use in the shoulder for prevention of adhesive capsulitis with additional clinical data. This product is commercialized through a network of distributors, primarily in Europe and the Middle East. We also received CE Mark approval in December 2016 for a product which utilizes our proprietary HA technology to treat pain associated with lateral epicondylitis, better known as tennis elbow. Outside of the United States, this product is marketed under the trade name ORTHOVISC-T. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2016, we submitted an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) to the FDA to conduct a Phase III clinical trial for this treatment, and the IDE was approved by the FDA in June 2016. In addition to these products, we also received 510(k) clearance for an injectable HA-based bone repair treatment in December 2017. In total, Orthobiologics products accounted for 87%, 87%, and 84% of our product revenue in 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively. 
 
Dermal
 
Our dermal products consist of advanced wound care products, based on the HYAFF technology, and an aesthetic dermal filler, based on our proprietary chemically modified, cross-linked HA technology. Products utilizing our HYAFF technology are used for the treatment of skin wounds, ranging from burns to diabetic ulcers. The products cover a variety of wound treatment solutions including debridement agents, advanced therapies to aid healing, and scaffolds used as skin substitutes. Leading products include HYALOMATRIX and HYALOFILL, for the treatment of complex wounds such as burns and ulcers. The dermal products are commercialized through a network of distributors, primarily in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Products cleared for sale in the United States include HYALOMATRIX, HYALOFILL, HYALOGRAN, HYALOSAFE, and HYALOMATRIX 3D. In 2014, we entered into an agreement with Medline Industries, Inc. with a current expiration date of December 31, 2022 to commercialize HYALOMATRIX in the United States.
 
Our aesthetic dermatology product is a dermal filler based on our proprietary, chemically modified, cross-linked HA, and it is commercially available in select countries in the Middle East. Internationally, this product is marketed under the ELEVESS name. In the United States, the trade name is HYDRELLE, although the product is not currently marketed in the United States.
 
Surgical
 
Our surgical business consists of products used to prevent post-surgical adhesions after abdominal-pelvic, spinal, and ear, nose, and throat (“ENT”) surgeries. HYALOBARRIER is a clinically proven, post-operative adhesion barrier for use in the abdominopelvic area. The product is currently commercialized in Europe, the Middle East, and certain African and Asian countries through a distribution network, but it is not approved for sale in the United States. INCERT, approved for sale and commercialized through a network of distributors in Europe and Malaysia, is a chemically modified, cross-linked HA product, for the prevention of spinal post-surgical adhesions. There are currently no plans at this time to distribute INCERT in the United States.
 
Surgical adhesions occur when fibrous bands of tissues form between adjacent tissue layers during the wound healing process. Although surgeons attempt to minimize the formation of adhesions, they nevertheless occur quite frequently after surgery. Adhesions in the abdominal and pelvic cavity can cause particularly serious problems such as intestinal blockage following abdominal surgery and infertility following pelvic surgery. Fibrosis following spinal surgery can complicate re-operation and may cause pain.
 
We also offer several products used in connection with the treatment of ENT disorders. The lead products are MEROGEL, a woven fleece nasal packing, and MEROGEL INJECTABLE, a thick, viscous hydrogel composed of cross-linked hyaluronic acid—a biocompatible agent that creates a moist wound-healing environment. We have partnered with Medtronic XoMed, Inc. (“Medtronic”) for worldwide distribution of these ENT products.

Other
 
Our other products include our ophthalmic and veterinary products, which are legacy products and not a part of our core business. Our ophthalmic business includes injectable, high molecular weight HA products used as viscoelastic agents in ophthalmic surgical procedures such as cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. These products coat, lubricate, and protect sensitive tissue such as the endothelium, and they function to maintain the shape of the eye, thereby facilitating ophthalmic surgical procedures. Our veterinary product, HYVISC, is a high molecular weight injectable HA product for the treatment of joint dysfunction in horses due to non-infectious synovitis associated with equine osteoarthritis. HYVISC has viscoelastic properties that lubricate and protect the tissues in horse joints. HYVISC is distributed by Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc. (“Boehringer”) in the United States and in selected countries in the Middle East.

See also the section captioned “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our manufacturing processes involve inherent risks, and disruption could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of the sources and availability of raw materials related to the manufacture of our products.
 
Research and Development of Potential Products
 
Our research and development efforts primarily consist of the development of new medical applications for our HA-based technology, the management of clinical trials for certain product candidates, the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory approvals or clearances at all relevant stages of product development, and process development and scale-up manufacturing activities for our existing and new products. Our development focus includes products for tissue protection, repair, and regeneration. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, these expenses were $18.8 million, $10.7 million, and $9.0 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to commit significant resources to, and increase our aggregate spending on, research and development activities, including in relation to preclinical activities and clinical trials, in the future.
 
Our second single-injection osteoarthritis product under development in the United States is CINGAL, which is composed of our proprietary cross-linked HA material combined with an approved steroid, and it is designed to provide both short- and long-term pain relief to patients. We completed an initial CINGAL phase III clinical trial, including the associated statistical analysis for 368 enrolled patients, during the fourth quarter of 2014 with data indicating that the product met all primary and secondary endpoints relative to placebo set forth for the trial. During the first half of 2015, we completed a CINGAL retreatment study with 242 patients who had participated in the phase III clinical trial and reported safety data related to the retreatment study. This initial phase III clinical trial and the associated retreatment study supported the Health Canada and CE Mark approvals of the product. The commercial launch of the product in both Canada and the European Union occurred in the second quarter of 2016. In the United States, after discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) related to the regulatory pathway for CINGAL, we conducted a formal meeting with the FDA’s Office of Combination Products (“OCP”) to present and discuss our data in September 2015, and we submitted a formal request for designation with OCP a month later. In its response to our formal request for designation, OCP assigned the product to the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”) as the lead agency center for premarket review and regulation. We held a meeting with CDER in September 2016 to align on an approval framework and on submission requirements for a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for CINGAL, including the execution of an additional Phase III clinical trial to supplement our existing CINGAL pivotal study data. We submitted an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) in late 2016, and discussions with CDER indicated no objections to our clinical protocol design. As a result, we commenced work on this second Phase III clinical trial in the first quarter of 2017, and the first patient was treated in the second quarter of 2017. Enrollment of 576 patients in this second Phase III clinical trial was completed during October 2017. We expect to complete the six-month follow-up in this Phase III clinical trial during the second quarter of 2018 and to submit our NDA to FDA as expeditiously as possible thereafter. We have also initiated an additional three-month extended follow-up study in conjunction with the second Phase III clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of CINGAL over this longer period, and the first patients were enrolled in this follow-up study in the fourth quarter of 2017. This extended follow-up study will not impact the timeline for submission of the NDA for CINGAL following the completion of the second Phase III clinical trial.

We have several research and development programs underway for new products, including for HYALOFAST (in the United States), an innovative product for cartilage tissue repair, and other early stage regenerative medicine development programs. HYALOFAST received CE Mark approval in September 2009, and it is commercially available in Europe and certain international countries. During the first quarter of 2015, we submitted an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) for HYALOFAST to the FDA, which was approved in July 2015. We commenced patient enrollment in a clinical trial in December 2015, and we are advancing site initiations and patient enrollment activities. In the second quarter of 2016, a supplement to the HYALOFAST IDE was approved to expand the inclusion criteria for the clinical study. The purpose of this supplement is to allow us to increase enrollment rates with the ultimate goal of decreasing the time needed to complete the clinical trial. In addition, we are currently proceeding with other research and development programs, one of which utilizes our proprietary HA technology to treat pain associated with common repetitive overuse injuries, such as lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow. We submitted a CE Mark application for this treatment during the first quarter of 2016 and received a CE Mark for the treatment of pain associated with tennis elbow in December 2016. We expect to begin enrolling patients in a post-market clinical study in relation to the CE Mark for this product before the end of the second quarter of 2018. Outside of the United States, this product will be marketed under the trade name ORTHOVISC-T. In the second quarter of 2016, we submitted an IDE to the FDA to conduct a phase III clinical trial for this treatment, which was approved by the FDA in June 2016. We also have other research and development programs underway focused on expanding the indications of our current products, including one program being conducted and funded by our U.S. MONOVISC distribution partner, Mitek, seeking to expand MONOVISC’s indication to include the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis of the hip. In the third quarter of 2017, we also submitted an application to the FDA for 510(k) clearance of an injectable HA-based bone repair treatment. The 510(k) clearance was received from FDA in December 2017. In addition to other early stage research and developments initiatives we are currently undertaking, we are working to expand our regenerative medicine pipeline with a new product candidate in the form of an implant for rotator cuff repair utilizing our proprietary solid HA.
 
In June 2015, we entered into an agreement with the Institute for Applied Life Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to collaborate on research to develop a novel modality for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The agreement with the University of Massachusetts Amherst was extended in January 2018, and the next phase of the research will focus on optimizing the drug delivery system with the goal of advancing a novel therapeutic candidate into clinical trials to support regulatory submission. We also recently entered into an agreement with the University of Liverpool to develop an injectable mesenchymal stem cell therapy for the treatment of age-related osteoarthritis with the goal of bringing a therapeutics candidate through clinical trials to market to meet an unmet therapeutic need.
 
Our research and development efforts may not be successful in (1) developing our existing product candidates, (2) expanding the therapeutic applications of our existing products, or (3) resulting in new applications for our HA technology. There is also a risk that we may choose not to pursue development of potential product candidates. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any new applications we develop. Furthermore, even if all regulatory approvals are obtained, there can be no assurances that we will achieve meaningful sales of such products or applications.

See also the section captioned “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Failure to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, FDA or other U.S. and foreign governmental approvals for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.” for a discussion regarding the impact of government regulations on our product development activities.
 
Patent and Proprietary Rights
 
Our products and trademarks, including our corporate name, product names, and logos, are proprietary. We rely on a combination of patent protection, trade secrets and trademark laws, license agreements, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary information.
 
We have a policy of seeking patent protection for patentable aspects of our proprietary technology. In the United States, we own 20 patents, 1 of which is co-owned with other parties, license 12 patents, and have 4 patent applications currently pending. These U.S. patents have expiration dates through 2030. Internationally, we own 167 patents, 7 of which are co-owned with other parties, license 79 patents, and have 12 patent applications currently pending. Outside of the United States, we own, co-own, license, or have filed for patents in 34 jurisdictions. Our international patents have expiration dates through 2032. In 2017, we were granted 18 new patents in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Many of these patents, including all licensed patents, belong to the Anika S.r.l. patent estate, which is extensive and partly intertwined with its former parent company Fidia Farmaceutici S.p.A. (“Fidia”) through a patent licensing agreement that provides Anika S.r.l. with access to certain of Fidia’s patents to the extent required to support Anika S.r.l.’s products. In 2017, 2 of the patents belonging to the Anika S.r.l. patent estate expired in the United States, and 4 expired internationally. We intend to seek patent protection for products and processes developed in the course of our activities when we believe such protection is in our best interests and when the cost of seeking such protection is not inordinate relative to the potential benefits.
 
Other entities have filed patent applications for, or have been issued patents concerning, various aspects of HA-related products or processes. In addition, the products or processes we develop may infringe the patent rights of others in the future. Any such infringement may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
We rely upon trade secrets and proprietary know-how for certain non-patented aspects of our technology. To protect such information, we require certain customers and vendors, and all employees, consultants, and licensees to enter into confidentiality agreements limiting the disclosure and use of such information. These agreements, however, may not provide adequate protection.
 
See also the section captioned “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could have a material impact on our business and future financial results” for a discussion of the risks we face with respect to protecting intellectual property we develop.
 
We have granted Mitek an exclusive and non-transferable, royalty-bearing license to develop, commercialize, and sell ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC in the United States pursuant to the Mitek ORTHOVISC Agreement and the Mitek MONOVISC Agreement. These agreements include a license to manufacture and have manufactured such products in the event that we are unable to supply Mitek with ORTHOVISC or MONOVISC in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreement. We have also granted Mitek the exclusive, royalty free right to use the trademarks ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC in connection with the marketing, distribution, and sale of the licensed products within the United States.
 
Government Regulation
 
The clinical development, manufacturing, and marketing of our products are subject to governmental regulation in the United States, the European Union, and other territories worldwide. Various statutes, regulations, directives, and guidelines, including the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the United States, govern the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, and promotion of our products. Product development and approval within these various regulatory frameworks takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are also inspected regularly by the FDA and other applicable regulatory bodies.

Medical products regulated by the FDA are generally classified as drugs, biologics, or medical devices. Drugs and biologic products undergo rigorous preclinical testing prior to beginning clinical trials. Clinical trials for new drugs or biologic products include Phase I trials in healthy volunteers to understand safety, dosage tolerance, and pharmacokinetics, Phase II trials in a limited patient population to identify initial efficacy and side effects, and Phase III pivotal trials to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product. Medical devices intended for human use are classified into three categories (Class I, II or III) on the basis of the controls deemed reasonably necessary by the FDA to assure their safety and effectiveness. Class II devices are cleared for marketing under the premarket notification 510(k) regulatory pathway, which may include clinical testing. Class III devices require pre-market approval based on valid scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness, including evidence elicited through appropriate clinical testing. The failure to adequately demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of a product under development can delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product. In order to gain marketing approval, we must submit to the relevant regulatory authority for review information on the quality aspects of the product as well as the non-clinical and clinical data. The FDA undertakes this review in the United States.
 
In the European Union, medical devices must be CE Marked in order to be marketed. CE marking a device involves working with a Notified Body, and in some cases a Competent Authority, to demonstrate that the device meets all applicable requirements of the Medical Devices Directive and that our Quality Management System is compliant. Drug approval in the European Union follows one of several possible processes: (i) a centralized procedure involving members of the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use; (ii) a “mutual recognition procedure” in which an individual country's regulatory agency approves the product followed by “mutual recognition” of this approval by regulatory agencies of other countries; or (iii) a decentralized procedure in which the approval is sought through the regulatory agencies of multiple countries at the same time.
 
Approval timelines can range from several months to several years, or applications can be denied entirely. The approval process can be affected by a number of factors. For example, additional studies or clinical trials may be requested during the review, which may delay marketing approval and involve unbudgeted costs. As a condition of approval, the regulatory agency may require post-marketing surveillance to monitor for adverse effects, and may require other additional studies, as it deems appropriate. After approval for an initial indication, further clinical studies are generally necessary to gain approval for any additional indications. The terms of any approval, including labeling content, may be more restrictive than expected and could affect the marketability of a product.
 
As a condition of approval, the relevant regulatory agency requires that the product continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements related to quality, safety, and efficacy, and it requires strict procedures to monitor and report any adverse effects. Where adverse effects occur or may occur, the regulatory agency may require additional studies or changes to the labeling. Compelling new “adverse” data may result in a product approval being withdrawn at any stage following review by an agency and discussion with the product manufacturer.
 
The branch of the FDA responsible for product marketing oversight routinely reviews company marketing practices and also may impose pre-clearance requirements on materials intended for use in marketing of approved drug products. We are also subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Similar review and regulation of advertising and marketing practices exists in the other geographic areas where we operate.
 
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, including, without limitation, issuing an FDA Form 483 notice of inspectional observations or a warning letter, imposing civil money penalties, suspending or delaying issuance of approvals, requiring product recall, imposing a total or partial shutdown of production, withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted, pursuing product seizures, consent decrees or other injunctive relief, or criminal prosecution through the Department of Justice. The FDA can also require us to repair, replace, or refund the cost of products that we manufactured or distributed. Outside the United States, regulatory agencies may exert a range of similar powers.

Competition
 
We compete with many companies including large pharmaceutical firms and specialized medical products companies across all of our product lines. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs, more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations, and more experience in the regulatory processes than we have. We also compete with academic institutions, government agencies, and other research organizations, which may be involved in the research and development and commercialization of products. Many of our competitors also compete against us in securing relationships with collaborators for their research and development and commercialization programs.
 
We compete with other market participants primarily on the efficacy of our products, our products’ reputation for safety, our focus on HA-based products, and the breadth of our HA-based product portfolio. Other factors that impact competition in our industry are the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability of raw material and finished product supply, marketing and sales capability, reimbursement coverage, product pricing, and patent protection. Some of the principal factors that may affect our ability to compete in the HA development and commercialization markets include:
 

· | The quality and breadth of our continued development of our technology portfolio;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our ability to complete successful clinical studies and obtain FDA marketing and foreign regulatory approvals prior to our competitors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The successful execution of our commercial strategies, including our direct commercialization initiative for CINGAL;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | The availability of capital resources to fund strategic activities related to the significant expansion of our business or product portfolio.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We are aware of several companies that are developing and/or marketing products utilizing HA for a variety of human applications. In some cases, competitors have already obtained product approvals, submitted applications for approval, or commenced human clinical studies, either in the United States or in certain foreign countries. All of our products face substantial competition. There exist major worldwide competing products, made from HA and other materials, for use in orthopedics, surgical adhesion prevention, advanced wound care, ENT, cosmetic dermatology, ophthalmic surgery, and the treatment of equine osteoarthritis. There is a risk that we will be unable to compete effectively against our current or future competitors. Additionally, legislation and regulation aimed at curbing rising healthcare costs has resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to create larger companies, including hospitals, with greater market power. In turn, this has led to greater and more intense competition in the provision of products and services to market participants. Important market makers, like group purchasing organizations, have increased their negotiating leverage, and if these market makers demand significant price concessions or if we are excluded as a supplier by these market makers, our product revenue could be adversely impacted.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 123 employees, 21 of whom were located outside the United States. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions, but certain employees based in Italy are represented by unions, adding complexity and additional risks to the wage and employment decision processes.
Environmental Laws
 
We believe that we are in compliance with all foreign, federal, state, and local environmental regulations with respect to our manufacturing facilities and that the cost of ongoing compliance with such regulations does not have a material effect on our operations.
Product Liability
 
The testing, marketing, and sale of human health care products entails an inherent risk of allegations of product liability, and we cannot assure that substantial product liability claims will not be asserted against us. Although we have not received any material product liability claims to date and have coverage under our insurance policy of $5.0 million per occurrence and $5.0 million in the aggregate, we cannot assure that if material claims arise in the future, our insurance will be adequate to cover all situations. Moreover, we cannot assure that such insurance, or additional insurance, if required, will be available in the future or, if available, will be available on commercially reasonable terms. Any product liability claim, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.
