ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
 
We believe that we are one of the leading professional designers and manufacturers of high quality 24-karat gold jewelry and Chinese ornaments. We develop, promote and sell a broad range of products to the rapidly expanding jewelry market across the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC. We offer a wide range of in-house designed products including, but not limited to, gold necklaces, rings, earrings, bracelets, and pendants. We have built a partnership with the Jewelry Institute of China University of Geosciences to help us design new products.
 
We have historically sold our products directly to distributors, retailers and other wholesalers, who then sell our products to consumers through retail counters located in both department stores and other traditional stand-alone jewelry stores. We sell our products to our customers at a price that reflects the market price of the base material, plus a mark-up reflecting our design fees and processing fees. Typically this mark-up is approximately ranges from 3% – 6% of the price of the base material. In April 2015, we established a new subsidiary Wuhan Kingold Internet Co., Ltd. and started the online sales of our jewelry products to customers. However, the online sales were immaterial for 2015 and 2016. In May 2015, Kingold Internet established a 100% controlled subsidiary Yuhuang Jewelry Design Co., Ltd (“Yuhuang”). Yuhuang engages in the jewelry design business.
 
On December 14, 2016, Wuhan Kingold transferred its 55% ownership interest in Kingold Internet to Wuhan Kingold Industrial Group Co., Ltd., a related party, for a consideration of $79,196 (RMB 550,000). After the transfer, Kingold Internet and Yuhuang were no longer the subsidiaries of Wuhan Kingold.
 
We aim to become an increasingly important participant in the PRC’s gold jewelry design and manufacturing sector. In addition to expanding our design and manufacturing capabilities, our goal is to provide a large variety of gold products in unique styles and superior quality under our brand, Kingold.
 
Beginning in 2016, we started investing in gold, in addition to purchasing gold for inventory. We borrowed money to finance the purchase of gold, which gold was then pledged to secure the loans. In some cases, the unrestricted gold available for production was insufficient to provide adequate security for such loans, which in turn required us to lease gold from a related party to satisfy the loan conditions and conduct the operations. In 2017 and 2018, we continued to expand our investment in gold, which also resulted in growing loan amount to fuel the expansion. We are expected to adjust our gold investment according to the gold market changes.

Industry and Market Overview
 
The Global Market
 
Global consumer demand for gold in 2018 reached 4,345.1 tons, an increase of 4.5% comparing to 4,159.9 tons in 2017. Gold demand in 2018 was in line with the five-year average of 4,347.5 tons. A multi-decade high in central bank buying drove growth. Investment in bars and coins accelerated in the second half of the year of 2018, up 4% to 1,090.2 tons in 2018. Full year jewelry demand was steady at 2,200 tons. Gold used in technology climbed marginally to 334.6 tons in 2018,


According to the World Gold Council, China and India continue to consume the most jewelry of any market in the world, and in 2018 together generated 58% of total annual jewelry demand globally. China consumed a total of 672.5 tons of jewelry in 2018, while India consumed 598 tons.
 
The PRC Market
 
China’s market for jewelry and other luxury goods is expanding rapidly over the decade, in large part due to China’s rapid economic growth. According to the State Bureau of Statistics of China, China’s real gross domestic product, or GDP, grew by approximately 6.6% and 6.9% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Economic growth in China has led to greater levels of personal disposable income and increased spending among China’s expanding consumer base. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, private consumption has grown at a 9.0% compound annual growth rate over the last decade.
 
According to the World Gold Council, over the last ten years, Chinese gold consumers have displayed a remarkably consistent attitude towards gold. Chinese demand is primarily driven by: (i) the continued urbanization of the Chinese population; (ii) the dominance of 24-karat gold and its role as a savings proxy; and (iii) increasing availability of gold investment products to a populace with a growing awareness of gold’s investment properties, particularly in light of its role as an inflation hedge.
 
In volume terms, Chinese consumer demand for gold investment increased in 2018. Chinese total consumer demand for gold investment (mainly bars and coins) reached 304.2 tons in 2018. China was the world’s largest bar and coin market in 2018, recording it third highest year of bar and coin demand on record. Annual demand in 2018 was consistent compared to 2017 and comfortably above its five-year average of 264.3 tons.
 
We believe that China’s gold jewelry market will continue to grow as China’s economy continues to develop. Since gold has long been a symbol of wealth and prosperity in China, demand for gold jewelry, particularly 24-karat gold jewelry, is firmly embedded in the country’s culture. Gold has long been viewed as both a secure and accessible savings vehicle, and as a symbol of wealth and prosperity in Chinese culture.
 
In addition, gold jewelry plays an important role in marriage ceremonies, child birth, and other major life events in China. Gold ornaments, often in the shapes of dragons, horses and other cultural icons, have long been a customary gift for newly married couples and newborn children in China. As China’s population becomes more urban, more westernized, and more affluent, gold, platinum and other precious metal jewelry are becoming increasingly popular and affordable fashion accessories. The gold jewelry market is currently benefiting from rising consumer spending and rapid urbanization of the Chinese population. We believe that jewelry companies like us, with a developed distribution network, attractive designs, and reliable product quality, are well-positioned to build up our brands and capture an increasing share of China’s growing gold jewelry market.

Our Strengths
 
We believe the following strengths contribute to our competitive advantages and differentiate us from our competitors:
    We have a proven manufacturing capability.
 
We have developed seven proprietary processes that we believe are well integrated and are crucial to gold jewelry manufacturing, namely the processes for 99.9% gold hardening, rubber mold opening efficiency, solder-less welding, pattern carving, chain weaving, dewaxing casting, and our coloring methods.
 
We have a proven design capability.
 
We have a large and experienced in-house design team with a track record of developing products that are fashionable and well received in the jewelry market. We have built up an exclusive partnership with the leading jewelry school in China, the Jewelry Institute of China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), to help us design and launch new products. We are committed to further strengthening our design team and continuing to improve the quality and novelty of our products so as to capture increased market share in the high-end gold jewelry market.
 
We believe that we have superior brand awareness in China.
 
We have established the Kingold brand through our focused sales and marketing efforts, and we believe that it is well known in China. We continue to devote significant efforts towards brand development and marketing in an attempt to enhance the market recognition of our products, such as our Mgold jewelry line of products. Our brand awareness was demonstrated in part by “Kingold” being named a “Famous Brand in Hubei Province,” “Famous Brand in China,” and “Famous Jewelry Brand”. We believe these awards have added credibility to and strengthened customers’ confidence in our products. We have also participated in various exhibitions and trade fairs to promote our products and brands.
 
We have a well-established distribution network throughout China.
 
We have been actively operating in this industry for more than ten years. In the jewelry industry, a well-established and well-maintained distribution network is critical to success. We have established stable and mutually beneficial business relationships with a range of business partners, including large distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. These relationships are essential to our company, and provide us with a key competitive advantage. We have distributors in most provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in PRC.
 
We believe that we have significant advantages in the areas of capacity, technology and talent when compared to our competitors.
 
We have expanded our capacity significantly in recent years. In 2015, we processed 24-karat gold jewelry and Chinese ornaments with a total weight of approximately 56.5 tons, which was slightly decreased as compared to prior year production of approximately 60.1 tons in 2014. In fiscal 2016, our actual production was 75.3 tons, which was substantially increased as compared to the production in 2015. In fiscal 2017, our actual production was 103.4 tons, In fiscal 2018, our actual production was 114.2 tons, which indicated a continuing strong increase as compared to the production in 2017 and 2016. We attach great importance to the continuous improvement of our technology. Our gold processing systems dramatically reduce waste during the manufacturing process to approximately just one gram per kilogram of gold.
 
We have been awarded 26 patents granted by the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC, of which 2 expired in 2017, 21 will expire in 2019, and the remaining will expire in 2029. We also owned 17 trademarks at the end of 2017, of which, 1 will expire by 2019, 6 will expire by 2020, 4 will expire by 2021, 1 will expire by 2023 and 3 will expire by 2027, and 2 were registered in Hong Kong. We have made significant investments in training and retaining our own in-house design and manufacturing team. We have an exclusive agreement with the China University of Geosciences School of Jewelry in Wuhan, or the School of Jewelry in Wuhan, which provides us with new, unique and innovative designs through students majoring in jewelry design and jewelry processing technology. These designs are proprietary to us, so our competitors do not have access to these designs. We also provide internships to talented students at the School of Jewelry, which provides us with access to the designs that we believe are best suited for strong consumer sales.

We are a member of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, which has very limited membership and which affords the right to purchase gold directly from the Shanghai Gold Exchange.
 
We have been a member of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, or the Exchange, since 2003. Although the Chinese government eliminated the absolute restriction on trading gold in general, the right to purchase gold directly from the Exchange is limited. The Exchange possesses a membership system and only members can buy gold through its trading system. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 253 members of the Exchange throughout China. Non-members who want to purchase gold must deal with members of the Exchange at a higher purchase price compared to the price afforded to members of the Exchange.
 
We have an experienced management team in the Chinese gold industry.
 
We have a strong and stable management team with valuable experience in the PRC jewelry industry. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Zhihong Jia, has been working in this industry for close to 20 years. Our general manager, Mr. Jun Wang, also has worked in the industry for more than a decade. Other members of our senior management team all have significant experience in key aspects of our operations, including product design, manufacturing, and sales and marketing.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to be the leading designer and manufacturer of 24-karat gold jewelry products and to become a sizable supplier of investment gold products in China. We intend to achieve our goal by implementing the following strategies:
 
We intend to increase production capacity and marketing abilities through both existing channels and the planned Jewelry Park.
 
We intend to continue to expand the production capacity with our self-generated cash flow as well as bank loans.
 
We also intend to consider sub-contracting opportunities in order to further expand capacity. Given the fragmentation of the PRC gold jewelry and design industry, we believe there may be attractive consolidation opportunities for us to acquire other jewelers, which would allow us to further increase our market share and achieve economies of scale.
 
We also intend to increase our production capacity and marketing abilities through forming relationships with other jewelry manufacturers in China, to whom we plan to lease space in our planned Jewelry Park.
 
We plan to continue to specialize in the manufacture of 24-karat gold jewelry.
 
We intend to leverage our experience in jewelry design to introduce new fashionable products with strong market recognition, such as our Mgold jewelry line of products, to target niche markets such as the fast growing wedding market. We plan to design new product lines of 24-karat gold jewelry to address the specific needs of our target customers. By staying on top of market trends, and expanding our design team and capabilities, we plan to continue to increase our revenues and market share.
 
We intend to further promote and improve the use of our brand recognition.
 
We intend to make continuous efforts in growing the brand recognition of our Kingold brand and increasing our market share. Through marketing and the promotion of our high-end product lines such as Mgold, we believe the credentials and reputation of our brand will be further enhanced.
 
We will increase the automation in our production line.
 
Our production lines use modern technologies and production techniques that we continuously strive to improve. We plan to increase the level of automation in our production lines, which will lower our average costs and expand our production capacity. With our entrance into the investment gold market, we intend to rely more on automated production processes.

We intend to enlarge our PRC customer base.
 
We intend to strive to expand our PRC customer base by strengthening current relationships with distributors, retailers and other wholesalers in our existing markets. We also plan to expand upon our customer base by developing new relationships with strategic distributors and retailers in markets we have not yet penetrated and adding customers in the PRC.
 
Products
 
We currently offer a wide range of 24-karat gold products, including 99.9% and 99% pure gold necklaces, rings, earrings, bracelets, pendants and gold bars.
 
Design and Manufacturing
 
We have adopted a systematic approach to product design and manufacturing that we believe is rigorous. We employ a senior design team with members educated by top art schools or colleges in China, including an exclusive agreement with the School of Jewelry in Wuhan, who have an average of three to five years of experience. Our design team develops and generates new ideas from a variety of sources, including direct customer feedback, trade shows, and industry conferences. We generally test the market potential and customer appeal of our new products and services through a wide outreach program in specific regions prior to a full commercial launch. We have a large-scale production base that includes a 74,933 square foot factory, a dedicated design, sales and marketing team, and 630 company-trained employees. Our production lines include automated jewelry processing equipment and procedures that we can rapidly modify to accommodate new designs and styles.
Supply of Raw Materials
 
We purchase gold, our major raw material, directly from the Shanghai Gold Exchange. Our membership grants us the right to purchase gold from the Exchange, a right that is not available to non-members. We also leased gold from certain leading Chinese commercial banks to provide an additional supply of raw materials under certain gold lease arrangements in 2015, 2016 and 2017. We did not enter into any gold lease transactions in fiscal year 2018.
Security Measures
 
We believe that we implement the best of breed security measures to protect our assets, including our 24-karat gold, and we believe these measures are well beyond those of our competitors. Our comprehensive security measures at our Wuhan facility include (i) a 24-hour onsite police station with direct deployment of police officers and instant access to the Wuhan city police department and (ii) security guards at each point of entry. Security guards roam our facilities, and monitor security cameras (with video surveillance by both random and fixed cameras) and alarm systems in our warehouse. Our gold is stored in a state of the art vault with encryption and authentication technology, which requires several designated management employees to open the vault, all of whom have different access codes known only to a limited number of officers. Therefore, no one individual can open our vault without the access codes of the others. In addition, every employee or visitor is required to pass through a security check (to include a metal detector) when he or she enters and leaves the jewelry production area. We review our security measures on an annual basis and regularly look to upgrade our systems after such review.
Quality Control
 
We consider quality control an important factor for the success of our business. We have a strict quality control system that is implemented by a well-trained team to ensure effective quality control over every step of our business operations, from design and manufacturing to marketing and sales. We have received ISO 9001 accreditation from the International Organization for Standardization attesting to our quality control systems. In 2004, we were named an “Honest and Trustworthy Enterprise” by the Hubei Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision.

Sales and Marketing 
 
Currently we have approximately 360 customers covering 23 provinces in China. We have very stable relationships with our major customers who have generally increased order volume year by year. In 2013, we renovated our showroom and we add an additional showroom at Kingold Industrial Park in 2017.
Major Customers
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 23.3% of our net sales were generated from our five largest customers. Wuhan Kingold Industrial Group Co. Ltd., a related party, was our largest customer in 2017 (6.3% of our total net sales in 2017).
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 23.9% of our net sales were generated from our five largest customers. Zhengzhou Jinmeifu Jewelry Co., Ltd. was our largest customer in 2018 (5.2% of our total net sales in 2018). No customer accounted for more than 10% of annual sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.


Competition
 
The jewelry industry in China is highly fragmented and very competitive. No single competitor has a significant percentage of the overall market. We believe that the market may become even more competitive as the industry grows and/or consolidates.
 
We produce high-quality jewelry for which the demand has grown year by year as income levels in China have risen and customers continue to appreciate the high quality of our products. We believe the Kingold brand is well-recognized within the industry across China, which has substantially differentiated us from most of our competitors.
 
We compete with local jewelry manufacturers and large foreign multinational companies that offer products similar to ours. Examples of our competitors include, but are not limited to, Zhejiang Sun & Moon Jewelry Group Co., Ltd. (listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange), Shenzhen Bo Fook Jewelry Co., Ltd., Shenzhen Ganlu Jewelry Co., Ltd., Magfrey Jewelry Co., Ltd., and Guangdong Chaohongji Co., Ltd.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights and to maintain and enhance our competitiveness in the jewelry industry.
 
We currently have 24 patents granted by the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC, of which 21 will expire in 2019 and the remaining will expire in 2029.
 
We currently have 15 registered trademarks in China, of which 1 will expire in 2019, 6 will expire in 2020, 4 will expire in 2021, 1 will expire in 2023, and the remaining 3 will expire in 2027. In particular, “Kingold” has been named as a “Famous Brand in Hubei Province,” “Famous Brand in China,” and “Famous Jewelry Brand” by the General Administration of Quality Supervision and China Top Brand Strategy Promotion Committee .


We have implemented and enhanced intellectual property management procedures in an effort to protect our intellectual property rights. However, there can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us, or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of China may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws in other jurisdictions.

PRC Government Regulations 
 
We are subject to various PRC laws and regulations that are relevant to our business. Our business license permits us to design, manufacture, sell and market jewelry products to department stores throughout China, and allows us to engage in the retail distribution of our products. Any further amendment to the scope of our business will require additional government approvals. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary government approval for any change or expansion of our business.
 
Under applicable PRC laws, the supply of precious metals such as platinum, gold and silver is highly regulated by certain government agencies, such as the People’s Bank of China, or the PBOC. The Shanghai Gold Exchange is the only PBOC authorized supplier of precious metal materials and is our primary source of supply for our raw materials, which substantially consist of precious metals. We are required to obtain and hold several memberships and approval certificates from these government agencies in order to continue to conduct our business. We may be required to renew such memberships and to obtain approval certificates periodically. If we are unable to renew these periodic memberships or approval certificates, it would materially affect our business operations. We are currently in good standing with these agencies.
 
We have also been granted independent import and export rights. These rights permit us to import and export jewelry into and out of China. With the relatively lower cost of production in China, we intend to expand into overseas markets after the launch of our China-based retail plan. We do not currently have plans to import jewelry into China.
 
Environmental Protection
 
Our production facilities in Wuhan are subject to environmental regulation by both the central government of the PRC and by local government agencies. We have obtained all necessary operating permits as required from the Environmental Protection Bureau, and believe that we are in compliance with local regulations governing waste production and disposal, and that our production facilities have met the public safety requirements regarding refuse, emissions, lights, noise and radiation. Since commencement of our operations, we have not been cited for any environmental violations. Because our production process creates almost no waste water or pollution, our costs for environmental compliance have been minimal and immaterial.
Tax
 
Wuhan Kingold was incorporated in the PRC and is subject to PRC income tax, which is computed according to the relevant laws and regulations in the PRC. The applicable income tax rate is 25.0%.
 
Pursuant to the Provisional Regulation of China on Value-Added Tax, or VAT, and its implementing rules, all entities and individuals that are engaged in the sale of goods, the provision of repairs and replacement services and the importation of goods in China are generally required to pay VAT at a rate of 16% starting from May 1, 2018 for the gross sales proceeds received, less any deductible VAT already paid or borne by the taxpayer.
 
Recent U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Reform”), was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Reform significantly modified the U.S. Internal Revenue Code by, among other things, reducing the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017; limiting and/or eliminating many business deductions; migrating the U.S. to a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously deferred foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries; subject to certain limitations, generally eliminating U.S. corporate income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; and providing for new taxes on certain foreign earnings. Taxpayers may elect to pay the one-time transition tax over eight years or in a single lump sum. The U.S. Tax Reform also includes provisions for a new tax on GILTI effective for tax years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 2017. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of controlled foreign corporations (“CFCs”), subject to the possible use of foreign tax credits and a deduction equal to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability, subject to some limitations.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a one-time transition tax of approximately $10.8 million that represented management’s assessment of the amount of U.S. corporate income tax based on the deemed repatriation to the United States of the Company’s previously deferred earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and VIE of the Company mandated by the U.S. Tax Reform. U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the Tax Act may require adjustments and changes in our assessment. The Company provided an additional $0.9 million for the interest and penalty due on the late payment of the one-time transition tax.

Foreign Currency Exchange
 
Under applicable PRC foreign currency exchange regulations, the Renminbi is convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Conversion of Renminbi for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, security investment and repatriation of investment, however, is still subject to the approval of the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE. Foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies at those banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from the SAFE. Capital investments by foreign-invested enterprises outside of China are also subject to limitations, which include approvals by the Ministry of Commerce, the SAFE and the State Reform and Development Commission.
Dividend Distributions
 
Under applicable PRC regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a foreign-invested enterprise in China is required to set aside at least 10.0% of its after-tax profits each year to its general reserves until the cumulative amount of such reserves has reached 50.0% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of a foreign-invested enterprise has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 630 full-time employees, all of whom were located in PRC except for our Chief Financial Officer. There are no collective bargaining contracts covering any of our employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory. Our full-time employees are entitled to employee benefits including medical care, work related injury insurance, maternity insurance, unemployment insurance and pension benefits through a Chinese government mandated multi-employer defined contribution plan. We are required to accrue those benefits based on certain percentages of the employees’ salaries and make contributions to the plans out of the amounts accrued for medical and pension benefits. The Chinese government is responsible for the medical benefits and the pension liability paid to these employees.


The PRC has a labor contract law that enhances rights for the nation’s workers, including open-ended work contracts and severance payments, and requires employers to enter into labor contracts with their workers in writing, restricts the use of temporary laborers and makes it harder to lay off employees. It also requires that employees with a fixed-term contract be entitled to an indefinite-term contract after the fixed-term contract has been renewed twice. Although the labor contract law could increase our labor costs, we do not anticipate there will be any significant effects on our overall profitability in the near future because such amount was historically not material to our operating cost. Management anticipates this may be a step toward improving candidate retention for skilled workers.

Company History
 
Since December 2009, we have been engaged in the design, manufacturing and sale of gold jewelry in the PRC via a VIE relationship with Wuhan Kingold, a PRC company.
 
We were initially incorporated in 1995 in Delaware as Vanguard Enterprises, Inc. In 1999, we changed our corporate name to Activeworlds.com, Inc. (and subsequently to Activeworlds Corp.), and through a wholly-owned subsidiary we provided internet software products and services that enabled the delivery of three-dimensional content over the internet. We operated that business until September 11, 2002, when we sold that business to our former management and we became a shell company with no significant business operations. As a result of the consummation of a reverse acquisition transaction as described below, on December 23, 2009, we ceased to be a shell company and became an indirect holding company for Wuhan Vogue-Show Jewelry Co., Limited, or Vogue-Show, through Dragon Lead Group Limited, or Dragon Lead.
 
Acquisition of Kingold and Name Change
 
In December 2009, we acquired 100% of Dragon Lead from the shareholders of Dragon Lead in a share exchange transaction pursuant to which the shareholders of Dragon Lead exchanged 100% ownership in Dragon Lead for 33,104,234 shares of our common stock. As a result, Dragon Lead became our wholly owned subsidiary. Dragon Lead owns 100% of Vogue-Show and Vogue-Show controls Wuhan Kingold through a series of variable interest entity agreements. We currently operate through Dragon Lead and Vogue-Show.
 
In February 2010, we changed our name to Kingold Jewelry, Inc. to better reflect our business.
 
Organizational History of Dragon Lead and its Subsidiaries
 
Dragon Lead, a British Virgin Islands, or BVI corporation was incorporated in the BVI on July 1, 2008 as an investment holding company. Dragon Lead owns 100% of the ownership interest in Vogue-Show.
 
Vogue-Show was incorporated in the PRC as a wholly foreign owned enterprise, or WFOE, on February 16, 2009. Wuhan Kingold was incorporated in the PRC as a limited liability company on August 2, 2002 by Zhihong Jia, as the major shareholder, and Xue Su Yue who sold her shares in Wuhan Kingold to Zhihong Jia and Chen Wei in 2003. On October 26, 2007, Wuhan Kingold was restructured as a joint stock company limited by shares. Its business activities are principally the design and manufacture of gold ornaments in the PRC. Wuhan Kingold’s business license will expire on July 1, 2052 and is renewable upon expiration. The registered and paid-in capital of Wuhan Kingold is RMB 120 million.

The Vogue-Show/Wuhan Kingold VIE Relationship 
 
On June 30, 2009, Vogue-Show entered into a series of agreements with Wuhan Kingold and shareholders holding 95.83% of the outstanding equity of Wuhan Kingold under which Wuhan Kingold agreed to pay 95.83% of its after-tax profits to Vogue-Show and shareholders owning 95.83% of Wuhan Kingold’s shares have pledged their and delegated their voting power in Wuhan Kingold to Vogue-Show. Such share pledge is registered with the PRC Administration for Industry and Commerce. These agreements were subsequently amended on October 20, 2011; when the minority stockholder holding 4.17% of the equity of Wuhan Kingold became a party to the applicable VIE agreements. Following execution of the amendments, shareholders holding 100% of the outstanding equity of Wuhan Kingold were parties to the agreements such that Wuhan Kingold has agreed to pay 100% of its after-tax profits to Vogue-Show and shareholders owning 100% of Wuhan Kingold’s shares have pledged and delegated their voting power in Wuhan Kingold to Vogue- Show.
 
The VIE agreements, which are described below, currently cover 100% of the equity interest in Wuhan Kingold, and were initially created so that upon the closing of the reverse acquisition, as described below, we would be able to acquire control of Wuhan Kingold, as explained below.
 
These contractual arrangements enable us to:
 

· | exercise effective control over our variable interest entity, Wuhan Kingold;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | receive substantially all of the economic benefits from variable interest entity, Wuhan Kingold; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reverse Acquisition and Private Placement
 
On September 29, 2009, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reverse Acquisition with Vogue-Show, Dragon Lead, and the stockholders of Dragon Lead, or the Dragon Lead Stockholders. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, we agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Dragon Lead in exchange for the issuance of 33,104,234 newly issued shares of our common stock. The acquisition agreement closed on or about December 23, 2009. Following the closing, Dragon Lead became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
The purpose of the reverse acquisition was to acquire control over Wuhan Kingold. We did not acquire Wuhan Kingold directly through the issuance of stock to Wuhan Kingold’s stockholders because under PRC law it is uncertain whether a share exchange would be legal. We instead chose to acquire control of Wuhan Kingold through the acquisition of Vogue-Show and the VIE arrangements previously described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain rules and regulations in the PRC restrict the ability of non-PRC companies that are controlled by PRC residents to acquire PRC companies. There is significant uncertainty as to whether these rules and regulations require transactions of the type contemplated by our VIE arrangements, or of the type contemplated by the Call Option described below, to be approved by the PRC Ministry of Commerce, the China Securities and Regulatory Commission, or other agencies.
 
On December 23, 2009, immediately prior to the closing of the reverse acquisition, we completed a private placement with 14 investors. Pursuant to a securities purchase agreement entered into with the investors, we sold an aggregate of 5,120,483 newly issued shares of our common stock at $0.996 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $5.1 million. The investors in the private placement also received five-year warrants to purchase up to 1,024,096 shares of common stock at the price of $0.996 per share. After commissions and expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately $4.55 million in the private placement. In addition, five-year warrants to purchase up to 1,536,145 shares of common stock at the price of $0.996 per share were issued to various consultants who assisted in the transaction.
 
All share and per share information for dates prior to August 10, 2010 concerning our common stock in the above discussion reflects a 1-for-2 reverse stock split.
 
As a result of the above transactions, we ceased being a “shell company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Act.
