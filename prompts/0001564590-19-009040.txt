ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Our Company
 Business Overview
 We are a leading provider of diversified mineral-based and material solutions for the Industrial and Energy markets.  We produce a wide range of specialized silica sand, feldspar, nepheline syenite, calcium carbonate, clay, kaolin, lime, and lime products for use in the glass, ceramics, coatings, foundry, polymers, construction, water filtration, sports and recreation, and oil and gas markets in North America and around the world.  We currently have 44 active mining facilities with over 50 million tons of annual mineral processing capacity and six active coating facilities with more than two million tons of annual coating capacity.  Our mining and coating facilities span North America and also include operations in China and Denmark.  Our U.S., Mexico, and Canada operations are among the largest, most flexible, and cost-efficient facilities in the industry with many sites in close proximity to our customer base.  
 Our operations are organized into two segments based on the primary end markets we serve – Energy and Industrial.  Our Energy segment offers the oil and gas industry a comprehensive portfolio of raw frac sand, value-added proppants, well-cementing additives, gravel-packing media and drilling mud additives that meet or exceed the standards set by the American Petroleum Institute (“API”).  Our products serve hydraulic fracturing operations in the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Mexico, China, and northern Europe.  The Energy segment represented approximately 60% of our total revenues for 2018.  
 Our Industrial segment provides raw, value-added, and custom-blended products to the glass, construction, ceramics, foundry, coatings, polymers, sports and recreation, filtration and various other industries, primarily in North America.  The Industrial segment represented approximately 40% of total revenues for 2018.
 We believe our segments are complementary.  Our ability to sell to a wide range of customers across multiple end markets allows us to maximize the recovery of our reserve base within our mining operations and to mitigate the cyclicality of our earnings.

 The Merger
 On June 1, 2018 (“Merger Date”), Unimin completed a business combination (“Merger”) whereby Fairmount Santrol merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unimin and ceased to exist as a separate corporate entity.  Immediately following the consummation of the Merger, Unimin changed its name to Covia Holdings Corporation and began operating under that name.  The common stock of Fairmount Santrol was delisted from the NYSE prior to the market opening on June 1, 2018, and Covia commenced trading under the ticker symbol “CVIA” on that date.  Upon the consummation of the Merger, the former stockholders of Fairmount Santrol (including holders of certain Fairmount Santrol equity awards) received, in the aggregate, $170 million in cash consideration and approximately 35% of the common stock of Covia.  Approximately 65% of the outstanding shares of Covia common stock was owned by SCR-Sibelco NV (“Sibelco”), previously the parent company of Unimin, as of December 31, 2018.
 In connection with the Merger, we redeemed approximately 18.5 million shares of Unimin common stock from Sibelco in exchange for an amount in cash equal to approximately (i) $660 million plus interest accruing at 5.0% per annum for the period from September 30, 2017 through June 1, 2018 less (ii) $170 million in cash paid to Fairmount Santrol stockholders.

In connection with the Merger, we also completed a debt refinancing transaction, with Barclays Bank PLC as administrative agent, by entering into a $1.65 billion senior secured term loan (“Term Loan”) and a $200 million revolving credit facility (“Revolver”).  The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to repay the indebtedness of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol and to pay the cash portion of the Merger consideration and expenses related to the Merger.
 As a condition to the Merger, Unimin contributed assets of its Electronics segment, including $31.0 million of cash to Sibelco North America, Inc. (“HPQ Co.”), a newly-formed wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin, in exchange for all of the stock of HPQ Co. and the assumption by HPQ Co. of certain liabilities.  Unimin distributed all of the stock of HPQ Co. to Sibelco in exchange for 170 shares (or 15,097 shares subsequent to the stock split, see Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements) of Unimin common stock held by Sibelco.
 Costs and expenses incurred related to the Merger are recorded in Other non-operating expense, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and include legal, accounting, valuation and financial advisory services, integration and other costs totaling $51.1 million and $19.3 million for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Unimin was determined to be the acquirer in the Merger for accounting purposes, and the historical financial statements and the historical amounts included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to Unimin.  The Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes the results of Fairmount Santrol from the Merger Date.  The Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 reflects Covia; however, the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017 reflects Unimin only.  The presentation of information for periods prior to the Merger Date are not fully comparable to the presentation of information for periods presented after the Merger Date because the results of operations for Fairmount Santrol are not included in such information prior to the Merger Date.
 Discontinued Operations
 On May 31, 2018, prior to and as a condition to the closing of the Merger, Unimin contributed certain assets, comprising its global high purity quartz business in exchange for all of the stock of HPQ Co. and the assumption by HPQ Co. of certain liabilities.  Unimin distributed 100% of the stock of HPQ Co. to Sibelco in exchange for certain shares of Unimin common stock held by Sibelco.  HPQ Co. is presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.
 As part of the disposition of HPQ Co., Covia and HPQ Co. entered into an agreement detailing tax-related matters governing their respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations relating to tax liabilities, the filing of tax returns, the control of tax contests, and other tax matters (the “Tax Matters Agreement”).  Under the Tax Matters Agreement, Covia and HPQ Co. (and their affiliates) are responsible for income taxes required to be reported on their respective separate and group tax returns; however, HPQ Co. is responsible for any unpaid income taxes attributable to the HPQ Co. business prior to May 31, 2018, as well as any unpaid non-income taxes as of May 31, 2018 attributable to the HPQ Co. business (whether arising prior to May 31, 2018 or not).  Covia is responsible for all other non-income taxes.  Covia and HPQ Co. will equally bear any transfer taxes imposed in this transaction.  Rights to refunds in respect of taxes will be allocated in the same manner as the responsibility for tax liabilities.
 Foreign Operations
 We operate facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, China and Denmark and sell products in North America and to several countries around the world.  Although our sales are geographically diverse, with significant sales in Mexico, particularly in the glass and ceramics industries, none of our segments are solely dependent upon foreign operations.  Our international operations are subject to various risks attendant to doing business abroad.  For a discussion of these risks, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Report.  For additional information about our operations outside of the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, see Note 23 in our consolidated financial statements in this Report.  
Seasonality
 Our business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations that impact our production levels and our customers’ business needs.  For example, demand for many of the products we sell in the construction and coatings sectors tends to correlate with construction activity, which is lowest in the fourth quarter.  Additional volumes sold into the Energy markets tend to be slower in the first and fourth quarter compared to the second and third quarter.  Inclement weather may also cause temporary slowdowns for our customers, 
 5


which may impact our sales volumes.  A majority of our facilities are all-weather facilities capable of providing a consistent supply source to customers.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 3,384 employees.  We believe that we maintain good relations with our workforce and maintain an active dialogue with employees.  We provide salaried and hourly employees a comprehensive benefits package, including medical, life and accident insurance, incentive bonus programs and a 401(k) plan with an employer match and discretionary employer contribution, company pension (for certain employees) as well as various employee training and development programs that have been developed internally or through a third party.
 As of December 31, 2018, approximately 34% of our employees were parties to collective bargaining contracts.  We believe we have strong relationships with and maintain an active dialogue with union representatives.  We have historically been able to successfully extend and renegotiate collective bargaining agreements as they expire.  We have not experienced a significant work stoppage or strike at any of our facilities in nearly 20 years.
 Energy Segment Overview
 Advances in oil and gas extraction techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have allowed for significantly greater extraction of oil and gas trapped within shale formations.  The hydraulic fracturing process consists of pumping fluids down a well at pressures sufficient to create fractures in the targeted hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation in order to increase the flow rate of hydrocarbons from the well.  A granular material, called proppant, is suspended and transported in the fluid and fills the fracture, “propping” it open once high-pressure pumping stops.  The proppant-filled fracture creates a conductive channel through which the hydrocarbons may flow more freely from the formation into the wellbore and then to the surface.  Proppants therefore perform the vital function of promoting the flow, or conductivity, of hydrocarbons over the productive life of a well.  In fracturing a well, operators select a proppant that is transportable into the fracture, is compatible with frac and wellbore fluids, permits acceptable cleanup of frac fluids and can resist proppant flowback.  In addition, the proppant must be resistant to crushing under the earth’s closure stress and reservoir temperature.  Our Energy segment serves customers in the oil and gas industry, providing a variety of proppants and other oilfield minerals for use in hydraulic fracturing in, primarily, the U.S. and Canada.  The oil and natural gas proppant industry is comprised of businesses involved in the mining or manufacturing, distribution and sale of the propping agents used in hydraulic fracturing, the most widely used method for stimulating increased production from lower permeability oil and natural gas reservoirs.  
Frac Sand Extraction, Processing, and Distribution
 Raw frac sand is a naturally occurring mineral that is mined and processed.  While the specific extraction method utilized depends primarily on the geologic conditions, most raw frac sand is mined using conventional open-pit extraction methods.  The composition, depth, and chemical purity of the sand also dictate the processing method and equipment utilized.  After extraction, raw frac sand is washed with water to remove fine impurities such as clay and organic particles, with additional procedures used when contaminants are not easily removable.  The final steps in the production process involve the drying and screening of the raw frac sand according to mesh size.
 Most frac sand is shipped in bulk from the processing facility to customers by truck, rail or barge.  Because transportation costs may represent a significant portion of the overall delivered product cost, shipping in large quantities, particularly when shipping over long distances, provides a significant cost advantage to the suppliers, which highlights the importance of rail or barge access for low cost delivery.  As a result, facility location and logistics capabilities are an important consideration for suppliers and customers.  
 Energy Proppant Market
 There are three primary types of proppant that are utilized in the hydraulic fracturing process: raw frac sand, coated sand and manufactured ceramic beads.  Customers choose among these proppant types based on the geology of the reservoir, expected well pressures, proppant flowback concerns, and product cost.  Given the price differences between the various proppant products and well-specific considerations, oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) and oilfield service (“OFS”) companies are continually evaluating the cost and conductivity of the various proppants in order to best address the geology of the well and to maximize well productivity and economic returns.

Energy Proppant Trends
 Demand for proppant is significantly influenced by the level of drilling and well completions by E&P and OFS companies, which depends largely on the current and anticipated profitability of developing oil and natural gas reserves.  Drilling and completions activity increased substantially in the first half of 2018 as a result of rising oil prices, but declined in the second half of 2018 relative to the first half of the year as a result of operator budgetary constraints and lower oil prices.  West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil prices averaged nearly $65 per barrel in 2018 versus $51 per barrel in 2017.  However, the WTI benchmark was approximately $45 per barrel at the end of 2018 and was approximately $58 per barrel as of March 15, 2019.
 Proppant supply grew throughout 2018, particularly as a result of the opening of new “local” plants in the Permian and Mid-Con basins.  The geology of local supply differs from Northern White Sand with lower crush strength, less sphericity and less roundness, however this proppant may be fit for purpose in certain well applications, and given their lower costs, demand for these products has strengthened considerably.  Most local plants were developed to supply local basins in which they are located and lack the logistical infrastructure to economically ship product to other basins. We have commissioned two new facilitate in Crane and Kermit, Texas in the Permian in the third quarter 2018, each with three million tons of annual production capacity, and a two million ton annual production capacity facility in Seiling, Oklahoma in the Mid-Con basin in the fourth quarter 2018.
 As a result of these new sources of supply and sequentially slower proppant demand in the second half of 2018, supply for proppants exceeded demand in the second half of 2018, resulting in significantly lower proppant pricing.  This trend is expected to continue in 2019 as additional new supply enters the marketplace, particularly in West Texas, South Texas and Oklahoma.
 In response to changing market demands, through March 2019, we idled operations at mines in Shakopee, Minnesota, Brewer, Missouri, Voca, Texas and Wexford, Michigan and at our resin coating facility in Cutler, Missouri.  Additionally, we have reduced production capacity at certain of our Northern White sand plants.  In total, we have reduced our Energy segment nameplate annual capacity by 6.9 million tons through these capacity reduction measures allowing us to lower fixed plant costs and consolidate volumes into lower cost operations.  
 Our Energy Products 
 We offer a broad suite of proppant products designed to address nearly all well environments and related down-hole challenges faced by our customers.  Revenues in our Energy segment are generally derived from the sale of raw sand plus the sale of certain value-added products.  
 Northern White Frac Sand.  Our Northern White frac sand is produced from geologically mature quartz arenite sands mined from deposits located primarily in the northern half of the U.S.  These reserves are generally characterized by high purity, structural integrity, significant roundness and sphericity, and low turbidity.  All of our Northern White frac sand proppant products meet API standards.
 In-Basin “Local” Frac Sand.  Our in-basin “local” reserves are located in West Texas and Oklahoma.  Our local frac sand has less crush strength, less sphericity, and lower silica content relative to our Northern White products, and is suitable in certain well environments.  These reserves are in close proximity to the Permian and Mid-Continental basins, which provides them with a significant transportation cost advantage relative to Northern White frac sand sourced from more distant locations.
 Value-Added Products.  We coat a portion of our sand with resin to enhance certain performance characteristics as a proppant using proprietary resin formulations and coating technologies.  Our value-added proppants are generally used in higher temperature and higher pressure well environments and are marketed to end users who require increased conductivity in higher pressure wells, high crush resistance, and/or enhanced flow back control in order to enhance the productivity of their wells.
 Our resin coated sand products are sold as both tempered (or pre-cured) and curable (or bonding) products.  Curable coated sand bonds down hole as the formation heat causes neighboring coated sand grains to polymerize with one another locking proppant into place.  This mitigates the risk of proppant from flowing back out of the fracture when the oil or natural gas well commences production.  For certain resin products, the resin’s chemical properties are triggered by the introduction of an activator into the frac fluid.  We formulate, manufacture, and sell activators, which work with the specific chemistry of our resins.  Tempered products do not require activation because they are not intended to bond, rather they are designed to bring additional strength to the proppant.

Our patented Propel SSP® product utilizes a polymer coating applied to a proppant substrate.  Upon contact with water, the coating hydrates and swells to create a hydrogel around the proppant substrate.  The hydrogel layer, which is primarily water, is attached to the proppant particle and provides an increase in the hydrostatic radius of the proppant.  
 Our DST™ Dust Suppression Technology is a coating applied to sand, which results in reduced respirable crystalline silica exposure (RCS).  Tests have shown that using DST can reduce average RCS by over 95% when compared to untreated sand.  DST was developed to help customers reduce worker exposure to RCS and comply with new OSHA standards.
 Our silica-based well cementing additives keep cement strong, bonding cement together even under acidic conditions, and prevent strength retrogression in well temperatures greater than 230°F.  We market these additives as SilverBond®.
 Our silica-based gravel packing sands are high quality monocrystalline and prevent the production of reservoir sands while still producing hydrocarbons.  We market these sands as Accupack®.
 Industrial Segment Overview
 Our Industrial segment sells products to the glass, ceramics, construction, coatings, polymers, foundry and various other industries.  Our sales to these industries correlate strongly with overall economic activity levels as reflected in the gross domestic product, vehicle production and growth in the housing market.  We believe that overall activity across our Industrial segment remains solid with certain sectors providing above-GDP level growth due to consumer, regulatory and/or manufacturing trends.
Industrial Markets and Products
 Glass.  The glass market includes four primary sub-markets: container glass; flat glass; fiberglass; and specialty display glass.
 The main products we supply for container glass production are whole grain silica, feldspar and nepheline syenite.  Container glass is primarily comprised of bottles and demand in the U.S. tends to follow U.S. gross domestic product growth and has driven stable volumes for suppliers of silica, feldspar and nepheline syenite.  In Mexico, growth in the worldwide consumption of beer produced and bottled in Mexico has increased the demand by Mexican breweries for glass bottles, which has increased demand for high-quality low-iron silica sand.
 The flat glass sub-market is primarily comprised of automotive glass and windows for both residential and commercial applications.  The main product we supply into the flat glass industry is whole grain silica.
 The fiberglass sub-market produces fine filament fiber used in fiberglass reinforced plastic, which is used in boats, automobiles and other industrial applications as well as the production of fiberglass for home and business insulation.  The main products we supply to the fiberglass industry include ground silica and fiberglass grade kaolin.
 We offer one of the largest multi-facility and multi-product mineral portfolios serving the North American glass market.  We believe that our longstanding customer relationships and reputation for quality provide us a competitive advantage.  We also have a broad-based multi-facility capability that is able to service large multi-plant glass customers.  Our primary product for sale to the glass market is produced from high silica content sand deposits throughout North America, however we also supply the glass industry with nepheline syenite and other mineral additives.  Glass batch formulations determine the raw material requirements of the glass manufacturer and differ based upon the requirements of the end-use product.
 Ceramics.  The ceramics manufacturing market includes a diverse mix of products.  Among the main types of ceramics produced are sanitaryware (e.g., toilets, wash basins, pedestals, bidets, urinals, sinks and bathtubs), clay brick and tiles (frequently used in residential construction).  Sanitaryware is made primarily with clay (ball clay or China clay), quartz and feldspar.  The majority of sanitaryware sold in the U.S. is produced in Mexico, while the ceramic tile industry has continued to grow as Italian manufacturers have established production facilities in the U.S.

We supply the ceramics market with nepheline syenite, granular silica, potassium feldspar, pressing clays, ceramic casting clays, refractory grade clays, plastic forming clays and sodium feldspar.  Additionally, we distribute Ukrainian ball clay, potassium feldspar from India and French pebbles used as grinding media.  These products are used in the production of white wares (tableware and/or sanitary ware) and tiles.  We believe that our low cost production and geographic proximity to many of our customers, combined with a broad product offering, are major factors contributing to our successful position in the ceramics market.
 Construction.  The construction market, driven by urbanization, new home construction, remodeling and repair, and commercial buildings, drives demand for many of our products.  Customers in the construction market seek suppliers who can offer multi-product mineral offerings, multi-plant production capabilities, diversified and low-cost logistics solutions and superior customer and technical service.  Understanding the features of our products and the benefits they deliver to our customers’ processes and products are key characteristics that have made us a leading minerals supplier to the construction market.  Customers also seek reliable and consistent suppliers of minerals, which vary by size, shape, chemistry or other physical characteristics.  We believe we are well-situated to serve customers in the construction industry due to our mine locations and manufacturing footprint, which we believe provide broad geographic coverage and access to customers either by truck or rail.
 Coatings.  The architectural and industrial coatings market includes coatings and specialty materials for customers in a wide array of end uses, including industrial equipment and components, packaging material, aircraft and marine equipment and automotive original equipment.  Paint and coatings manufacturers also serve commercial and residential new build and maintenance customers by supplying coatings to painting and maintenance contractors and directly to consumers for decoration and maintenance.  The architectural coatings industry is highly competitive and consists of several large firms with global presence and many smaller firms serving local or regional customers.  Price, product performance, technology, cost effectiveness, quality and technical and customer service are major competitive factors in the industrial, automotive OEM, packaging coatings and coatings services businesses.  Our coatings products in North America include nepheline syenite, microcrystalline silica, kaolin and silica.
 Polymers.  Polymers are chemical compounds or a mixture of compounds formed by polymerization and consisting essentially of repeating structural units.  Because of their low density and their ability to be shaped and molded at relatively low temperatures compared to traditional materials such as metals, polymers are widely used across several industrial markets.  Parts and components that have traditionally been made of wood, metal, ceramic or glass are now being redesigned with polymers.
 Packaging, construction, transportation and electrical & electronic (“E&E”) are the four largest polymer sub-markets.  While packaging is the largest application in terms of volume, applications such as construction, transportation and E&E offer more value with intense use of additives and fillers.
 The usage of our products, particularly nepheline syenite, in polymer markets has been growing due to a number of factors, including an expanded customer base as a result of approval of food-contact applications by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and development of new products in composites, color concentrates and building and construction products (window and door frames, vinyl sidings and fencing).  Our products for the polymers market include nepheline syenite, calcium carbonate, crystalline silica and kaolin.
 Foundry and Metallurgical.  We currently supply the foundry market with multiple grades of sands for molding and core-making applications, with products sold primarily in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, and China.  Foundry sands are characterized by high purity, round and sub-angular sands precisely screened to perform under a variety of metal casting conditions.  These factors dictate the refractory level and physical characteristics of the mold and core, which have a significant effect on the quality of the castings produced in the foundry.  We also supply resin binders which provide the necessary bonding of molds and cores in casting applications and are designed to improve overall productivity and environment conditions in the workplace.  We supply foundries with metallurgical consumables, which are required by all metal refining and casting operations.  Our quicklime additions are an essential component in the refining process to control slag chemistry and protect and extend furnace refractory life.
 Our silica sand foundry activities are typically local by nature and developed in conjunction with other industries to maximize productivity and profitability of existing assets.  Foundry sand availability in North America is strongly influenced by heavy industries, including glass, automotive, equipment and oil and gas.  We serve the foundry market through multiple product offerings, including our silica, resin coated sand, Alpha Resin Systems, lime, and refractory grade clays.
 Sports and Recreation.  We are a leading supplier of various turf and landscape infill products to contractors, municipalities, nurseries, and mass merchandisers.  Our turf-related products are used in multiple major sporting facilities, including First Energy Stadium and Progressive Field in Ohio, PNC Park in Pennsylvania, Notre Dame Stadium in Indiana, and ADPRO Sports Training Center 
 9


Fieldhouse in New York.  In addition, we are a significant supplier of bunker sand, top dressing sands, and all-purpose sands to golf courses and landscape contractors throughout North America.  Our sands are also supplied to horse tracks and training facilities.  We also provide colored sand to a variety of major retailers for use as play sand and arts and crafts.
 Other Industrial Applications.  We market a diverse mineral portfolio for an equally diverse group of industrial and commercial applications, including water filtration and treatment, soil stabilization and neutralization applications.
Product Delivery
 Among the most important purchasing criteria of our customers is the ability to deliver products upon demand at the desired time and location at the lowest possible cost.  We have a comprehensive and diversified supply chain network, which we believe provides us a competitive advantage. In 2018, we shipped products via rail, barge and truck to approximately 2,000 customers in North America.  Our size and scale provide broad supply chain flexibility, which we optimize on a weekly basis using leading technology.  Our logistics network includes distribution terminals in all major oil and gas basins, as well as selected locations to serve Industrial customers.  We serve these locations with a fleet of approximately 20,200 railcars (which includes approximately 4,000 customer railcars).
 Many of our facilities are situated on five Class 1 railroads providing direct service to every major oil and gas basin in the U.S. as well as transport significant industrial volumes longer distances to customers.  We also own and operate the Winchester & Western railroad, a private railroad in New Jersey, West Virginia, Virginia and Maryland.  We use the Winchester & Western railroad to move minerals from our Dividing Creek and Gore facilities to customers via access to the Norfolk Southern and CSX railroads.
 We believe that our private rail fleet enables us to maximize efficiency and reduce costs in our supply chain.  We are one of the few North American mineral producers capable of Class 1 railroad deliveries in each of North America’s major oil and gas producing basins.  We generally ship products to either a customer-owned terminal location or a Covia owned or operated terminal, where products are stored until provided to a customer, or to one of our processing facilities for value-added processing.  The direct rail access of our processing and distribution facilities significantly reduces handling costs and lead-times while enhancing production throughput, resulting in improved responsiveness to our customers.
 Last Mile Logistics Solutions.  In response to requests from some customers we have recently entered into partnerships with last mile logistics (LML) providers to offer this service.  Through these partnerships, we lease systems from these LML providers, and then offer our customers an integrated mine to well site solution.  The partnerships also allow us to offer multiple LML options to our customers, such as silos or boxes, based on their preferences.
 In selecting LML partners, we have focused on those that can provide high volume of proppant per truck load, minimized well pad footprint, fast unloading times and strong safety records.
 Raw Materials
 Our products depend on the availability of certain raw materials, including natural gas or propane, resins and additives, bagging supplies, and other raw materials.  These raw materials are readily available from a variety of sources and we are not dependent on any one supplier of raw materials.  See “Part I, Item 2 – Properties” of this Report for additional information regarding the sources of our mineral products.
Our Customers
 Our strategy has been to partner with the largest and most advanced companies in the markets they serve.  The strength of our customer base is driven by our collaborative approach to product innovation and development, reputation for high quality, the consistency and reliability of our products and the scale of our operations and logistics network.  We currently serve approximately 2,000 customers across a variety of industries in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and the rest of the world.  A significant portion of our sales by volume is derived from customers with whom we have long-term relationships.  In the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, one customer exceeded 10% of our revenues.  This customer accounted for 13% of our revenues in each of 2018 and 2017.  A large portion of our Energy segment sales are generated by a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in purchases by, our largest customers could adversely affect our operations. Top customers may not continue to purchase the same levels of product in the future due to a variety of reasons, notwithstanding any contract requirements.
 10


We primarily sell products under supply agreements with terms that vary by customer.  Certain of our supply agreements require the customer to purchase a specified percentage of its product requirements from us.  Other agreements require the customer to purchase a minimum volume from us.  These minimum volume contracts often require the customer to pay us specified amounts if the purchased volume does not meet the required minimums.  Specific custom orders are generally filled upon request, and backlog is not a material factor.
 Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property consists primarily of patents, trade secrets, know-how, and trademarks.  Our trademarks include, but are not limited to, our name Covia™ and products such as Unifrac®, Minex®, Glassil®, Propstar®, Imsil®, Granusil®, Puresil®, PowerProp®, Propel SSP®, HyperProp®, and CoolSet®.  We hold numerous U.S. and foreign-granted patents that are still in force as well as many U.S. and foreign patent applications that are pending.  The majority of our patents have an expiration date after 2025.  Since 2016, we received several patents on Propel SSP® proppant technology and have additional patents pending.  
 We believe that our extensive experience, trade secrets and know-how with a variety of different products enables us to offer our customers a wide range of proppants for their particular application.  We operate laboratories in the U.S. and Mexico, which provide mineral processing, analytics and materials research for product and application development across the oil and gas, glass, ceramics, coatings and polymers industries.  Staffing across these laboratories comprises professionals in analytical chemistry, mineral processing, mineralogy, inorganic chemistry, material science, coatings science, polymer science and related fields.  We also employ technical sales personnel covering our core target industries.
 Competition
 In our Energy segment, we compete with numerous large and small producers in all of the sand producing regions of North America.  Our main competitors in the raw frac sand industry include Badger Mining Corporation (which owns Atlas Resin Proppants LLC), CARBO Ceramics, Inc., Emerge Energy Services LP, Hi-Crush Partners LP, Preferred Sands LLC, Smart Sand Inc., Superior Silica and U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc.  Our main competitors in the coated products industry include Atlas Resin Proppants LLC, CARBO Ceramics, Inc., Momentive Performance Materials Inc., Preferred Sands LLC, Vista Sands and U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc.  Beyond these competitors, there are a number of other competitors who operate production facilities and compete in the oil and gas industry.  With the emergence of local sand, we have concentrated competition in West Texas, which has resulted in new competitors emerging, including Alpine Silica, Black Mountain Silica and High Roller in addition to competitors from our existing products.  The most important competitive factors in our Energy segment are product quality, performance, sand and proppant characteristics, transportation capabilities, proximity of supply to well site, reliability of supply, price and customer relationships.  
 In our Industrial segment, we compete with large diversified companies but also with smaller, local or regional producers on product quality, product consistency and reliably delivering products at a competitive price.  Competitors may produce minerals similar to those sold by us or they may produce substitute products that offer similar functionality.

 Regulation and Legislation
 Mining and Workplace Safety
 Federal Regulation
 MSHA is the primary regulatory organization governing the commercial silica industry.  Accordingly, MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines, and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with quarries and mines.  The mission of MSHA is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and to enforce compliance with mandatory safety and health standards.  MSHA works closely with the Industrial Minerals Association, a trade association, in pursuing this mission.  As part of MSHA’s oversight, representatives perform at least two unannounced inspections annually for each above-ground facility.  To date these inspections have not resulted in any citations for material violations of MSHA standards.

We also are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers.  In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.  OSHA regulates users of commercial silica and provides detailed regulations requiring employers to protect employees from overexposure to silica through the enforcement of permissible exposure limits.
 We adhere to a strict occupational health program aimed at controlling exposure to silica dust, which includes dust sampling, a respiratory protection program, medical surveillance, training, and other components.  Our safety program is designed to ensure compliance with the standards of our Occupational Health and Safety Manual and MSHA regulations.  For both health and safety issues, extensive training is provided to employees.  We have safety committees at our plants made up of salaried and hourly employees.  We perform annual internal health and safety audits and conduct annual crisis management drills to test our plants’ abilities to respond to various situations.  Health and safety programs are administered by our corporate health and safety department with the assistance of plant local environmental, health and safety coordinators.
 Environmental Matters
 We and our competitors are subject to extensive governmental regulation on, among other things, matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, and environmental contamination and reclamation.  A variety of federal, state, and local agencies implement and enforce these regulations.
Federal Regulation
 At the federal level, we may be required to obtain permits under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., including wetlands and streams, in connection with our operations.  We also may be required to obtain permits under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act from the EPA (or the relevant state environmental agency in states where the permit program has been delegated to the state) for discharges of pollutants into waters of the U.S., including discharges of wastewater or storm water runoff associated with construction activities.  Failure to obtain these required permits or to comply with their terms could subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief.
 The U.S. Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements, such as monitoring and reporting requirements.  These regulatory programs may require us to install expensive emissions abatement equipment, modify our operational practices and obtain permits for our existing operations, and before commencing construction on a new or modified source of air emissions, such laws may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities extended to produce or significantly increase air emissions.  In addition, air permits are required for our processing and terminal operations, and our frac sand mining operations that result in the emission of regulated air contaminants.  Obtaining air emissions permits has the potential to delay the development or continued performance of our operations.  As a result, we may be required to incur increased capital and operating costs because of these regulations.  We could be subject to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and comparable state laws and regulations.
 Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”).  In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs.  
 Independent of the U.S. Congress, the EPA has adopted regulations controlling GHG emissions under its existing authority under the CAA.  In 2009, the EPA officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes.  These findings by the EPA allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA.  In 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding its existing GHG emissions reporting rule for certain petroleum and natural gas facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.  We are subject to annual GHG reporting obligations for our operations in Wedron, Illinois, Calera, Alabama and Ontario, Canada locations.
 Although it is not currently possible to predict how any proposed or future GHG legislation or regulation by the U.S. Congress, the EPA, the states, or multi-state regions will impact our business, any legislation or regulation of GHG emissions that may be imposed

in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 As part of our operations, we utilize or store petroleum products and other substances such as diesel fuel, lubricating oils, and hydraulic fluid.  We are subject to regulatory programs pertaining to the storage, use, transportation, and disposal of these substances, including Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure planning requirements.  Spills or releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including those relating to claims for damage or injury to property and persons.  Additionally, some of our operations are located on properties that historically have been used in ways that resulted in the release of contaminants, including hazardous substances, into the environment, and we could be held liable for the remediation of such historical contamination.  CERCLA and comparable state laws impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site.  Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies.  In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
 In the course of our operations, we generate industrial solid wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes.  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes.  The EPA and the individual states, to which the EPA has delegated portions of the RCRA program for local implementation, administer the RCRA program.
 In September 2013, the EPA issued RCRA consent orders to several companies, including us, in connection with historic contamination of residential drinking water wells near our Wedron, Illinois facility.  The EPA identified benzene and other volatile organic compounds in some drinking water wells, some (including benzene) in excess of established standards.  The consent orders required the companies to analyze conditions at their sites to determine whether operations at their sites are potential sources of groundwater contamination.  We completed the study for our site, and our consultant submitted a site conditions report to the EPA in August 2014, which report concluded that our operations at the site are not a source of groundwater impacts in the Wedron community.  The report recommended that no further work should be required under the consent order.  In March 2015, the EPA issued a letter to us stating that we have completed all work required under the consent order to the EPA’s satisfaction, and our obligations under the consent order have now been satisfied.  We have also performed environmental investigation and remediation activities under oversight of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) at a removed underground storage tank (UST) system at the Wedron facility south of residential areas of the community.  The investigation report approved by the IEPA concluded that the petroleum constituents reported in the groundwater in the Wedron community are not related to the former UST system.  We have performed limited soil removal at the location of the former UST system pursuant to a Corrective Action Plan approved by the IEPA.  The IEPA has approved the closure of this site, which is documented through a No Further Remediation Letter issued by the Agency.  The No Further Remediation Letter has been recorded with the local County Recorder of Deeds and includes deed restrictions which will limit this portion of the Wedron property to industrial use in perpetuity.

Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, we supply sand-based proppants to hydraulic fracturing operators in the oil and natural gas industry.  Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals, under pressure, into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.  The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state or local governmental authorities.  However, the practice of hydraulic fracturing has become controversial in some areas and is undergoing increased scrutiny.  Several federal agencies and regulatory authorities are investigating the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and whether additional regulation may be necessary.  The EPA has asserted limited federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing and has indicated it may seek to further expand its regulation of hydraulic fracturing.  The Bureau of Land Management has proposed regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing conducted on federal and Indian oil and gas leases.  The U.S. Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing.  In addition, various state, local, and foreign governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permitting requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas such as environmentally sensitive watersheds.  Numerous states have imposed disclosure requirements on hydraulic fracturing well owners and operators.  Some local governments have adopted and others may seek to adopt ordinances prohibiting or regulating the time, place, and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities within their jurisdictions.
 The adoption of new laws, regulations, or enforcement policies at the federal, state, local, or foreign levels imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our customers’ costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our sand-based proppants.
 Our operations may also be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”).  NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all “major federal actions” significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.  The granting of a federal permit for a major development project, such as a mining operation, may be considered a “major federal action” that requires review under NEPA.  Therefore, our projects may require review and evaluation under NEPA.  As part of this evaluation, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among other things, impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife (including threatened and endangered species), historical and archeological resources, geology, socioeconomics and aesthetics.  NEPA also requires the consideration of alternatives to the project.  The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, can be time consuming and expensive.  The purpose of the NEPA review process is to inform federal agencies’ decision-making on whether federal approval should be granted for a project and to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of a proposed project.  Though NEPA requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not mandate a result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit, or impose certain conditions on its approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party may challenge the adequacy of a NEPA review and thereby delay the issuance of a federal permit or approval.
 Federal agencies granting permits for our operations also must consider impacts to endangered and threatened species and their habitat under the Endangered Species Act.  We also must comply with and are subject to liability under the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for the harming of endangered or threatened species and their habitat.  Some of our operations are conducted in areas where protected species or their habitats are known to exist.  In these areas, we may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse effects to protected species and their habitats, and we may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain times, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when our operations could have an adverse effect on the species.  Federal agencies also must consider a project’s impacts on historic or archeological resources under the National Historic Preservation Act, and we may be required to conduct archeological surveys of project sites and to avoid or preserve historical areas or artifacts.

State and Local Regulation
 Because our operations are located in numerous states, we are also subject to a variety of different state and local environmental review and permitting requirements.  Some states in which our projects are located or are being developed have state laws similar to NEPA; thus our development of new sites or the expansion of existing sites may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if it is not subject to NEPA.  In some cases, the state environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review.  Our operations may require state law-based permits in addition to federal or local permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations, and scenic areas.  Some states also have specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and states may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies.  The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building, and transportation requirements.
 Some local communities have expressed concern regarding silica sand mining operations.  These concerns have generally included exposure to ambient silica sand dust, truck traffic, water usage, and blasting.  In response, certain state and local communities have developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize dust from getting airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly curtail the amount of practicable area for mining activities, require compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining activities and, in some cases, ban issuance of new permits for mining activities.  To date, we have not experienced any material impact to our existing mining operations or planned capacity expansions as a result of these types of concerns.  
 Planned expansion of our mining and production capacity or construction and operation of related facilities in new communities could be more significantly impacted by increased regulatory activity.  Difficulty or delays in obtaining or inability to obtain new mining permits or increased costs of compliance with future state and local regulatory requirements could have a material negative impact on our ability to grow our business.  In an effort to minimize these risks, we continue to be engaged with local communities in order to grow and maintain strong relationships with residents and regulators.
 Costs of Compliance
 We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health, and safety requirements applicable to our activities.  Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory, cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations, and the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations.  Compliance with these laws and regulations may also increase the cost of the development, construction and operation of our projects and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given project.  In addition, claims for damages to persons or property may result from environmental and other impacts of our activities.  In addition, the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, these laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly pollution control equipment, waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
 The process for performing environmental impact studies and reviews for federal, state, and local permits for our operations involves a significant investment of time and monetary resources.  We cannot control the permit approval process.  We cannot predict whether all permits required for a given project will be granted or whether such permits will be the subject of significant opposition.  The denial of a permit essential to a project or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop a project.  Significant opposition by neighboring property owners, members of the public or other third parties, as well as any delay in the environmental review and permitting process, could impair or delay our ability to develop or expand a project.  Additionally, the passage of more stringent environmental laws could impair our ability to develop new operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
