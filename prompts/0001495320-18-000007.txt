Our Company
Vera Bradley is a leading designer of women’s handbags, luggage and travel items, fashion and home accessories, and unique gifts. Founded in 1982 by friends Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia R. Miller, the brand’s innovative designs, iconic patterns, and brilliant colors inspire and connect women across the country. 
Vera Bradley offers a multi-channel sales model, as well as a focus on service and a high level of customer engagement. The Company sells its products through two reportable segments: Direct and Indirect. The Direct business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products through the Company’s full-line and factory outlet stores in the United States, verabradley.com, the Company’s online outlet site, direct-to-consumer eBay sales, and the Company’s annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana. As of February 3, 2018, the Company operated 109 full-line stores and 51 factory outlet stores. The Indirect business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products to approximately 2,400 specialty retail locations, substantially all of which are located in the United States, as well as department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, third-party inventory liquidators, and sales generated through licensing agreements. For financial information about our reportable segments, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this report.
Our History
Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia Miller founded the Company in 1982 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, after recognizing a lack of stylish travel accessories in the market. Within weeks, the friends created Vera Bradley, named after Ms. Bradley Baekgaard’s mother, and began manufacturing and marketing their distinctive products. The founders, together with past and present members of the executive management team, have been instrumental in our growth and success. The following timeline sets forth a summary of significant milestones in Vera Bradley’s history by calendar year:

The passion for design and customer service established by our founders has driven our Company for over 30 years and remains the cornerstone of Vera Bradley today.

Ms. Miller retired in October 2012 as our National Spokesperson, but continues to serve on the Board of Directors along with Ms. Baekgaard.
Vision 20/20 Initiatives
During fiscal 2018, we launched “Vision 20/20” which is an aggressive plan to turnaround our business and restore brand and Company health over the next three years. Integrating our Vision 20/20 initiatives into our long-term strategic plan is expected to lay the foundation for growth, a more profitable future, and continued strong cash flows. 
The key focus of Vision 20/20 is moving to a significantly less clearance-driven business model combined with a meaningful reduction in SG&A expenses. To move to a significantly less clearance driven business model, we are focusing on three key product and pricing initiatives: reducing the amount of clearance merchandise offered, narrowing our current product offerings, and introducing tighter assortment guardrails.
We will significantly reduce the amount of clearance merchandise offered on verabradley.com and in our full-line stores. This will help to reset our customers’ pricing expectations and restore our full-price business. To reduce certain clearance sales from verabradley.com, we began the use of our online outlet site in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by conducting two flash sales.
We are focusing on our best categories and will narrow our current product offerings by eliminating unproductive or incongruent categories and SKUs from our assortments. We began to narrow our product offerings in fiscal 2018 and are discontinuing our fragrance and jewelry collections in spring of fiscal 2019.
We are building tighter assortment guardrails around introducing new categories, patterns, and pricing, assuring the right fit for our brand and that our products not only provide thoughtful solutions but also reflect our signature attributes of being comfortable, casual, and affordable. These initiatives should be reflected in our product by fall of fiscal 2019.
We expect these product and pricing initiatives to negatively affect revenues in fiscal 2019, but we believe these are the right actions to take for the future health of the business.
5

As we reduce revenues, we will also continue to reduce SG&A expenses. These SG&A expense reductions began in fiscal 2018 by right-sizing our corporate and retail store infrastructure to align with the size of our business. Additional initiatives to reduce SG&A expenses include continuing to identify corporate efficiencies, reducing our marketing expenses and optimizing return on marketing spending, and taking a more aggressive stance on reducing store operating expenses and closing underperforming stores. We are forecasting to close up to 45 additional full-line stores (approximately 15 per year) by the end of fiscal 2021, primarily as leases expire. We closed five underperforming full-line stores and one underperforming factory outlet store during fiscal 2018.
Growth Strategies
Our long-term vision is to build on the Company's rich heritage and establish Vera Bradley as a premium global lifestyle brand, expand our customer reach, and grow our customer connections. Our long-term strategic plan, integrated with Vision 20/20, is centered upon the three planks of product, distribution, and marketing.
We call our target aspirational customer the Day Maker. She is organized, thoughtful and, most of all, appreciates femininity and beauty - in color, print, and thoughtful details. We are focused on creating thoughtful solutions for the Day Maker and believe we have a great opportunity to attract more Day Makers to our brand through our product offerings, our distribution channels, and our marketing efforts.
Product.  We have identified four key businesses where we can offer the Day Maker thoughtful solutions that we believe will propel our future growth. We are optimizing our existing core portfolio by eliminating product categories and specific SKUs that are unproductive or incongruent, as well as expanding into relevant new categories that reflect our brand and signature attributes of comfortable, casual, and affordable. We will continue to use licenses and strategic partnerships as appropriate to expand our product categories.

• | Our Fashion Bag and Accessories business continues to be our largest opportunity and allows us to highlight our innovation, function, and fashion. Both patterns and solids are important in this category.


• | Travel remains a core differentiator for Vera Bradley and allows us to both embrace our heritage and to showcase newness and functionality with products like Lighten Up and our unique collapsible luggage.


• | Our Campus business including backpacks, has been successful, and we believe there are further opportunities to expand our Campus authority going forward.


• | We believe Home can continue to be a significant growth opportunity for Vera Bradley, with market attractiveness and a great brand fit. The Day Maker’s fashion statement is often her home. Licensing will continue to play a key role in the home area.

In each of these areas, fabric, pattern innovation, and newness remain critical in staying relevant. 
Distribution Channels. Vera Bradley products are available through our Direct channel including full-line and factory outlet stores, online through verabradley.com and our online outlet site, and our annual outlet sale, as well as through the Indirect channel including department and specialty retail stores, national accounts, third-party e-commerce sites, and third-party inventory liquidators. We continue to focus on tightly integrating our multi-channel business by strengthening and right-sizing both our Direct and Indirect distribution channels. 
In 2007 and 2009, we opened our first full-line and factory outlet stores, respectively. We believe there continues to be long-term opportunities for new stores throughout the United States. We opened one new full-line pop-up store and six new factory outlet stores in fiscal 2018; however, we have slowed our short-term plans for new factory outlet store openings and suspended full-line store growth until we begin to produce comparable store sales growth. 
We closed five underperforming full-line stores in fiscal 2018 and expect to close up to 45 additional underperforming full-line stores by fiscal 2021, primarily as leases expire. During fiscal 2017 and 2018, we completed 34 full-line store renovations and updated the facade and exterior signage in an additional 14 full-line stores. These renovations were made to our continuing locations. Nearly 40 of our full-line stores reflect our new design aesthetic.
We plan to open six new factory outlet stores in fiscal 2019. At February 3, 2018, nearly 80% of the product in the outlet channel was made specifically for our factory outlet stores. This percentage is expected to increase in fiscal 2019.
In 2006, we began selling directly to consumers through verabradley.com. Building our digital flagship remains a key part of our distribution strategy. The redesign and conversion of our website to a new platform was completed in February 2017. This new platform offers enhanced ease of shopping and incremental functionality. This incremental functionality includes an upgraded mobile experience; additional navigation and search enhancements; improved product pages with enhanced imagery, product videos, and user-generated content; and new capabilities like eGift cards, “order on-line, pick up in store” and the 
6

GiftNow feature. The GiftNow feature allows customers to purchase gifts from verabradley.com that can be modified by the recipient before shipment. The new platform also gives us capabilities to create deeper customer relationships and create value through more personalization and strategic customization. As part of the Company's Vision 20/20 initiatives, we created an online outlet site during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to allow us to reduce clearance sales from verabradley.com. In fiscal 2018, we had over 46 million visits to our website and our online outlet site.
Our department store relationships allow us to expose our brand to new customers and showcase our new product assortments. We are currently in approximately 660 department store locations, including Dillard’s, Macy's, Bon-Ton, Belk, and Von Maur. In the department stores, we are continuing to work on enhancing our brand presentation and to explore expansion of our lifestyle brand offerings.
The specialty retail channel is the heritage of our business and remains important to us. We continue to add select accounts while discontinuing unproductive accounts. While the specialty retail business is becoming a smaller percentage of our total revenue base, we are working to stabilize it by assisting retailers with optimizing their businesses. 
We had a small wholesale presence in Japan during fiscal 2018 with a licensed partner but will be exiting Japan in mid fiscal 2019. We are exploring the possibility of expanding into other countries in the long-term but do not foresee any international country expansion in fiscal 2019.
Marketing. Marketing and brand positioning are both critical elements as we continue to engage new consumers and strengthen our bond with existing customers.
We activated our new branding and brand positioning in fiscal 2017, which included updating elements of our visual identity such as our logo and further evolving our marketing to speak more directly to the Day Maker. We increased our brand awareness in fiscal 2018 through our “digital first” strategy by partnering with key influencers and leveraging social media channels.
Well-timed and well-executed brand activation is critical to increasing our brand relevancy and increasing purchase intent.  Through comprehensive consumer research, we have designed a media plan that we believe effectively targets our Day Maker customers and attracts both lapsed and new Day Maker consumers to our brand. Our media efforts include a fully-integrated mix of digital, social, experiential, and print, with our goal being to surround the Day Maker with our brand. 
We reduced our marketing expenditures in fiscal 2018 by focusing on efficiencies and becoming more targeted while working to keep our most loyal customers engaged, as well as working to attract new consumers.
Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us within the marketplace:
Strong Brand Identity and Positioning. We believe the Vera Bradley brand is highly recognized for its distinctive and vibrant style. Vera Bradley is positioned in the market as a lifestyle brand that inspires consumers to express their femininity, individuality, and sense of style. We have also positioned our brand to highlight the high quality and functional attributes of our products. The Vera Bradley brand is more price accessible than many competing brands, which allows us to attract a wide range of consumers and increases our ability to achieve repeat purchases.
Customer Loyalty. We believe we have a segment of long-term consumers who act as loyal and enthusiastic brand advocates. We believe this enthusiasm for our brand by our loyal customers inspires repeat purchases. Our customers often purchase our products as gifts for family members and friends, who we strive to turn into brand enthusiasts. 
Product Development Expertise. Our product development team combines an understanding of consumer preferences with a knowledge of color, fashion, and style trends to design our products. Our creative design associates utilize a disciplined product design process that seeks to maximize the productivity of our product releases, including our print designs, and drive consumer demand.
Dynamic Multi-Channel Distribution Model. We offer our products through a diverse choice of shopping options across channels that are intimate, highly shop-able, fun, and characteristic of our brand. Whether they visit a Vera Bradley store, specialty retail store, department store, or verabradley.com, we believe consumers can find the brand in places that match their unique shopping interests. Our multi-channel distribution model enables us to maximize customer access to our products.

Unique Company Culture. We were founded in 1982 by two friends, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia Miller, who built our business around their passion for design and commitment to customer service. We believe our founders created a unique culture that attracts passionate and motivated employees who are excited about our products and our brand. Our employees share our founders’ commitment to Vera Bradley customers and to the Company’s core values of Kindness, Ingenuity, Thoughtfulness, Optimism, Tenacity, and Empathy. We believe that a fun, friendly, and welcoming work environment fosters creativity and collaboration. By empowering our employees to become personally involved in product design, testing, and marketing, they become passionate and devoted brand advocates.
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team, led by our Chief Executive Officer Robert Wallstrom, has extensive experience across a diverse range of disciplines in product design, merchandising, marketing, store operations and development, supply chain management, and finance. 
Our Product Release Strategy
We introduce new collections approximately ten times per year. Each launch typically consists of one to three signature cotton-quilted prints, as well as other fabrications including microfiber, leather, Lighten Up, and Midtown, many of which are also available in solid colors. These collections of prints and solids are incorporated into the designs of a wide range of products, including bags, accessories, and travel items. These collections typically include classic styles, updates to existing designs, and new product introductions.
To keep our assortment current and fresh, and to focus our inventory investments on our best performers, we discontinue prints and fabrications as necessary. We sell our remaining inventory of retired products primarily through our website (including our online outlet site), factory outlet stores, annual outlet sale, and third-party liquidators.
Our Products
The following chart presents net revenues generated by each of our four product categories and other revenues as a percentage of our total net revenues for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016.

Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %


(1) | Includes primarily apparel/footwear, stationery, freight, licensing, merchandising, and gift card breakage revenue.

Bags. Bags are a core part of our product offerings and are the primary component of every seasonal assortment. The category consists of classic and new styles developed by our product development team. Our bag product category includes items such as totes, crossbodies, satchels, clutches, backpacks, baby bags, and lunch bags. Bags play a prominent role in our visual merchandising, and we showcase the different fabrications, patterns, colors, and features of each bag.
Travel. Our travel product category includes rolling luggage, cosmetics, travel and packing accessories, and travel bags which includes our iconic duffel and weekend bags. The first Vera Bradley product offering included duffel bags, which have consistently have been strong performers. We believe their popularity, as well as the appeal of our other travel items, results from our vibrant designs, functional styles, and lightweight fabrications.
Accessories. Accessories include fashion accessories such as wallets, wristlets, eyeglass cases, scarves, and various technology accessories. Our accessories are attractively priced and allow the consumer to include some color in her wardrobe, even if tucked into another bag. Our product development team consistently updates the accessories assortment based on consumer demand and fashion trends.
Home. Our home category includes textiles, including throw blankets, beach towels, and comforters, as well as items such as mugs and tumblers.

Product Development
We have implemented a fully integrated and cross-functional product development process that aligns design, trend and market research, merchandising, planning, sales, marketing, and sourcing. Product development is a core capability that makes our products unique. Our designs and aesthetics set our products apart and drive customer loyalty. Our design and product development teams combine an understanding of the needs of our target Day Maker customers, with knowledge of upcoming color and fashion trends, to design new collections, as well as new product categories, that will resonate in the market.
We typically begin the development stage of our products in the Vera Bradley portfolio twelve to eighteen months in advance of their release. The development of each new pattern includes the design of a primary, secondary, and sometimes a tertiary print. To seek fresh perspectives, we often collaborate with independent designers to create unique patterns for each season and also maintain an internal print design team. We oversee the development and exercise the final approval of all patterns and designs. Once developed, we generally copyright our patterns as appropriate. We believe that great design is not only central to our product, but also is a fundamental part of our brand development and growth strategies.
Our product development team works to ensure that new collections contain an assortment of products and styles that are in line with both fashion trends and Day Maker customer needs and regularly updates classic styles to enhance functionality. In addition, we actively pursue opportunities to expand our product offerings through new line and brand extensions. Our product development team monitors fashion trends and customer needs by attending major trend shows in Europe and the United States, subscribing to trend monitoring services, and engaging in comparison-shopping.
Our product development team works closely with our marketing team to gather consumer insights through seasonal market research and in-store testing. We gather seasonal market research through a variety of methodologies, including scheduled interviews and online and in-person surveys conducted by our in-house team. The design and product development teams ensure that we offer products that are constructed to meet our standards of design, function, and quality in a cost-effective manner. We believe that with our cross-functional, collaborative approach, we are able to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly communicates the Vera Bradley brand.
In addition to products developed in-house, we also pursue brand extensions through strategic partnerships and licensing agreements. We currently have licenses in place for eyewear, collegiate, bedding, hosiery, swimwear, technology accessories, stationery, publishing, and health care uniform and accessories collections. We will continue to look for the right strategic partners and licensees that can augment the brand and provide established distribution networks for certain categories of business.
Marketing
We believe that the growth of our brand and our business is influenced by our ability to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly conveys the Vera Bradley brand personality. We use marketing as a critical tool in our efforts to promote our brand.
Retention Advertising. Vera Bradley communicates with our established customers consistently throughout the year with regular e-mails, social media, and seasonal direct mail catalogs, brochures, and notifications. Our retention advertising is geared to keeping Vera Bradley top of mind with our customers, rewarding our customers, and providing them with news of our seasonal launches and new product introductions. 
New Customer Acquisition Advertising. We primarily employ digital (i.e., display banner, mobile, geo-targeting, and pre-roll video) and print advertising to increase overall brand awareness and attract new customers. Our advertisements are placed in fashion, lifestyle, and family publications and websites that complement the wide breadth of appeal of our brand. Our ads have recently appeared in StyleWatch, InStyle, Glamour, Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Elle, and O the Oprah Magazine.
Public Relations and Product Placement. Vera Bradley has received considerable editorial exposure in the press, with mentions in O the Oprah Magazine, Good Housekeeping, Real Simple, Woman's Day, InStyle, Racked, and The Huffington Post. In addition, we have expanded our public relations efforts to reach popular online influencers and bloggers.
Product placement in feature-length films and on prime-time television shows remains strong with television placements in Life in Pieces, The Big Bang Theory, Blackish, Speechless, and American Housewife. Movie placements include: Pitch Perfect 3, La La Land, Girl's Trip, Baywatch, A Bad Moms Christmas, and Den of Thieves.
Partnerships. We work with high-profile partners to enhance our brand image and expand our customer reach. During fiscal 2017, we partnered with Madison Square Garden which, among other things, featured our new logo and video content. In fiscal 2018, we participated in a new six-episode reality competition television show called Girl Starter which aired on TLC 
9

beginning in early April. The show integrated our product and “It’s Good to be a Girl” marketing campaign clips. One episode featured a challenge in which our co-founder, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, was a guest judge.
Social Media and Online Marketing. We use online marketing and social networking sites as tools to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to verabradley.com and to our stores. We have captured approximately 4.6 million active customer e-mail addresses in our online customer file, with many of these customers providing age, occupation, and location data. This information provides us with deeper insight into the products and categories that are of the highest interest to our customers, and allows us to better target our customers with appropriate messages. As of February 3, 2018, we had approximately 1.8 million Facebook fans and approximately 84,000 Twitter followers. Our Instagram, which we launched in October 2012, has grown to approximately 330,000 followers and is our most highly engaged social medium. In addition, we often partner with brand-right bloggers to promote product.
Direct Mail. Seasonal Vera Bradley catalogs are a vehicle for promoting our brand and product portfolio. Each catalog is sent to a targeted customer mailing list. In addition to distributing the catalog, we produce and distribute a number of other marketing pieces, including postcards and mini-mailers. We believe our direct mail medium generates excitement and awareness about the brand and seasonal introductions and allows us to reach both new and loyal customers in their homes.
Seasonality
Because Vera Bradley products are frequently given as gifts, we have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. 
Channels of Distribution
We distribute our products through our Direct and Indirect segments. This multi-channel distribution model is designed to enable operational flexibility and maximizes the methods by which we can access potential customers.
Direct Segment
Full-Line Stores. We have developed a retail presence through our full-line stores, all located in the United States, which provides us with a format to showcase our brand and the full array of Vera Bradley products. As of February 3, 2018, we operated 109 full-line stores averaging approximately 1,900 square feet per store. In fiscal 2017, we opened our first flagship store in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City which offers customers a unique store experience, as well as exclusive product. Our sales associates are passionate about our products and customer service, which, we believe, translates into a superior shopping experience.
Factory Outlet Stores. Our factory outlet stores are a vehicle for selling factory exclusive styles, as well as retired merchandise at discounted prices, while maintaining brand integrity. At the end of fiscal 2018, nearly 80% of the merchandise found in our factory outlet stores was factory exclusive styles. We believe our factory outlet stores are an integral part of our distribution strategy, as this format provides an additional channel of distribution for our products and enables us to better target value-oriented customers. Our factory outlet stores average approximately 3,200 square feet per store. As of February 3, 2018, we operated 51 factory outlet stores, all located in the United States.
Store Location Selection Strategy. Our store location decisions for both full-line and factory outlet stores are made based upon our comprehensive retail strategy that includes actual and planned penetration in both Indirect and Direct segments, as well as existing e-commerce demand. At this time, we do not believe all geographical markets have been fully penetrated by our distribution channels. We believe that long-term expansion of our store base will increase brand awareness and reinforce our brand image. In addition to analyzing store economics, we pay particular attention to the location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies. Along with seeking co-tenants that we believe share our target customer, we seek a balanced mix of moderate and high-end retailers to encourage high levels of traffic. Our target full-line store size is approximately 1,800 square feet and our target factory outlet store size is approximately 3,000 square feet.
Store Operations. The focus of our store operations is providing consumers with a comfortable and memorable shopping experience. We strive to make the experience interactive through special store events, such as showcasing newly launched products or celebrating our namesake’s birthday. Our customer service philosophy emphasizes friendly service, merchandise knowledge, and passion for the brand. Consequently, an essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train, and retain talented, highly motivated district managers, store managers, and sales associates. 
10

Store Economics. We expect our full-line stores to average approximately 1,800 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
We expect our factory outlet stores to average approximately 3,000 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
E-Commerce. In 2006, we began selling our products through the verabradley.com website. The objective of verabradley.com is to provide both a mechanism for marketing directly to consumers and a storefront where consumers can find the entire full-line Vera Bradley collection. Since fiscal 2013, we have continually invested in upgrades to our website allowing for a more user-friendly homepage; enabling us to ship internationally; enhancing the checkout experience; adding product recommendations; enhancing product descriptions; adding silhouettes for product scale; generating cart and site abandonment emails; gathering and analyzing customer feedback; and enhancing our search capabilities. To continue to enhance our website engagement, we completed a redesign and conversion of our website to a new platform in February 2017. This new platform offers enhanced ease of shopping and incremental functionality including an upgraded mobile experience; additional navigation and search enhancements; improved product pages with enhanced imagery, product videos, and user-generated content; and new capabilities like the GiftNow feature, eGift cards, and “order on-line, pick up in store.” In addition, during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we created an online outlet site to reduce clearance sales from verabradley.com. We had over 46 million visits to verabradley.com and our online outlet site during fiscal 2018.
Annual Outlet Sale. Our annual outlet sale is held in the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum Exposition Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana each spring. The annual outlet sale is an important tradition for Vera Bradley, has many loyal followers, and is an opportunity for us to sell our retired merchandise at discounted prices in a brand-right fashion. We attracted approximately 46,000 attendees to our 2017 annual outlet sale.
Indirect Segment
As of February 3, 2018, we sold our products in approximately 2,400 specialty retail locations, as well as department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, third-party inventory liquidators, and through licensing agreements. In fiscal 2012, we launched our products in the department store channel. We are currently in approximately 660 department store locations, including approximately 260 Dillard's locations, approximately 240 Macy's, nearly 80 Bon-Ton, 45 Belk, and approximately 35 Von Maur locations. 
The top 30% of our specialty retailers account for approximately 70% of total specialty retailer revenue. No single Indirect retailer represented more than 10% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2018, with the top ten Indirect retailers representing in the aggregate approximately 40% of total Indirect net revenues. The majority of our Indirect retailers have been customers for over five years. 
Indirect Sales Force
We believe that having a combination of an in-house field sales force and a third-party agency, covering certain geographies, results in a more consistent brand presentation and messaging, enhanced support for our Indirect customers, and a more predictable, scalable, and cost-efficient business model. As of February 3, 2018, our in-house sales team consisted of approximately 25 full-time sales consultants. The compensation structure for our sales consultants consisted of a combination of fixed pay and sales-based incentives during fiscal 2018. Beginning in fiscal 2019, the compensation structure will be based upon a full commission model.
In addition to acquiring new and growing existing accounts, our sales consultants serve as a support center for our Indirect customers by assisting and educating them in areas such as merchandising and visual presentation, marketing the brand, product selection, and inventory management. Our visual merchandising program provides our sales consultants with a framework to guide our Indirect customers regarding optimal product placement and display that is intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinct from those of our competitors.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain Model
Our multi-country manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to achieve efficient, timely, and accurate order fulfillment while maintaining appropriate levels of inventory.
Our manufacturing and sourcing strategy is part of the larger cross-functional product development process. The overall objective for our sourcing team is to build and sustain collaborative partnerships throughout our supply chain, with a focus on identifying appropriate countries and partners to manufacture our products. The sourcing team leverages its expertise in negotiation, relationship management, and change management to maintain a strong global supply chain.
11

We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products. We have an active and nimble sales and operations planning process that helps us balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs. We have also integrated our planning, forecasting, and segmentation processes under one function called Merchandise Planning and Allocation.
Approximately half of our products are cotton-based. Our other fabrics include primarily nylon, polyester, microfiber, and leather. We source our materials from various suppliers in Asia, with the majority coming from China and South Korea. Our global sourcing team works with select suppliers enabling us to optimize the mix of cost, lead time, quality, and reliability within our global supply network. All of our suppliers must comply with our quality standards, and we use only a limited number of pre-approved suppliers who have demonstrated a commitment to delivering the highest quality products. In April 2016, we opened an office in Hong Kong to lead the global supply chain in Asia, including the oversight of sourcing and procurement.
The majority of our finished goods, not sourced through licenses or strategic partners, are manufactured by a variety of global manufacturers located primarily in China, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Cambodia. We are not dependent upon any single manufacturer for our products. When determining the size of orders placed with our manufacturers, we take into account forward-looking demand, lead times for specific products, current inventory levels, and minimum order quantity requirements. Overseas production has resulted in substantial cost savings and a reduction of capital investment. With the oversight of our office in Hong Kong and our independent contractors, we believe these financial benefits have been realized without sacrificing the level of quality inherent in our products or service to our customers.
Distribution Center
In 2007, we consolidated our warehousing and shipping functions into one distribution center, located in Roanoke, Indiana. In fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2015, we expanded the facility by 200,000 and 10,000 square-feet, respectively, which resulted in a total distribution center space of approximately 428,500 square-feet. This automated, computerized facility allows Vera Bradley employees to receive information directly from the order-collection center and quickly identify the products and quantities necessary for a particular order. The expansion resulted in capacity gains in the areas of inbound receiving, inventory storage, order fulfillment, value-add processing, and shipping. The facility’s technology enables us to more accurately process and pack orders, as well as track shipments and inventory. We believe that our systems for the processing and shipment of orders from our distribution center have enabled us to improve our overall customer service through enhanced order accuracy and reduced turnaround time. 
Our products are shipped primarily via third-party common carriers to our stores, our Indirect retailers, department stores, and directly to our customers who purchase through our website. We believe we are positioned well to support the order fulfillment requirements of our business, including business generated through our website.
Management Information Systems
We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position. We maintain computer hardware, applications, and networks to enhance and accelerate the design process, to support the sale and distribution of our products to our customers, and to improve the integration and efficiency of our operations. Our information systems are designed to provide, among other things, comprehensive order processing, production, accounting, and management information and analytics for the product development, retail, sales, marketing, distribution, finance, and human resources functions of our business. We constantly evaluate and optimize the efficiency and cost of our on premise and cloud technology platforms to enable the business to provide an exceptional customer experience and increased shareholder value.
Competition
We face strong competition in each of the product lines and markets in which we compete. We believe that all of our products are in similar competitive positions with respect to the number of competitors they face and the level of competition within each product line. Due to the number of different products we offer, it is not practicable for us to quantify the number of competitors we face. Our products compete with other branded products within their product categories and with private label products sold by retailers. In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer. Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. In our Direct business, we compete against other independent retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, gift retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.

The market for handbags, in particular, is highly competitive. Our competitors include not only established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of handbags, but also frequent new entrants to the market. We directly compete with wholesalers and direct sellers of branded handbags and accessories.
In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of design (aesthetic appeal), quality (construction), function, price point, distribution, and brand positioning. We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brand, customer loyalty, product development expertise, and our widespread presence through our multi-channel distribution model. Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do. Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
Copyrights and Trademarks
The development of new patterns includes the design of primary and secondary prints. Once developed, we generally copyright our patterns as appropriate. We currently have approximately 900 copyrights.
We also own the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, and distribution of all of our products, both in the United States and in the other countries in which our products are principally sold. Our trademarks include “Vera Bradley.” We aggressively police our trademarks and copyrights and pursue infringers and counterfeiters both domestically and internationally. Our trademarks will remain in existence for as long as we continue to use and renew them in advance of their expiration dates. We have no material patents.
Employees
As of February 3, 2018, we had approximately 2,730 employees. Of the total, approximately 2,140 were engaged in retail selling positions, approximately 290 were engaged in distribution, sourcing and quality functions, approximately 40 were engaged in product design, and approximately 260 were engaged in corporate support and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a union. We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never encountered a significant work stoppage. 
Government Regulation
Many of our imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the United States and other countries or impact the cost of such products. To date, we have not been restricted by quotas in the operation of our business, and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of a majority of our products. In addition, we are subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against prohibited foreign practices, with respect to our product sourcing and international sales operations.
We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including the handling, transportation, and disposal of our products and our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, and groundwater. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties, or the imposition of other liabilities. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our earnings or financial position. If we violate any laws or regulations, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.
