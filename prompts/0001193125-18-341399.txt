Sales and Marketing 
 ModusLinks sales and marketing staff is strategically and globally aligned to support the development, marketing and sale of its Adaptive Supply Chain Services and solutions worldwide. ModusLinks marketing efforts key on engaging with its target base so as to inform and persuade them of the benefits of its Adaptive Supply Chain Services and convert them into ModusLink clients; and, once being served by ModusLink, to see the value to drawing on more of its capabilities. The approach is to focus on those prospects whose business profile, situation and supply chain needs best map to what ModusLink can offer in terms of supply chain services and what it needs for there to be a win-win partnership with a potential client. The vertical markets/market segments which will be emphasized include technology components (i.e.: semiconductors), computing (systems, storage, software) communications products (wireless devices), consumer electronics (A/V products, smart home electronics and systems, wearables), small home appliances, selected consumer packaged goods categories (long-shelf-life consumables, cosmetics/health & beauty aids), health/healthcare (vitamins/supplements, medical devices, medical supplies), luxury goods, selected apparel categories, industrial and aerospace parts. ModusLink sells its services and solutions on a global scale, through a direct sales channel. ModusLinks strategically aligned, global sales staff identifies new opportunities and cultivates leads throughout North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. ModusLinks sales staff is focused on winning new programs with existing clients, while developing new relationships to further diversify its client base. 
 Because of IWCO Directs scale, sales executives are largely focused on specific industry verticals, leveraging industry expertise to drive clients marketing results through improved response rates, automation, and reduced postage spend. Smaller competitors sales executives are often generalists, not vertical specialists. The majority of the sales force has been with IWCO Direct for at least 10 years; many have more than 20 years experience in the industry and are expected to maintain a robust pipeline. IWCO Direct markets its services and solutions through its website, media relations, trade publications and conferences, and has developed collateral materials, case studies, and other sales tools to support these efforts. The Company sells its direct marketing and omnichannel services and solutions through a direct sales channel. 
 Competition 
 The market for the supply chain management service offerings provided by ModusLink is highly competitive. As a provider with service offerings covering a range of supply chain operations and activities across the globe, ModusLink competes with different companies depending on the type of service it is providing or the geographic area in which an activity is taking place. ModusLink faces competition from Electronics Manufacturing Services/Contract Manufacturers (EMS/CM), third party logistics (3PL) providers, Supply Chain Management (SCM) companies, and regional specialty companies. For certain digital commerce services, ModusLinks competition includes global outsource providers, software as service (SaaS) providers, technology providers and computer software providers offering content and document management solutions. As a provider of an outsourcing solution, ModusLinks competition also includes current and prospective clients, who evaluate ModusLinks capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures. 
 The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are quality and range of solutions and services, technological capabilities, costs, location of facilities, responsiveness, and adaptability. With ModusLinks set of supply chain

  services, global footprint, strong client service acumen, and its integrated global supply chain digital commerce services, the Company believes that it is well positioned to compete in each of the markets it serves, while expanding across various industry subsets. 
 The market for the range of services offered by IWCO Direct is highly competitive and fragmented. IWCO Directs scope and scale of end-to-end services provides a competitive advantage by being able to focus on efficiency while making the end product more effective in driving response for clients. While the ability to offer a more effective marketing product is highly valued, we must continue to provide it a competitive price and aggressively manage our cost structure to maintain our client roster and attract new business. 
 Competitors for our print/mail products and services include printers, envelope manufacturers, and commercial lettershops (i.e. mail service providers). Competitors for our Marketing Services practice include internal and external agencies and data and analytics companies. 
 Clients 
 A limited number of clients account for a significant percentage of the Companys consolidated net revenue. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Companys 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 44%, 70% and 71% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. No clients accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. In general, the Company does not have any agreements which obligate any client to buy a minimum amount of services from the Company, or which designate the Company as its sole supplier of any particular services. The loss of a significant amount of business or program with any key client could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company believes that it will continue to derive the vast majority of its consolidated operating revenue from sales to a small number of clients. There can be no assurance that revenue from key clients will not decline in future periods. 
 The Company sells its services to its clients primarily on a purchase order basis rather than pursuant to contracts with minimum purchase requirements. Consequently, sales are subject to demand variability by such clients. The Company purchases and maintains adequate levels of inventory in order to meet client needs rapidly and on a timely basis. The Company has no guaranteed price, quantity or delivery agreements with its suppliers other than the purchase obligations noted in Note 11 of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 below. Because of the diversity of its services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of its facilities, the Company uses numerous sources for the wide variety of raw materials needed for its operations. The Company is not and does not expect to be adversely affected by an inability to obtain materials. 
 IWCO Directs services include (a) development of direct mail and omnichannel marketing strategies (b) creative services to design direct mail, email, and online marketing (c) printing and compiling of direct mail pieces into envelopes ready for mailing (d) commingling services to sort mail produced for various customers, by destination to achieve optimized postal savings (e) and business continuity and disaster recovery services for critical communications to protect against unexpected business interruptions. The major markets served by IWCO Direct include financial services, Multiple-System Operations (MSO) (cable or direct-broadcast satellite TV systems), insurance and to a lesser extent subscription/services, healthcare, travel/hospitality and other. Direct mail is a critical piece of marketing for most of its current customers who use direct mail to acquire new customers. Management believes that direct mail will remain an important part of its customers budgets for the foreseeable future, based on its proven ability to enhance results when used as part of an omnichannel marketing strategy. 
 International Operations 
 The Company currently conducts business in many countries including China, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Singapore, among others, in addition to its North America operations. IWCO does not currently have international operations. During the year ended July 31, 2018, revenues from our foreign operating segments accounted for approximately 41.2% of total revenues. Refer to Note 20 of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 below. 
 The Companys international operations increase its exposure to U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, and labor practices, which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes, and with which the Company must comply. A substantial portion of our international business is conducted in China, where we face (i) the challenge of navigating a complex set of licensing and tax requirements and restrictions affecting the conduct of business in China by foreign companies, (ii) potential limitations on the repatriation of cash, (iii) foreign currency fluctuation and (iv) evolving tax laws.

 Seasonality 
 The demand of our Supply Chain clients products is subject to seasonal consumer buying patterns. As a result, the services we provide to our clients are also subject to seasonality, with higher revenue and operating income typically being realized from handling our clients products during the first half of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday selling season. IWCO Directs business is not typically subject to seasonal buying patterns. 
Intellectual Property 
 The Company relies upon a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. From time to time, we develop new trade secrets and other intellectual property or obtain intellectual property through acquisition activities. Our business is not substantially dependent on any single or group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses. 
Employees 
 ModusLink: 
 At July 31, 2018, ModusLink employed approximately 1,525 persons on a full-time basis, 263 in the Americas, 805 in Asia and 457 in Europe. Our subsidiaries in Mexico are parties to several collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 41 employees. Our subsidiary in France is party to collective bargaining agreements covering its employees. Approximately 13 of the employees of our Ireland operation are members of labor unions. As of August 2018, approximately 99 of the employees at one of our China operations are members of labor unions. We consider our employee relations to be good. From time to time we hire project-based, temporary workers based on our client needs and seasonality of our business, and at times the number of these workers may approximate the number of our full-time employees. 
IWCO: 
 At July 31, 2018, IWCO Direct employed approximately 2,399 full-time, non-union persons in the U.S. We consider our employee relations to be good. We utilize a temp-to-hire arrangement as needed for direct labor.
