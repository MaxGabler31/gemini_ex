ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
Janel Corporation ("Janel," "Company," or "Registrant") is a holding company with subsidiaries in two business segments: Global Logistics Services and Manufacturing. The Company's Global Logistics Services segment comprises several wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively known as "Janel Group." The Company's Manufacturing segment comprises its majority-owned Indco subsidiary, which manufactures and distributes industrial mixing equipment. Janel is a successor to a business originally formed in 1975. Janel is domiciled in the state of Nevada. Its corporate headquarters is in Lynbrook, New York. Its website is located at http://www.janelcorp.com.
 
A management group at the holding company level (the "corporate group") focuses on significant capital allocation decisions, corporate governance and supporting Janel's subsidiaries where appropriate. Janel expects to grow through its subsidiaries' organic growth and by completing acquisitions. We either will acquire businesses within our existing segments, or we will expand our portfolio into new segments. Our acquisition strategy focuses on reasonably-priced companies with strong and capable management teams, attractive existing business economics and stable and predictable earnings power.
 
In September 2014, the Company purchased the equity of Alpha International, LP and PCL Transport, LLC ("Alpha/PCL"), both global logistics services companies. Approximately one year later, it purchased the equity of Liberty International, Inc. ("Liberty"). On April 1, 2017, the Company acquired the equity of W.J. Byrnes & Co., Inc. ("Byrnes"). These businesses, along with the legacy Janel Group, comprise the Company's Global Logistics Services segment, which focuses on international transportation and customs clearance. In March 2016, the Company purchased Indco, Inc. ("Indco"), a manufacturer and distributor of mixing equipment, which comprises the Company's Manufacturing segment.
 
Janel and its consolidated subsidiaries employ 117 full-time and four part-time people in the United States. None of these employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Janel and its subsidiaries have experienced no work stoppages and consider relations with their employees to be good.
 
Global Logistics Services
 
The Company's Global Logistics Services segment comprises several wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively known as "Janel Group." We acquired Alpha/PCL in September 2014, Liberty in August 2015 and Byrnes in April 2017 in order to add markets and specialties to Janel Group's logistics offerings.
 
Janel Group operates out of eleven leased, full-service locations in the United States: Lynbrook (New York), New York (headquarters, operations and accounting); Boston, Massachusetts; Pawtucket (Providence), Rhode Island; Edison (Newark), New Jersey; Essington (Philadelphia), Pennsylvania; Forest Park (Atlanta), Georgia; Elk Grove Village (Chicago), Illinois; Tucson, Arizona; Torrance (Los Angeles), California; Daly City (San Francisco), California; and Portland, Oregon. Janel Group maintains a network of independent agent relationships in many trading countries, giving it the ability to provide a global service to its clients.
 
Janel Group helps its clients move and manage freight efficiently to reduce inventories and to increase supply chain speed and reliability. Key services include customs entry filing, arrangement of freight forwarding by air, ocean and ground, warehousing, cargo insurance procurement, logistics planning, product repackaging and online shipment tracking. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, Janel Group handled approximately 48,000 individual import and export shipments originating or terminating in the United States, Europe and Asia. Approximately 46% of the revenue from this activity relates to ocean import/export, 19% to air import/export, 11% to customs brokerage and the remainder to ground and other freight forwarding services. Janel Group had one customer that accounted for approximately 12% of Janel Corporation's total revenues in fiscal 2017.
 
Janel Group earns flat fees for certain services, such as customs entry filing. For brokered services, Janel Group earns the difference between the rate charged by a service provider and the rate Janel Group charges the customer for the provider's service. Janel Group's freight consolidation activities, in addition to on-going volume-based relationships with providers, allows Janel Group to command preferred service rates that can be passed on profitably to the customer.
 
The logistics industry is highly fragmented, with low barriers to entry and intense competition. Janel Group competes against providers ranging in size from "mom-and-pop" businesses to multi-national firms with hundreds of offices worldwide. Many Janel Group customers utilize more than one logistics provider.
 
The global forwarding industry requires dealings in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. As a result, Janel Group is exposed to the inherent risks of international currency markets and governmental interference. Some countries in which Janel Group maintains agent relationships have currency control regulations that influence Janel Group's ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. Janel Group tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among those agents.

Historically, Janel Group's quarterly operating results have been subject to seasonal trends. The fiscal third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest and the fiscal second quarter has traditionally been the weakest. This pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces. This historical seasonality has also been influenced by the growth and diversification of Janel Group's international network and service offerings.
 
A significant portion of Janel Group's revenues are derived from customers in industries with shipping patterns tied to consumer demand and/or just-in-time production schedules. Many of Janel Group's customers may ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter. Therefore, the timing of Janel Group revenues is, to a large degree, affected by factors beyond its control, such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays. Janel Group cannot accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can it estimate the relative impact of any given factor. Therefore, there is no assurance that historical patterns will continue in the future.
 
Interstate and international transportation of freight is highly regulated. Failure to comply with applicable state and federal regulations, or to maintain required permits or licenses, can result in substantial fines or revocation of operating permits or authorities imposed on both transportation intermediaries and their shipper customers. We cannot give assurance as to the degree or cost of future regulations on our business. Some of the regulations affecting our current and prospective operations are described below.
 
Each Janel Group company that engages in customs brokerage is licensed as a customs broker by U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("CBP"). All U.S. customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by CBP.
 
Janel Group's activities in the air transportation industry in the United States are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation as an indirect air carrier. Janel Group's overseas agents are licensed as freight forwarders in their respective countries of operation, and certain of Janel Group's offices are licensed as freight forwarders by the International Air Transport Association ("IATA"). IATA is a voluntary association of airlines which prescribes certain operating procedures for freight forwarders acting as agents of its members. Most of Janel Group's freight forwarding business is conducted with airlines that are IATA members.
 
Each Janel Group company that engages in ocean freight is registered as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary and licensed as a non-vessel operating common carrier ("NVOCC") by the Federal Maritime Commission ("FMC"). The FMC has established certain qualifications for shipping agents, including certain surety bonding requirements.
 
Janel Group is subject to U.S. federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment. Similar laws apply in many foreign jurisdictions in which Janel Group operates. Although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws, the Company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on Janel Group. Janel Group does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years.
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company's Manufacturing segment comprises its majority-owned Indco subsidiary, which manufactures and distributes industrial mixing equipment. Indco's headquarters and manufacturing operations are located in a single leased facility in New Albany, Indiana.
 
Indco provides solutions for the mixing needs of customers operating in diverse industries, including chemicals, inks, paints, construction, plastics, adhesives, cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals. Solutions include over 2,500 standard product configurations, both manufactured and distributed, available for order from Indco's website and its print catalog, mailed quarterly. In addition, Indco manufactures custom-designed mixing solutions that Indco helps specify, design, machine, assemble and distribute. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, Indco made approximately 5,900 individual shipments to customers. In fiscal 2017, approximately 82% of Indco's revenue came from manufacturing activity. The remainder came from distribution activity. Indco's revenue generally is level throughout the year with little seasonality.
 
Indco relies on a variety of providers of raw materials, mechanical components and other services in order to manufacture its products. These providers include national and multi-national suppliers for common industrial components such as motors, gear drives, motor controls and many other standard hardware products. Additionally, regional and local suppliers provide Indco-specific parts such as castings and fabricated metal components. Raw materials, primarily steel bar, plate and shaft are sourced from domestic steel mills through local distributors. Alternative or substantially similar options are available from suppliers other than those Indco currently employs. Custom cast or fabricated parts are at greater risk for supply interruption. However, alternative equivalent suppliers are available.

The industrial mixer manufacturing industry is highly fragmented with low barriers to entry. Indco competes with companies of all sizes based on a combination of pricing, lead-times, service, quality and ability to reach customers through internet presence and catalog circulation.
 
Government regulation directly governing Indco's industrial mixer product line is minimal. Changing energy efficiency standards, however, as mandated by the Department of Energy, can, over time, affect electric motor manufacturers whose products are used by Indco.  Historically, these changes have resulted in only minor changes to the product line.
 
Indco is subject to U.S. federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment. Although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws, the Company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on Indco. Indco does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years.  Indco's general cost of compliance with environmental regulations centers around the removal and disposal of process fluids from its metal parts machining operations and the disposal of solid wastes. In fiscal 2017, the approximate cost of pumping, containing and removing waste oils and cutting fluids was $4,000. The annual expense for general solid waste removal was approximately $2,000. Recycling programs are in place for relevant materials including stainless steel, carbon steel and corrugated cardboard.
