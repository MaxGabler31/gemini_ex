ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Our Company
WM Technology, Inc. is one of the oldest and largest marketplace and technology solutions providers exclusively servicing the cannabis industry, primarily consumers, retailers and brands in the United States state-legal and Canadian cannabis markets. Our business consists of our commerce-driven marketplace, Weedmaps, and our monthly subscription software offering, WM Business. Our Weedmaps marketplace provides information on the cannabis plant and the industry and advocates for legalization. The Weedmaps marketplace provides consumers with information regarding cannabis retailers and brands, as well as the strain, pricing, and other information regarding locally available cannabis products, through our website and mobile apps, permitting product discovery, access to deals and discounts, and reservation of products for pickup by consumers or delivery to consumers by participating retailers. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 15 million monthly active users on our marketplace. We believe the size of our user base and the frequency of consumption of cannabis of that user base is highly valuable to our clients and results in clients paying for our services. WM Business, our subscription package, is a comprehensive set of eCommerce and compliance software solutions catered towards cannabis retailers, delivery services and brands where clients receive access to a standard listing page and our suite of software solutions, including WM Orders, WM Dispatch, WM Store, WM Dashboard, our integrations and API platform, as well as access to our WM Retail and WM Exchange products, where available. We charge a monthly fee to clients for access to our WM Business subscription package and then offer other add-on products for additional fees, including our featured listings and our Sprout (customer relationship management) and Cannveya (delivery and logistics software) solutions. We sell our WM Business offering in the United States, currently offer some of our WM Business solutions in Canada and have a limited number of non-monetized listings in several other countries, including Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. We operate in the United States, Canada, and other foreign jurisdictions where medical and/or adult cannabis use is legal under state or applicable national law. We are headquartered in Irvine, California.
WM Technology’s Product and Solution Ecosystem
We were founded in 2008 and operate a leading online marketplace with a comprehensive set of eCommerce and compliance software solutions sold to retailers and brands in the U.S. state-legal and Canadian cannabis markets. The Company’s mission is to power a transparent and inclusive global cannabis economy. We address the challenges facing both consumers seeking to understand cannabis products and businesses who serve cannabis users in a legally compliant fashion with our Weedmaps marketplace and WM Business software solutions. Over the past 13 years, we have grown the Weedmaps marketplace to become a premier destination for cannabis consumers to discover and browse information regarding cannabis

and cannabis products, permitting product discovery and order-ahead for pickup or delivery by participating retailers. WM Business is a set of eCommerce-enablement tools designed to help our retailer and brand clients get the best out of their Weedmaps experience, while creating labor efficiency and managing their compliance needs. 
The state-legal cannabis industry in the United States has grown consistently in recent years and is expected to double between 2020 and 2025 (according to Arcview Market Research/BDS Analytics1), with 91% of U.S. adults now in support having legal access to medical and/or adult-use cannabis. Despite these expectations of growth, the regulated cannabis market in the United States is still nascent and fragmented, with significant challenges facing both consumers seeking to understand cannabis and the cannabis industry and businesses seeking to effectively market to cannabis consumers as well as compliantly manage their operations. Cannabis users within the United States represent less than 13% of the adult population as of December 31, 2020, with those consuming at least one time a month representing an even smaller percentage, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimates. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 11,700 retail licenses across U.S. and Canadian markets with medical and/or adult-use regulations in place, which is an effective retail density of approximately one retail license per 22,000 residents across these markets in the aggregate, based on data available from individual governmental cannabis license databases, U.S. Census Bureau estimates and Statistics Canada for both licenses and population.
In addition to these nascent consumer and business dynamics, cannabis itself is a highly complex, highly regulated and non-shelf stable consumer good spanning hundreds of strains and a growing set of form factors available for consumption across flower, pre-rolls, vapes, edibles, tinctures, and concentrates. Despite these complexities, consumers seeking information regarding cannabis still expect the same ease of product discovery and price comparison across multiple channels, and transparency of information from cannabis businesses that they expect from other retailers or brands. These consumer expectations, coupled with the lack of normalized product information in the industry in addition to the unique attributes of cannabis as a nascent and highly regulated consumer product, create significant challenges for retailers and brands who serve cannabis users. Retailers and brands must meet these consumer expectations and provide omni-channel engagement opportunities with the same level of (i) service, (ii) richness of product information, (iii) ability to compare prices, and (iv) ease of product and brand discovery that consumers would receive when researching other consumer product categories. Further, brands are limited in their ability to market and sell directly and need to find ways to communicate to consumers. At the same time, these businesses must comply with a rapidly evolving legal and regulatory landscape that differs by state and across cities and counties within each state, creating challenges in the ability to scale in a capital-efficient way.
Although we began as a marketplace, over the past few years, we have developed and launched several SaaS solutions for our retailer and brand clients. These solutions now comprise an integrated platform for retailers and brands, which we call “WM Business”. WM Business is a set of e-commerce enablement tools designed to help our retailer and brand clients get the best out of their Weedmaps experience, while creating labor efficiency and managing their compliance needs, which can include, depending on each state’s regulations, inventory management, separating sales to medical versus recreational users, product dollar limits in delivery vehicles and GPS tracking of delivery fleet. We offer this functionality through a packaged software solution that includes (based on availability within any given market and state-level regulations) (i) a listing page with product menu on weedmaps.com, our iOS Weedmaps mobile application and our Android Weedmaps mobile application, which allows clients to disclose their license information, hours of operation, contact information, discount policies, and other information that may be required under applicable state law, (ii) the ability to receive reservations of products for pickup by consumers or delivery to consumers (either on weedmaps.com, on a white labeled WM Store site or third-party sites through our orders and menu embed product), thereby allowing inventory forecasting and helping retailers ensure sufficient staff are present to confirm product availability (and complete orders and process payments – both of which only occur outside the Weedmaps marketplace), (iii) logistics software such as driver apps and fleet-tracking tools to permit legal compliance with state delivery regulations, (iv) customer relationship management software, (v) access to our application program interface (“API”), and integrations platform for real-time connectivity between WM Business and to a point-of-sale system (“POS”) to streamline workflows, and promoting compliance through accuracy (vi) analytics dashboards, (vii) a WM-owned point-of-sale system (where available) and (viii) access to our online wholesale exchange marketplace to browse brand catalogs and efficiently identify brands to obtain inventory from (and review license information and certificates of analysis, among other compliance features). We also offer a growing set of offerings for brands to reach consumers and retailers as well as manage their brand catalog information.
Our WM Business solution is sold as a monthly subscription package. We also offer several upsell and add-on products that allow businesses to have more prominent placement on the Weedmaps marketplace either through featured

listings, display ads or promoted deal offerings. Additionally, we have CRM, logistics and fulfillment software and driver app solutions available as add-on solutions. We sell our WM Business offerings in the United States, currently sell a subset of them in Canada, and we have a limited number of non-monetized listings in several other countries including Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland. As of December 31, 2021, we actively operated in over 20 U.S. states and territories that have adult-use and/or medical-use regulations in place. We define actively operated markets as those U.S. states or territories with greater than $1,000 monthly recurring revenue.
As we continue to expand the presence and increase the number of consumers on the Weedmaps marketplace and broaden our SaaS offerings, we generate more value for our business clients. As we continue to expand the presence and increase the number of cannabis businesses listed on weedmaps.com, we become a more compelling marketplace for consumers. To capitalize on the growth opportunities of our two-sided marketplace and solutions, we plan to continue making investments in raising brand awareness, increasing penetration within existing markets and expanding to new markets, as well as continuing to develop and monetize new software solutions to extend the functionality of our platform, deepening the consumer experience with our platform, and providing a high level of support to our business clients.
While the cannabis industry is still in the early innings of what could be decades of growth, we have established a leading position and a recognized brand given our 13-year operating history. Over the coming years, we plan on expanding our solutions and service offerings.
Challenges in Our End-Markets
Despite cannabis being a large and growing sector in the U.S., we believe that cannabis is unlike many other consumer goods and retail categories for a number of reasons:
•Cannabis as a regulated industry is still in a nascent stage of development.
•Cannabis users are less than 13% of the U.S. adult population today without a “typical” user profile. 
•Regulations governing cannabis are complex and vary state-by-state and by city and county within states. 
•Cannabis has wide variance in characteristics that make it complex for consumers to make an informed purchase decision. 
•Cannabis is a perishable good with a lack of product homogeneity. 
•Brands are only in the early innings of establishing a consumer presence. 
•Competition with the illicit market is still an issue, particularly in states like California. 
Our Solution
Our solutions are designed to address these challenges facing cannabis consumers and businesses. The Weedmaps marketplace allows cannabis users to search for and browse cannabis products from retailers and brands, and ultimately reserve products from certain local retailers, in a manner similar to other technology platforms with breadth and depth of product, brand, and retailer selection (although confirmation of orders and processing of payments only occur outside the Weedmaps marketplace through third-party service providers directly by our clients). With the development of our WM Business SaaS solution, we offer an end-to-end platform for licensed cannabis retailers to comply with state law. We sell a monthly subscription offering as well as upsell and add-on offerings to licensed clients, which include both dispensaries, delivery services and brands. Our current solutions include:
•WM Business subscription offering. Our WM Business monthly subscription package consists of the following solutions, the availability of which depends on the client’s market:
◦WM Pages. Listing page with product menu, which allows clients to disclose their license information, hours of operation, contact information, discount policies, and other information that may be required under applicable state law.
◦WM Orders. Transmission of requests for reservation of products for pick-up by consumers or delivery to consumers, allowing retailers to confirm product availability (and to complete orders and process payments - both of which only occur outside the Weedmaps marketplace). Weedmaps serves only as a portal, passing a consumer’s inquiry to the dispensary. After a dispensary receives the order request from the consumer, the dispensary and the consumer can continue to communicate, adjust items in the request, and handle any stock issues, prior to and while the dispensary processes and fulfills the order.
◦WM Dispatch. Together with Cannveya (described below), WM Dispatch provides logistics and fulfillment software and driver apps, which provide tools that can be used for legally compliant delivery and tracking of product reserved online through WM Orders and real-time routing and tracking of the state-licensed delivery fleet.
◦WM Dashboard. Insights dashboard, which provides data and analytics on user engagement and traffic trends to a client’s listing page.
◦WM Store. Orders and menu embed, which allows retailers and brands to import their Weedmaps listing menu or product reservation functionality to their own white-labeled WM Store site or separately owned third party sites in a labor-efficient way to manage their online presence, inventory, and compliance workflows both on weedmaps.com and their separately branded sites. While WM Store permits consumers to reserve products, confirmation of product availability, final order entry, order fulfillment and processing of payments all take place outside of the Weedmaps marketplace.
◦Integrations and APIs. A platform of integrations and API tools or bespoke solutioning to integrate a business into the WM Technology ecosystem. This creates business efficiencies and improves the accuracy and timeliness of information across Weedmaps, creating a more positive experience for consumers and businesses.
◦In a limited number of U.S. markets, we offer WM Retail, our retail POS system, which provides inventory management and track-and-trace compliance reporting functionality along with built-in integrations with the listing page product menu and digital product reservation functionality to stream-line workflows, and WM Exchange, our wholesale online exchange, which allows retailers to browse brand catalogs and identify brands to obtain inventory from and brands to manage their customer relationships and wholesale operations.. We no longer plan to expand the availability of these products into additional states, but instead plan to focus POS-related and B2B-related efforts on our API integrations with third-party POS providers, which we believe make the Weedmaps marketplace more attractive for retailers who use a third party POS.
•Additional offerings for subscription clients. We offer several add-on and upsell solutions only to paying subscription clients, including:
◦Featured listings on our weedmaps.com marketplace; and
◦Promoted deals, which allows retailers to showcase discounts (as is required by applicable law in some jurisdictions) and promotions on products to assist price-conscious consumers.
•Additional a la carte products.
◦Advertising solutions. We also provide several a la carte advertising solutions including banner ads and promotion tile cards on our Weedmaps marketplace, as well as banner ads that can be tied to keyword searches. These products provide clients with targeted ad solutions in highly visible slots across our digital surfaces. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we began testing a multi-channel media offering product to our clients and the development of this product will continue into 2022. 
◦Sprout. In September 2021, we acquired certain assets of the Sprout business (“Sprout”). Sprout is a cloud-based customer relationship management (“CRM”) and marketing platform with the ability to run text messaging, email, and loyalty campaigns to retarget and reengage cannabis consumers.
◦Cannveya. In September 2021, we acquired Transport Logistics Holding Company, LLC, which is the parent company to Cannveya. Together with WM Dispatch, these services provide logistics and fulfillment software and driver apps, which provide tools that can be used for legally compliant delivery and tracking of product reserved online through WM Orders and real-time routing and tracking of the state-licensed delivery fleet.
Our Competitive Strengths
Since our founding in 2008, we have grown to become a leading provider of technology solutions to the cannabis industry by leveraging our competitive strengths, including:
Long History as a Technology Leader Serving the Cannabis Industry. Founded in 2008, we have a long history and established relationships with cannabis businesses and consumers across the United States. This has given us several competitive strengths, such as scale, attractive operating margins, and local insights into emerging consumer and business trends across many markets. Our policy and government relations expertise allows us to anticipate and react quickly to changes in cannabis regulations and informs all aspects of our business, including our product ideation, development and go-to-market strategies.
Largest Two-Sided Platform for Cannabis Businesses and Consumers. We estimate that approximately 55% of all licensed cannabis retailers across the U.S. markets are our paying clients on the platform as of December 31, 2021. As we continue to increase the number of users on our platform, we generate more engagements and more easily persuade our business clients to consolidate their service providers by switching to our value-priced WM Business bundled solution. As we continue to increase the number of businesses on our marketplace, we become a more compelling platform for users. As more businesses and users join the platform, we gain a richer trove of industry data to perform market research and assist in product development and improvement. The result is a self-reinforcing, mutually beneficial, two-sided network effect, which we believe is difficult to replicate.
The Only Fully-Integrated Business-in-a-Box SaaS Solution Specific to the Cannabis Industry. Our WM Business is the industry’s only comprehensive business-in-a-box solution and incorporates embedded compliance functionality so that our clients comply with state law through integrated software solutions ranging from live menus, logistics and fulfillment, CRM, POS integrations, inventory management, and data and analytics. We believe we are the only platform servicing cannabis that combines both marketplace and software - most other technology providers offer single-point software solutions without the marketplace or marketplace without software. We believe we offer the only comprehensive software platform that allows cannabis retailers to reach their target audience, quickly and cost effectively, addressing a wide range of needs. Our platform also features self-service administrative functionality that enables clients to manage their listings page, including adding images, adjusting their menus, editing product information and responding to reviews as well as analyzing traffic trends.
Unique and Growing Data Asset. Given our established presence, scale, and the breadth of product offerings that provide us with a high volume of retail-level information and user insights, we have a growing and unique first-party data asset. Currently, the cannabis industry has few reliable sources of fulsome datasets. Our data gives us insights on local market trends and the shape of the consumer journey from exploration and discovery to point of direct interaction with retailers across multiple retailers, brands and products. As our network of clients and consumers continues to grow, our data set will become deeper and richer, increasing its value and our potential monetization opportunities.
Ability to Innovate Rapidly and Launch New Products Efficiently at Scale. We have an agile product innovation and deployment process. Our sales team frequently engages with our paid clients about the products they use, as well as their business objectives and performance. We constantly strive to generate product ideas through this deep engagement with our clients, as well as empirical research. During the initial development phases, we test a proposed offering with relevant areas of our business such as sales, government relations and compliance, legal, marketing, and technology, and use the resulting cross-functional input to develop a clear business rationale and explicit articulation of the goals, client problems that need to be solved, compliance features that need to be incorporated, and potential product-market fit prior to the investment of developer time and company resources. We leverage reusable microservices architecture and modular technology that can be redeployed across multiple new offerings for quicker development cycles. This streamlined approach yields smaller initiatives requiring less investment, enabling us to deliver cost-effective product innovation at a rapid pace.
Capital-Efficient Business Model with Strong Cashflow Generation. We operate a cloud-based platform, and unlike other cannabis-related businesses, we require minimal physical footprint and are not directly exposed to fluctuations in product input costs. We do not require real estate or other significant capital outlays to enter new markets. Our offerings can be efficiently customized to new markets to facilitate expansion, which provides significant flexibility to scale and enter new markets with minimal investment. The capital-efficiency of our business model is evidenced by our robust margin profile and high level of EBITDA converting to free cash flow while achieving our growth.
Operationally-Focused Management Team with Deep Experience. Our executive leadership team has over 100 years of cumulative professional experience spanning the technology, consumer, retail, legal and financial services industries, with a track record of operational execution and driving growth. Our Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Beals, established our government relations, legal and compliance functions, built-out the senior leadership team, and developed (and led the execution of) our “business-in-a-box” strategy. We believe our deep knowledge of our end-markets and broad-based operational expertise spanning several industry sectors provides a key competitive advantage in executing against our growth strategy.
Our Growth Strategy
As a leading marketplace and software platform, our goal is to not only grow our market share but to grow the entire market by influencing policy promoting wider access to licensed cannabis, educating consumers on how to shop for cannabis and providing licensed operators with the tools they need to access users and grow their businesses. However, given our share of cannabis consumers and businesses, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on underlying growth across our end-markets by executing against our strategy as follows:
•Grow Our Two-Sided Marketplace. Our goal is to be the center of commerce for consumers seeking cannabis. To support this goal, we intend to continue growing the number of consumers on our platform through original content that educates, entertains, facilitates discovery of new products, increases awareness of our platform and encourages repeat usage. As we grow our users and user engagements, we will continue to engage with our clients to demonstrate the value we believe they receive on our platform and can convince more businesses to increase adoption of our WM Business services through our WM Business subscription offering and additional offerings.
•Expand Our Existing Markets and Enter New Markets. We have a significant opportunity to grow our client base both within existing markets that are continuing to grow and new markets as they become open to regulated cannabis. Although we are increasingly becoming a more nationally-recognized brand, we are monetizing our platform in over 20 U.S. states and territories, as of December 31, 2021. Based on our internal research, we believe the minimum level of acceptable retail density to have a healthy and functioning licensed market is a minimum of one licensed retailer per 10,000 residents. Many of the U.S. states where we operate today are still under-penetrated with low levels of licensed retail density.
We believe that there are tremendous growth opportunities for us within our existing markets as retail licenses continue to be issued, and states move towards, and beyond, the one retail license per 10,000 people ratio. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 11,700 existing retail licenses across the United States and Canada markets. Assuming no cap on the number of licenses issued or other restrictions on the number of licenses issued, if these same markets were to issue enough licenses to match a ratio of one license per 10,000 residents, approximately 10,000 new retail licenses would be issued. This may require continued liberalization of license restrictions across cities and counties within certain of our states where we do business today. With the momentum of state legalization, including a sweep of ballot initiatives in five states during the most recent election, we believe that legalization by additional states and eventually the U.S. government is inevitable. Assuming no cap on the number of licenses issued or other restrictions on the number of licenses issued, if the entire United States and Canada reached a minimum level of density of one license per 10,000 residents, we believe the total universe of retail licenses would reach approximately 37,500, which is approximately 3.2 times the current count of retail licenses in the United States and Canada as seen below. This represents a significant growth opportunity for us as every new retail license issued is an opportunity to onboard a new client onto our platform and increase their monthly spend as they leverage more of our services, solutions and upsell / add-on products.
Expand our WM Business SaaS solution and grow Gross Merchandise Value (“GMV”). We intend to continue expanding the functionality of our WM Business solutions through additional offerings of premium analytics, CRM, and loyalty tools, among other solutions, which we intend to monetize through additional higher priced tiers within our subscription offering. We will continue to expand the availability of our POS integrations across additional states. We also are continuously improving the base-level functionality across our WM Business solutions. We believe these initiatives will result in a more engaged client who utilizes more of our services across our platform and is more ripe for monetization opportunities over time. While we do not believe GMV is a driver of our revenue currently, GMV could represent significant monetization potential over time to the extent U.S. federal regulations allow us to monetize our clients’ currently off-platform transaction activity through take-rates or payment fees, which we do not engage in today.
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We take a measured approach to acquisition-related growth, preferring to selectively make strategic software acquisitions, such as our recent transactions for Sprout, Cannveya and CannCurrent, that complement 
our existing offerings. We intend to continue selectively pursuing opportunities to invest in and acquire technology offerings that allow us to accelerate our growth.
Competition
Our direct competitors for individual components of our platform include cannabis-focused, technology companies like Leafly (for retailer listing pages), Dutchie and Jane Technologies (for menu embed and orders functionality), Leaflink and Leaf Trade (for B2B sales) and a variety of cannabis-focused point-of-sale providers, marketing and advertising technology solutions. In addition, for our retail listing pages, our platform may also compete with current or potential products and solutions offered by internet search engines and advertising networks like Google, Yelp, various other newspaper, television and media companies, as well as outdoor billboard advertising. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include the scale of our network, comprehensiveness of offerings, ease of adoption and use, and ability to facilitate compliance with the complex, disparate regulations applicable to businesses operating in the cannabis industry, breadth and trustworthiness of information available to consumers, and brand. We believe we compete favorably based on these factors.
For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section entitled “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We currently face intense competition in the market, and we expect competition to further intensify as the cannabis industry continues to evolve.”
Sales and Marketing
Sales
Our sales team is primarily based out of our Irvine, California headquarters. Members of our sales team are knowledgeable about the products and add-ons that we offer, such as our Deals platform or WM Orders, and assist new and existing clients with our platform.
We generate many leads for new listing pages through the applicable state cannabis regulators’ lists of licensees. Other leads are created from inbound requests by applicants for cannabis licenses to begin establishing their business’ presence on our platform pending an expected cannabis license.
Marketing
We believe the quality and strength of our platform is our most valuable marketing asset, the vast majority of business sales leads being inbound. Our marketing strategy, across both consumers and businesses, consists of user acquisition, brand marketing, communications and field marketing.
Our consumer marketing efforts focus on driving awareness of the platform, acquiring new users who may be interested in the platform and increasing engagement of existing users. To augment the engagement of our platform, we employ a series of lifecycle marketing, social media and SEO tactics that have increased our direct & organic traffic. Though many traditional paid marketing channels (such as broadcast television or Google search and display ads) are not available to platforms in the cannabis industry, we have been able to build a reliable network of online tactics that allow us to accelerate the growth of our consumer base at very competitive customer acquisition costs. Additionally, we seek key broad consumer opportunities to cement our place in consumers’ minds as the premier cannabis marketplace such as our August 2021 partnership announcement with Kevin Durant and Thirty Five Ventures and sponsorship deal with the Boardroom, our second virtual 4/20 event, “Even Higher Together,” to celebrate the holiday which was hosted by Snoop Dogg, as well as the 2020 sponsorship of the Mike Tyson vs. Roy Jones, Jr. pay-per-view fight, one of the top 10 most purchased combat sports events of all time.
Our business marketing focus is to drive awareness of the breadth of our software offering among cannabis retailers and brands, given how nascent some of our newer offerings are. We do so through direct physical and digital marketing, working with local cannabis business associations, and through lifecycle marketing with existing clients. Given the strength of our brand, we have seen strength in performance of our tactics in what is a crowded market, easing the acquisition or upsell process for our sales team.
Social Impact
To support the growth of an inclusive cannabis industry, we participate in policy panels and organize educational sessions to educate attendees about the importance of social equity programs and other policy initiatives that are designed to ensure the ability of people of color and those impacted by the war on drugs to participate in the legal cannabis markets that are opening (i.e. social equity licensing programs). Additionally, our policy team has drafted white papers and mock legislative provisions that are designed to support the enactment of social equity licensing programs and advocates for state and local governments to enact social equity licensing programs. We have also established a program, WM Teal, which stands for “Together for Equity Access and Legislation”, through which we provide free software, advertising, educational materials and training programs to applicants or licenses under social equity licensing programs.
Research and Development
Our product development efforts focus on adding new features and solutions to our platform, as well as increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our platform. While we expect research and development expenses to increase as we continue to increase the functionality of our platform, we expect our research and development expenses to remain the same percentage of total revenues.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are valuable assets that are important to our business. In our efforts to safeguard our copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other intellectual property rights worldwide, we rely on a combination of federal, state, common law and international rights in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names, taglines and logos in the United States, Canada, the European Union and other jurisdictions to the extent we determine they are appropriate and cost-effective.
As of December 31, 2021, we have been issued trademark registrations in the United States, Canada, Japan, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Mexico. We have also been issued an international trademark registration with designation in Australia and the European Union for “Weedmaps.” As of December 31, 2021, we have pending trademark applications in the United States covering: “WM TECH” and “WM TECHNOLOGY”, as well as a pending trademark application in the United States covering “Weedmaps” for delivery platform services. We also have pending trademark applications in Canada covering “Weedmaps”.
In addition to our numerous trademark applications and registrations, we have been issued copyright registrations in the United States for our weedmaps.com website, “Grow One,” and two versions of our Lab API documentation. Further, we own several domain names, including: weedmaps.com, marijuana.com, cannabis.com, wmpolicy.com, themuseumofweed.com, wm-retail.com, wmforbusiness.com and WM store. Our trademarks and domain names are material to our business and brand identity.
We also rely on non-disclosure agreements, invention assignment agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, or license agreements with employees, independent contractors, consumers, software providers and other third parties, which protect and limit access to and use of our proprietary intellectual property.
Though we rely, in part, upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees, as well as the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For more information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry.”
People Operations and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 606 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee, including 242 in engineering, product and design, 264 in sales and marketing, and 101 in general and administrative and professional services. Of these employees, 595 are located in the United States, and 12 are located in Canada.
We believe that being able to attract and retain top talent is both a strategic advantage for us and necessary to realize our mission of powering a transparent and inclusive global cannabis economy. Our position as a leading technology provider to 
the cannabis industry helps us attract high caliber employees who are technologically skilled and also passionate about our mission and products. We devote substantial resources to this task. Our dedicated, best-in-class Talent Acquisition team is focused on finding and attracting diverse and capable talent, and our People & Culture team is set on building a world class employer of choice for that talent once they get here. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Government Regulation
Numerous countries and territories have moved in recent years to regulate and tax cannabis, particularly medical cannabis. Most of these jurisdictions present complex regulatory regimes that require licensed operators to comply with substantial reporting, testing, packaging, distribution, and security requirements.
United States and Territories
Notwithstanding the trend toward further state legalization, the U.S. government continues to categorize cannabis as an illegal Schedule I controlled substance, and accordingly the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale, advertisement of sale and possession by our customers violate federal law, as discussed further in the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry.”
While the Obama and Trump administrations have had different stated policies, including the latter’s less friendly position on the industry, the U.S. federal government has not prioritized the enforcement of the CSA’s prohibition on cannabis against cannabis companies complying with the state law and their vendors for over seven years.
Since 2014, versions of the U.S. omnibus spending bill have included a provision prohibiting the DOJ, which includes the Drug Enforcement Administration, from using appropriated funds to prevent states from implementing their medical-use cannabis laws. Federal courts have held that the provision prohibits the DOJ from spending funds to prosecute individuals who engage in conduct permitted by state medical-use cannabis laws and who strictly comply with such laws.
During his campaign, President Biden promised federal reform on cannabis, including decriminalization generally. While the administration since has shown little interest in cannabis reform, Biden’s pledge to “decriminalize” cannabis may reasonably be interpreted to mean that any Attorney General under his administration will order U.S. Attorneys not to enforce the federal cannabis prohibition against state law compliant entities and others legally transacting business with them.
Although the U.S. Attorney General, Merrick Garland, could issue policy guidance to federal prosecutors that they should not interfere with cannabis businesses operating in compliance with states’ laws, any such guidance would not have the force of law, and could not be enforced by the courts. During his confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate, Judge Garland testified that prosecuting state-legal cannabis companies would not be a “useful use of limited resources.” Therefore, the status quo of federal non-enforcement is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, though of course that is not certain. While industry observers are hopeful that changes in Congress and the Senate, along with a Biden presidency, will increase the chances of cannabis or at least cannabis-banking reform, it is not a certainty. A number of bills would affect the legal status of cannabis. The Secure and Fair Enforcement (“SAFE”) Banking Act, would allow financial institutions to legally provide services to state-licensed and compliant cannabis operators, and has passed the House of Representatives but not the Senate. A number of other bills expected to be introduced or reintroduced into the 117th Congress could affect the legal status of cannabis in the United States, though whether any of them will become law is uncertain. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) released a discussion draft of proposed legislation, the Cannabis Administration And Opportunity Act, which they plan to introduce as a bill that would decriminalize cannabis and expunge prior cannabis convictions. Recently introduced into Congress is another bill, the States Reform Act, introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), which would repeal the federal prohibition of cannabis. Based on the momentum seen last year, legislative efforts to legalize cannabis or cannabis banking at the national level are likely to continue in 2022.
Some of our retail clients sell products with CBD derived from hemp with and without THC from non-hemp cannabis. Until recently, hemp and hemp’s extracts (except mature stalks, fiber produced from the stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds and any other compound, manufacture, salt derivative, mixture or preparation of such parts) were illegal Schedule I controlled substances under the CSA. The Agricultural Act of 2014, Pub. L. 113-79 (the “2014 Farm Bill”) authorized states to establish industrial hemp research programs. The majority of states established programs purportedly in compliance with the 2014 Farm Bill. Many industry participants and even states interpreted the law to include “research” into the commercialization of, and commercial markets for, CBD from hemp, including products containing CBD.
In December 2018, the U.S. government changed hemp’s legal status. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-334 (the “2018 Farm Bill”), removed hemp and extracts of hemp, including CBD, from the CSA schedules. Accordingly, the production, sale and possession of hemp or extracts of hemp, including certain CBD products, no longer violate the CSA. The states have implemented a patchwork of different laws on hemp and its extracts, including CBD. Additionally, the FDA claims that the Food, Drugs & Cosmetics Act significantly limits the legality of hemp-derived CBD products.
We have been neither a defendant in a criminal action nor the subject of a civil or regulatory enforcement proceeding, prosecuted by a U.S. governmental authority based on our provision of products and solutions to the cannabis industry. In addition, we believe that Section 230 provides immunity from civil and state criminal liability to internet service provider intermediaries in the United States, such as us, for content provided on their platforms that they did not create or develop. We do not create or develop the information that appears on our clients’ listing pages and other advertising placements, although our moderation teams may take down a client’s information if it breaches our listing restrictions or admonish consumers who post reviews that violate our community terms of use (which, for example, prohibit profanity and racism). We do author and edit certain original content that appears in other sections of our site, such as WM News, WM Learn and WM Policy. All of these sections are general news and information, and none of these sections are advertisements for, or listing pages of, cannabis businesses. For additional information about Section 230, see the sections entitled “Business—Overview” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry.” Our clients are subject to licensing and related requirements under applicable laws and regulations, and our own compliance policies, and some of our clients currently and in the future may not be in compliance with all such requirements. Currently, we require all cannabis retailers on Weedmaps to display a valid, unexpired state-issued license number on their listing. We have a dedicated Trust and Safety team that reviews license information, both on submission and on an ongoing basis, to ensure validity and accuracy. For certain Weedmaps products or services, we may request additional verification and documentation. Additionally, we require contractual representations and warranties from our clients that they are complying with state law. If, despite our policies to verify state-licensure, unlicensed or noncompliant businesses are able to access our products, it could subject us to legal or regulatory enforcement and negative publicity, which could adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition, brand and reputation.
Canada
Medical cannabis has been legal in Canada since 1999 through various regulatory regimes. On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act (Canada) came into force. The Cannabis Act governs both the medical and the regulated adult-use markets in Canada. Prior to October 17, 2018, legal access to and use of medical cannabis in Canada was regulated under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and the associated Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations, or ACMPR. Under the Cannabis Act, holders of licenses to cultivate and/or process cannabis are also permitted to supply cannabis under their existing licenses obtained pursuant to the ACMPR to the regulated adult-use market.
The distribution and sale of cannabis for adult use is regulated separately by each provincial and territorial government, and as such, regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In each of the provinces and territories, except for Saskatchewan, a provincial distributor is responsible for purchasing cannabis from producers and selling products to its regulated retail distribution channels. In addition, in each province and territory, other than Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the provincial distributor is solely responsible for online sales. With respect to retail sales of cannabis, other than online sales, the provincial and territorial regulations in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, and the Northwest Territories allow only for government-run cannabis stores, while the provincial and territorial regulations in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Yukon leave the retail sale of cannabis, other than online sales, to the private sector. In Newfoundland, British Columbia and Nunavut, provincial and territorial regulations allow for a hybrid model in which both public and private stores can operate.
The regulations promulgated under the Cannabis Act, or the Cannabis Regulations, provide more detail on the medical and adult-use regulatory regimes for cannabis, including regarding licensing, security clearances and physical security requirements, product practices, outdoor growing, security, packaging and labelling, cannabis-containing compounds, document retention requirements, reporting and disclosure requirements, the new access to cannabis for medical purposes regime and industrial hemp regulations (both of which are substantially similar to the medical cannabis and industrial hemp regulatory regimes that existed prior to the Cannabis Act coming into force). Under the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations, Health Canada has been granted the authority to issue a wide range of licenses, including licenses for standard cultivation, micro-cultivation, industrial hemp cultivation and nursery cultivation, licenses for standard processing and micro- processing, and sales licenses.
The Cannabis Act prohibits all cannabis promotion unless specifically authorized thereunder. Under Subsection 17(1) of the Cannabis Act, it is prohibited to promote cannabis or a cannabis accessory or any service related to cannabis, including (a) by communicating information about its price or distribution; (b) by doing so in a manner that there are reasonable grounds to believe could be appealing to young persons; (c) by means of a testimonial or endorsement, however displayed or communicated; (d) by means of the depiction of a person, character or animal, whether real or fictional; or (e) by presenting it or any of its brand elements in a manner that associates it or the brand element with, or evokes a positive or negative emotion about or image of, a way of life such as one that includes glamour, recreation, excitement, vitality, risk or daring.
Authorized promotions under the Cannabis Act include those by licensed businesses and others, limited to informational content or brand preference promotion. Informational promotion is promotion that contains factual information to the consumer about cannabis, cannabis accessories, and services related to cannabis, including their availability and price. Brand-preference promotion is promotion of cannabis, cannabis accessories, and services related to cannabis based on their brand characteristics. Businesses that are authorized to produce, sell or distribute cannabis under the Act may promote cannabis by means of an informational promotion or brand preference promotion so long as the person responsible for the promotion, if a telecommunication, has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the promotion cannot be accessed by a young person.
As discussed elsewhere in this prospectus, we believe that Section 230 provides immunity from civil and state criminal liability to internet service provider intermediaries in the United States, such as us, for content provided on their platforms that they did not create or develop. While Article 19.17.2 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”), which became effective on July 1, 2020, contains language which is similar to Section 230(c)(1) of the Communications Decency Act, there is currently no statutory equivalent to Section 230 in Canada. While the case law in Canada on this point is not extensive, however, we believe that courts in Canada have tended to exclude digital platforms in Canada, such as us, from aiding-and-abetting liability for publishing third-party content on their platforms where the platform providers act as “mere conduits” for the content. For additional information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry.” We do not create or develop the information that appears in our clients’ listing pages and other advertising placements, although our moderation teams may take down a client’s information if it breaches our listing restrictions or admonish consumers who post reviews that violate our community terms of use (which, for example, prohibit profanity and racism). We do author and edit certain original content that appears in other sections of our site, such as WM News, WM Learn and WM Policy. All of these sections are general news and information, and none of these sections are advertisements for, or listing pages of, cannabis businesses. Currently, we require all cannabis retailers on Weedmaps to display a valid, unexpired state-issued license number on their listing. We have a dedicated Trust and Safety team that reviews license information, both on submission and on an ongoing basis, to ensure validity and accuracy. For certain Weedmaps products or services, we may request additional verification and documentation. If, despite our policies to verify state-licensure, unlicensed or noncompliant businesses are able to access our products, it could subject us to legal or regulatory enforcement and negative publicity, which could adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition, brand and reputation.
We have not been a defendant in a criminal action, nor have we been the subject of a civil or regulatory enforcement proceeding, prosecuted by a Canadian governmental authority based on our provision of products and solutions to the cannabis industry.
Rest of the World
Legalized cannabis is expanding in other parts of the world with countries adopting varying degrees of legalization or decriminalization. We do not yet regard these countries as viable marketplaces for our products, though we have ongoing tests of a small number of listings in several markets where that product is legally permissible.
