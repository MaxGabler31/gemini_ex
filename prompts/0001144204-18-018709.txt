Item 1. Business
 
Limbach Holdings, Inc. (the “Company” or “Successor”), formerly known as 1347 Capital Corp. (“1347 Capital”), is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Company was originally incorporated as a special purpose acquisition company on April 15, 2014, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more entities. On July 20, 2016 (the “Acquisition Date” or the “Closing Date”), the Company consummated a business combination (“Business Combination”) with Limbach Holdings LLC (“LHLLC”) and changed its name from 1347 Capital Corp. to Limbach Holdings, Inc. See Note 4 – Business Combination in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further discussion.
 
The Company is a commercial specialty contractor in the areas of heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (‘‘HVAC’’), plumbing, electrical and building controls for the design and construction of new and renovated buildings, maintenance services, energy retrofits and equipment upgrades. Across the U.S., we provide comprehensive facility services consisting of mechanical construction, full HVAC service and maintenance, energy audits and retrofits, engineering and design build services, constructability evaluation, equipment and materials selection, offsite/prefab construction, and the complete range of sustainable building solutions and practices. Our primary customers include: (i) general contractors (‘‘GCs’’) and construction managers (‘‘CMs’’) who serve as the prime contractors in designing and constructing commercial buildings for public, institutional (not-for-profit) and private owners; and (ii) building owners themselves, for ‘‘owner-direct’’ work in which we contract directly with the owners.
 
The Company operates its business in two segments, (i) Construction, in which we generally manage large construction or renovation projects that involve primarily HVAC, plumbing, sheet metal fabrication and installation, specialty piping and electrical services, and (ii) Service, in which we provide facility maintenance or smaller general construction services primarily related to HVAC, plumbing or electrical services.
 
Our core market sectors for new construction, renovations, energy retrofits and maintenance services consist of the following:
 

• | Healthcare facilities; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Education including schools and universities; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sports & Amusement including sports arenas and related facilities; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transportation including passenger terminals and maintenance facilities for rail and airports; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Government facilities including federal, state and local agencies; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hospitality including hotels and resorts; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Corporate and commercial office buildings; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retail and mixed use; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Residential multifamily apartment buildings (excluding condominiums); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mission Critical, facilities including data centers; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Industrial manufacturing. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These sectors are projected by FMI (a leading third-party consultant to the engineering and construction industry) to experience strong growth through 2021, as noted in their Fourth Quarter 2017 Construction Outlook report. We are particularly focused on expanding our top four sectors noted above (Healthcare, Education, Sports & Amusement, and Transportation), leveraging our core areas of expertise and targeting projects with optimal risk/reward characteristics. Given recent developments and trends within the U.S. economy, we are also evaluating expansion and investment opportunities related to our Mission Critical and Industrial market sectors.


Our subsidiaries include Limbach Company LLC, which operates in regions that utilize organized union labor in New England, Eastern Pennsylvania, Western Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan and the Mid-Atlantic region; Limbach Company LP, operating in Southern California as a union operation; and Harper Limbach, our non-union, ‘‘open shop’’ division, which operates in Florida. Each of our operations (branches) provides design, construction and maintenance services in some or all of the HVAC, plumbing and electrical fields.
 
Among our core growth strategies is to offer design, construction and maintenance services of the full complement of HVAC, plumbing and electrical in all of our branch operations. We currently offer certain of these services in each of our branches, with electrical self-perform design, installation and maintenance services being offered primarily in our Mid-Atlantic branch. In addition, we also offer electrical services through installation subcontracting in our Ohio, Eastern Pennsylvania and Tampa branches. Over the coming years, we plan to further equip each of our branches to provide this combined offering. The approach of combined HVAC, plumbing and electrical is appealing to building owners who own and operate facilities with complex building systems.

Complex systems lend themselves to delivery methodologies that fit our integrated business model, including design/assist, design/build and integrated project delivery. We believe that few specialty contractors in the United States offer fully-integrated HVAC, plumbing and electrical services. We believe our integrated approach provides a significant competitive advantage, especially when combined with our proprietary design and production software systems. Our integrated approach allows for increased prefabrication of HVAC components, improves cycle times for project delivery and reduces risks associated with onsite construction.
 
In 2017, we were ranked the 10th largest mechanical contractor by Engineering News Record, up from 12th largest in 2016. For additional financial information about our operating segments, see Note 14 – Operating Segments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Customers
 Our customer base primarily consists of general contractors and construction managers, building owners or their representatives.
 
We believe we have strong relationships with a majority of national commercial GC/CMs. As one of our core risk management processes, we are selective in choosing to work with GC/CMs that have similar core values to ours, have a solid payment history, and who value our services and our reputation. Our top 9 core national GC/CM customers include the following (listed in alphabetical order):

• | Barton Malow 
--+-------------------
• | Clark Construction


• | Gilbane Building Company
--+-------------------------


• | Hensel Phelps Construction
--+---------------------------


• | Lend Lease
--+-----------


• | Skanska USA
--+------------


• | Suffolk Construction
--+---------------------


• | Turner Construction Company
--+----------------------------


• | Whiting Turner Contracting Company 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to these national GC/CM customers, our branches also maintain strong relationships with local and regional GC/CMs that fit our selection criteria. The Company had a single construction segment customer that accounted for approximately 15% of consolidated total revenues for the Successor year ended December 31, 2017. For the Successor period from July 20, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and for the Predecessor period from January 1, 2016 through July 19, 2016, this same construction segment customer represented approximately 24% and 11%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated total revenues. This resulted from a construction project which commenced in early 2016, of which the majority of the construction work was completed by the fourth quarter of 2017 with the contract to be completed in 2018.
 
Among our strategic goals is to grow our direct relationships with building owners. Building owners control capital and operating investments. This not only improves our position relative to major construction contracts with these owners, but also allows us to build long-term relationships around recurring maintenance services and smaller repair and installation projects. In our typical customer life cycle, we pursue opportunities to build or renovate facilities through a GC/CM. In most cases, this relationship is our sole entry into the building owner’s organization. However, we maintain hundreds of building owner relationships through our contracts for maintenance, smaller project renovations and energy retrofits. In our experience, when building owners are planning a project that involves predominantly HVAC, plumbing and/or electrical services, they often ask the GC/CM to assign the work directly to the Company. The following list includes some of our notable owner-direct relationships (listed in alphabetical order):
 

• | Abbott
--+-------


• | Amgen
--+------


• | Beaumont Health System
--+-----------------------


• | Carnegie Mellon University
--+---------------------------


• | Disney’s Imagineering
--+----------------------


• | Disney’s Facility Group
--+------------------------


• | Hospital Corporation of America
--+--------------------------------


• | PPG Industries 
--+----------------------
• | Siemens 
• | Tyco 
• | United Health Systems


• | University of Michigan

Construction Segment 
 
Construction Delivery Methods
 
We provide our Construction Segment services through a variety of project delivery options.
 
• Competitive Lump Sum Bidding (also referred to as ‘‘Plan & Spec’’ Bidding). Plan & Spec Bidding is a competitive bid process among multiple contractors bidding on completed design documents based on a lump sum price for delivery of the project. Price is the predominant selection criteria in this process.
 
• Design/Assist. Design/Assist is a process in which a specialty contractor is selected among competing contractors using best-value methodology. In best-value, a selection is made based primarily upon qualifications and project approach and secondarily on select cost factors. Cost factors are usually limited to a fixed fee and expense estimate and an estimate of the cost of work. With design/assist, the specialty contractor is contracted early in the design process to provide design and preconstruction input as needed to assist the customer in maintaining the established budget and completing design and drawings. This delivery option typically includes a guaranteed maximum price (‘‘GMP’’) on a fixed fee basis; however, sometimes the owner may offer a lump sum price to be established following the completion of design. Typically, once the specialty contractor is selected, there is no further competition. In some cases, the owner has the option of holding a competitive process at the end of design. On occasion, an owner may arrange for a cost-plus fixed fee arrangement exclusive of a GMP or lump sum arrangement.
 
• Integrated Project Delivery (‘‘IPD’’). Similar to design/assist, IPD is also a negotiated process; however, in the case of IPD, the entire project team, including the specialty contractors, is selected based on qualifications, team and approach. With IPD, the entire team is typically selected prior to the commencement of design and works together to establish a target budget and to execute the project within the agreed budget. On IPD projects, key specialty contractors (including HVAC, electrical and plumbing) are typically (but not always) parties to the same contract as the owner, GC/CM and design professionals, leading to a more equitable sharing of risk and profit.
 
• Design/Build. Design/Build projects may be secured on a best-value or qualification-based selection basis. A design/build contract may be delivered as a lump sum or GMP. With design/build, a prime GC/CM or other contractor will directly contract with a building owner. In many cases, the prime contractor will also procure specialty contracting services on a design/build lump sum or GMP basis. On occasion, we have the opportunity to provide Re-design/build services. With Re-design/build, we typically contract on a design/assist basis to participate during the design phase as described above. If the project’s HVAC, plumbing and/or electrical design is substantially over budget, then we may offer to re-design the project and bring the project back into budget. Higher margins may be earned on these contracts in comparison to design/assist contracts and can be executed with less risk due to having designed the systems.


• Performance Contracting. In select locations within specific vertical markets (such as education), we provide performance contracting to building owners. Performance Contracting involves the assessment of a building owner’s facilities and offers a proposal to reduce energy and operating costs over a specified period of time. Energy and operating savings are delivered through replacement of energy or cost inefficient systems and equipment with more efficient systems. The Company’s performance contracting team is able to deliver the capital improvements using our Design/Build platform and then, in some instances, guarantee the energy and operating systems over an agreed upon time-frame. In most cases, the building owner provides the financing for performance contracting. In other cases, we arrange for financing as part of the contract. Typically, performance contracts are offered by the Company on a negotiated basis. Negotiated contracts can provide for higher margins and lower risk than conventional projects. To assure our cost and operating saving guarantees, we require that we provide maintenance services during the term of the agreement.
Service Segment
 
Among our key business initiatives is the establishment of long-term relationships with building owners through maintenance agreements. We strive to convert construction projects into service business opportunities. We believe the Company has been successful in converting many of our construction projects into long-term maintenance contracts with building owners. However, a large portion of our maintenance services are delivered to building owners for whom we have not performed construction services. Accordingly, our service platform can operate on a standalone basis or in conjunction with our construction platform. We believe that our maintenance service offering provides a competitive advantage in the marketplace. In 2013, we launched a significant expansion to our existing service platform. Since then, our service revenue has grown by 137% to $94.4 million through December 31, 2017 and had grown by 106% to $82.2 million through December 31, 2016. Our service business builds long-term relationships through renewable, evergreen contracts and provides the following revenue and gross profit streams:

5
-

• Maintenance Contracts. Through evergreen contracts, we provide maintenance services for HVAC, electrical and/or plumbing systems and equipment.
 
• Service Project Contracts. Smaller than typical construction projects, this work is contracted directly with a building owner. On projects that are predominantly HVAC, plumbing, and/or electrical in scope, the Company may act as the ‘‘prime’’ general contractor.
• Spot Work. ‘‘Spot’’ Work is construction and/or service work performed on an emergency basis for building owners who are already under contract with the Company for maintenance and/or construction work.
• Water Treatment. In select branch locations, we offer specialized water treatment services to building owners who may need to rehabilitate poorly maintained chillers and related equipment.
 
• Automatic Temperature Controls (“ATC”). We provide design, installation and maintenance for specialized ATC systems through our maintenance and construction platforms to building owners and GC/CM customers.
 
• Special Projects Divisions (“SPD”). In addition to our major construction projects and our maintenance services, we provide construction services through our special project divisions, known as SPD. Each of our nine branch locations offers SPD services. SPD services are typically less than $1 million in construction cost and have short durations and limited scopes of work. These projects are primarily secured through lump sum competitive bids, though on occasion these projects may be negotiated. When design is required for an SPD project, Limbach Engineering & Design Services (“LEDS”) supports the contract. Although SPD work is normally performed on projects under $1 million, the margins earned on these projects can be substantially higher than larger construction projects. Typically, the project duration for SPD services is shorter than that of large construction projects, and can sometimes be completed in less than 30 days.
 
Due to our successful contractual relationships with building owners earned through maintenance services, we are well positioned with those owners when they are ready to initiate major capital construction projects. As a result, our maintenance services often lead to and help drive and support the growth of our HVAC, plumbing and electrical construction business.
 
Seasonality
 
Severe weather can impact our operations. In the northern climates where we operate, and to a lesser extent the southern climates as well, severe winters can slow our productivity on construction projects, which shifts revenue and gross profit recognition to a later period. Our maintenance operations may also be impacted by mild or severe weather. Mild weather tends to reduce demand for our maintenance services, whereas severe weather may increase the demand for our maintenance and spot services.
Engineering and Shared Services
 
Located in Orlando, Florida, LEDS provides our in-house engineering capabilities. LEDS provides professional engineering, energy analysis, estimation, and detail design services to building owners and clients in both our construction and service segments. This capability distinguishes us from competitors that more typically provide design/build services by hiring external engineering companies. By providing professional engineering through LEDS, we deliver integrated design/build services to the market. By bundling engineering services with construction, our clients avoid the costly expense of separate engineering services.
 
The core capability of LEDS is professional engineering. Combined throughout the Company, we maintain 17 registered professional engineers on staff, who are supported by a staff of approximately 25 estimators and designers. LEDS acts as the engineer of record for projects where we serve as a design/build specialty contractor. LEDS engineers have experience in healthcare, institutional, commercial, multi-family residential, hospitality, and industrial projects. Our operations in all of our regions have complete access to a large staff of professional engineers and designers through LEDS.

LEDS controls the development and maintenance of our Limbach Modeling and Production System (‘‘LMPS’’). LMPS is a comprehensive database, workflow, and reporting system used by LEDS and all of our branches to design, estimate, plan, and track construction projects. We believe LMPS is unique in the industry and provides a competitive advantage by providing highly technical services in-house in a cost effective manner. LMPS is a Building Information Modeling (‘‘BIM’’) tool that allows us to construct mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineering (MEP) systems in a virtual environment, avoid conflicts in the field, eliminate rework caused by coordination issues, maximize the use of off-site prefabrication of assemblies, and capture installation productivity and construction progress. We utilize LMPS beginning with the original engineering concept and throughout the construction process to continuously monitor progress and avoid wasted efforts. Many others in the industry expend additional costs to third parties for redrawing and remodeling effort to achieve the same results.
 
Backlog
 
Our construction backlog was $426.7 million and $390.2 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Projects are brought into backlog once we have been provided written confirmation of award and the contract value has been established. At any point in time, we have a substantial volume of projects that are specifically identified and advanced in negotiations and/or documentation, however those projects are not booked as backlog until we have received written confirmation from the owner or the GC/CM of their intention to award us the contract and have directed us to begin engineering, designing, incurring construction labor costs or procuring needed equipment and material. Our construction projects tend to be built over a 12- to 36-month schedule depending upon scope and complexity. Most major projects have a preconstruction planning phase which may require months of planning before actual construction commences. We are occasionally employed to deliver a “fast-track” project, where construction commences as the preconstruction planning work continues. As work on our projects progresses, we increase or decrease backlog to take into account our estimate of the effects of changes in estimated quantities, changes in conditions, change orders and other variations from initially anticipated contract revenues, and the percentage of completion of our work on the projects. We estimate that 67% of our construction backlog as of December 31, 2017 will be recognized as revenue during 2018.
 
Our service backlog was $34.7 million and $44.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  These amounts reflect unrecognized revenue expected to be recognized over the remaining terms of our service contracts and projects.  We estimate that 94.4% of our service backlog as of December 31, 2017 will be recognized as revenue during 2018.

Competition 
 
The HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and maintenance industry is highly competitive and the geographic markets in which we compete have numerous companies that provide similar services. Factors influencing our competitiveness include price, reputation for quality, ability to reduce customer costs, experience and expertise, financial strength, surety bonding capacity, knowledge of local markets and conditions, and customer relationships. Competitors tend to be regional firms that vary in size and depth of resources. There are, however, significant national competitors with greater national presence and breadth of expertise than that of the Company.
Materials & Equipment 
 
We purchase materials, including sheet metal, steel and copper piping, electrical conduit, wire and other various materials from numerous sources. We also purchase equipment from various manufacturers. The price and availability of materials and equipment may vary from year to year due to market conditions and industry production capacities. We do not foresee a lack of availability of any materials or equipment in the near term.
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 480 full-time salaried employees, comprised of project managers, estimators, superintendents and engineers who manage fully equipped crews in our construction business and office staff. We also had approximately 1,100 craft employees, some of whom are represented by various labor unions. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees. We have developed strong partnerships with local unions to have access to an experienced, talented craft workforce.
Government and Environmental Regulations 
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. We also are subject to compliance with numerous other laws and regulations of federal, state, local agencies, and authorities, including those relating to workplace safety, wage and hour, and other labor issues (including the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state laws), immigration controls, vehicle and equipment operations and other aspects of our business. In addition, a relatively limited number of our construction contracts are entered into with public authorities, and these contracts frequently impose additional requirements, including requirements regarding labor relations and subcontracting with designated classes of disadvantaged businesses. A large portion of our business uses labor that is provided under collective bargaining agreements. As such, we are subject to federal laws and regulations related to unionized labor and collective bargaining (including the National Labor Relations Act).
 
We continually monitor our compliance with these laws, regulations and other requirements. While compliance with existing laws, regulations and other requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, and we are not aware of any proposed requirements that we anticipate will have a material impact on our operations, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change or that compliance will not otherwise adversely affect our operations in the future. In addition, while we typically pass any costs of compliance on to our customers under the applicable project agreement, either directly or as part of our estimate depending on the type of contract, there can be no assurance that we will not incur compliance expenses in the future that materially adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or “CERCLA”, and comparable state law, impose strict, retroactive, joint and several liability upon persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.
