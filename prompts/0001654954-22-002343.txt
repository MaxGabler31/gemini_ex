BUSINESS

Overview

Zomedica Corp, (“Zomedica”, “we”, “us” or “the Company”) is a veterinary health company creating products for companion animals by focusing on the unmet needs of clinical veterinarians. Our mission is to enrich the lives of the animals we love and the people that care for them by providing products and technologies that improve patient care and enhance practice health. Our product portfolio includes innovative diagnostics and therapeutic medical devices that emphasize patient health and enhancing practice economics. 

We are currently commercializing two discrete platforms - our TRUFORMA® platform, comprising point-of-care diagnostic products for disease states in dogs and cats, and our PulseVet® platform, which provides for treatment of musculoskeletal issues in horses and small animals.

 Dogs and cats commonly suffer from adrenal disorders and thyroid disease, including hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. We believe that diagnostic tests are vital for identifying these disorders in sick patients as well as for screening apparently healthy patients. In certain cases, multiple assays must be performed to reach a definitive diagnosis of a specific disease or condition. Clinical veterinarians often do not have access to the equipment and assays to perform this testing at the point-of-care. As a result, certain tests must be sent to a reference lab, resulting in delay in diagnosis and treatment, and depriving clinical veterinarians of potential testing revenue.

Through our TRUFORMA® platform, we are focused on the development and commercialization of diagnostic instruments and related assays for use at the point-of-care that provide reference lab accuracy, thereby enabling practitioners to diagnose and treat diseases sooner.

Our Customer Appreciation Program (“CAP”) provides interested customers with a TRUFORMA® instrument pursuant to a written agreement under which the customer agrees to purchase assay cartridges for use on that instrument. Our intent not only is to sell cartridges to be used on these Instruments, but also to establish an installed base of TRUFORMA® instruments so that assays available in the future can be added to their then existing usage, similar to a razor/razor blade model. 

Through our PulseVet platform, we are the world leader in electro-hydraulic shockwave technology for the treatment of a wide variety of conditions in horses and small animals. Our technology is indicated for conditions including osteoarthritis, tendon and ligament healing, bone healing, chronic pain relief and wound healing. 

Market Opportunity

In March of 2021, the American Pet Product Association (“APPA”) estimated that the pet products industry had sales of over $100 billion in 2020. Veterinary care and product sales accounted for $31.4 billion of such sales, representing a 7.2% increase year over year. The APPA projected above average growth of 5.8% in expected revenue in 2021, well above the historical average of 3 to 4% per year.

According to a 2021 Mordor Intelligence study, the veterinary diagnostics market had a market size of approximately $4.8 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow to approximately $12.6 billion by 2026, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11.7%. According to the study, the factors driving this market growth include increased animal healthcare expenditure, rising incidence of zoonotic diseases, and the growing number of veterinary practitioners as well as disposable income in developing regions.

According to a study completed in 2021, The Business Research Company estimates that the global veterinary medical equipment market is expected to grow from approximately $1.8 billion in 2020 to approximately $2.1 billion in 2021. According to the Business Research Company, the veterinary medical equipment market is expected to reach approximately $2.7 billion in 2025, representing a CAGR of approximately 6%.

We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has positively affected the relationship people have with their pets. In June of 2020, the APPA reported in its COVID-19 Pulse Survey that greater than 70% of pet owners surveyed were spending more time with their pets. We believe that new pet adoptions and fostering has increased, with USA Today recently reporting many shelters experiencing a significant reduction in their shelter populations.

Currently, approximately two thirds of U.S. households own pets, with dogs and cats making up the vast majority of the pet population. According to an LEK Consulting April 2020 consumer survey, U.S. dog and cat ownership has increased approximately 4%, during the COVID-19 pandemic. With more than 91% of pet-owning families considering their pets to be ‘members of the family’, consumers are finding ways to enhance their pet’s lives through increased access to healthcare and premium services. International markets represent additional market opportunity as they exhibit similar trends as the U.S. In 2019 veterinary care made up 25.2% of the $95.7 billion U.S. Pet industry. The number of veterinarians in the U.S. has steadily grown over the past decade and they are eager to try new clinically effective and cost efficient tools from device companies to treat their growing patient populations.

The US equine healthcare market is expected to grow steadily for the foreseeable future, driven largely by an increase in expenditures per horse. The curtailing of horse shows and races in 2020 due to the pandemic temporarily diminished the market’s revenue for that year but eased COVID-19 restrictions and strong pent up demand has accelerated the industry’s performance through 2021. Strong economic growth supporting consumer confidence and increasing disposable income is expected to drive demand for luxury goods and expensive hobbies. Rising demand for show horses and racehorses are projected to increase breeding, thus the total numbers of horses for the coming decades 

We believe that these factors along with humanization of pets, longer pet lifespans and the emotional benefits of pets and support animals have and will continue to contribute to an increase in spending on pet healthcare. 

Development of Companion Animal Diagnostics and Medical Devices

The development of companion animal diagnostics and medical devices continues to evolve. We believe that this evolution focuses on the following:


· | Enhanced capability to detect the frequency of occurrence and severity of diseases and conditions that impact companion animals;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increased accuracy and faster means to obtain test results;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | Wider availability of new diagnostic tools; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
· | Development and availability of new treatment options; and


· | Enhanced economic benefits for veterinarians.
--+----------------------------------------------


Compared to human diagnostic and medical device development, the development of companion animal diagnostics and medical devices is generally faster and less expensive since it typically requires smaller clinical studies with fewer subjects. We believe that the lower cost of developing companion animal diagnostics and medical devices enables us to develop and commercialize products less expensively than those intended for human use.

Product Pipeline

TRUFORMA® Platform

Our TRUFORMA® platform uses patented Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) technology to provide a non-optical and fluorescence free system for the detection of disease at the point of care. We believe that the BAW technology enables us to develop products that enable precise and repeatable testing of companion animals at the point-of-care with results provided during a typical veterinary appointment.

Working with our development partner, Qorvo Biotechnologies, LLC., (“Qorvo”), our strategic focus is on the commercialization of our diagnostic instrument and initial assays, the development of additional assays for the detection of thyroid disorders in dogs and cats and adrenal disorders in dogs, development of three assays, cobalamin, cPL (canine pancreatic lipase), and folate, for the diagnoses of canine gastrointestinal issues, and additional assays for various disease states in the future. We are currently marketing our diagnostic instrument and related assays for canine and feline TSH, canine and feline tT4 and canine cortisol. 

The combined dynamic range of the canine and feline TRUFORMA® TSH assay is 0.008-10.0 ng/mL compared to the Siemens IMMULITE® Canine TSH assay dynamic range of 0.03-12 ng/mL. This assay will enable quantification of samples with low levels of TSH, which is necessary to discriminate normal and hyperthyroid feline samples. Verification data comparing the canine TRUFORMA® TSH assay to the Siemens IMMULITE Canine TSH assay showed high correlation (R=0.99). We believe that our assay is the only commercially available feline optimized TSH assay.

The combined dynamic range of the canine and feline TRUFORMA® tT4 assay is 0.45-30.0 µg/dL compared to the Siemens IMMULITE tT4 assay dynamic range of 0.5-15 µg/dL. Verification data comparing the canine and feline TRUFORMA® tT4 assay to the Siemens IMMULITE Canine tT4 reference lab assay showed high correlation (R=0.94).

The dynamic range of the canine TRUFORMA® cortisol assay is 0.35-24.0 µg/dL compared to the Siemens IMMULITE Cortisol assay dynamic range of 1-50 µg/dL. Verification data comparing the canine TRUFORMA cortisol assay to the Siemens IMMULITE Cortisol reference lab assay showed high correlation (R=0.97).

The product development cycle for new assays begins with the feasibility phase, followed by the design, verification and validation (University & Clinic) phases, and then launch.

The feasibility, design and verification phases of the TRUFORMA® ACTH assay have been completed, with validation efforts currently underway.  We believe that the availability of canine eACTH at the point of care has the potential to change the way veterinarians manage the two most common canine adrenal diseases, Cushing’s and Addison’s, by providing accurate results more quickly.

The feasibility phase of the canine TRUFORMA® fT4 assay has been completed with design efforts underway. We believe that this will be the first fT4 assay available at point-of-care intended to be used for the rapid diagnosis of canine hypothyroidism.

In addition to thyroid and adrenal disease panels, we have initiated development of assays targeting non-infectious gastrointestinal disorders. The feasibility phase of the canine TRUFORMA® cobalamin and canine TRUFORMA folate assays are underway. These assays are not commercially available at the point-of-care and it usually takes days to send samples and receive results from a reference laboratory. We expect to begin development of a cPL assay in the near future. We believe that the availability of these three assays at the point-of-care will allow veterinarians to make diagnostic decisions faster, leading to more timely initiation of treatment. 

 We intend to continue development of new assays, both for equine indications of our current and planned assays, and for various additional disease states affecting canine, feline, and equine patients in the future. Our plan is to build a pipeline of new assays for use in the existing TRUFORMA® instrument, which can both expand the potential revenue generation per instrument by existing customers and provide the basis for new clinics to acquire a TRUFORMA instrument.

PulseVet Shock Wave Platform

Our PulseVet products use electrohydraulic shock wave generation technology in which a submerged high voltage spark gap is used to generate an expansive plasma bubble in front of a focusing reflector.  The resultant high pressure acoustic energy wave is directed and focused into the treatment animal to induce therapeutic healing effects.

The PulseVet business operates using a ‘razor/razor-blade’ model in which the consumables are required to be refurbished after approximately 50 procedures. Customers purchase a ProPulse® generator unit as well as a handheld therapy delivery device called a “Trode.” Each Trode has a defined duty cycle of 50,000 individual pulses, which will deliver approximately 50 therapy sessions depending on how many pulses the veterinarian prescribes for a particular treatment session. Once a Trode has reached the end of its duty cycle, the customer returns the unit to us, where it is refurbished and resold.

PulseVet’s shock wave therapy systems are capable of treating a broad range of musculoskeletal issues, such as broken bones, tendonitis, and torn ligaments. As PulseVet has continued to develop its technology, the number of potential indications has increased, and we intend to continue to develop new indications in the future.

Because of the high power requirements of the therapy and the previous need to anesthetize smaller companion animals prior to treatment, PulseVet has historically focused on the U.S. equine market. We believe PulseVet has built strong industry relationships in some of the largest and most significant equine practices in the U.S., as well as relationships with highly regarded university educators and researchers. PulseVet’s business also targets customers in the U.K. and Western Europe. 

Small Companion Animal Market

Previously, the need for sedation when using shock wave therapy for small animals was a barrier to broad adoption in the small animal market.  In September 2021 PulseVet introduced the X-Trode, a new handpiece which eliminates the need for sedating small animal patients in the significant majority of cases.   We intend to promote the X-trode product in the small animal veterinary market, and expect that customer experiences and more robust data from pending clinical studies will drive awareness and sales of shock wave therapy from use of the X-Trode in the small animal space.

We intend to conduct several clinical studies of shock wave therapy, including:


· | a study designed to measure efficacy in treating osteoarthritis (“OA”) in small animals with the X-Trode. Animals will randomly be divided into two groups, with and without shock wave treatment, and will be monitored for pain, functionality, and disease progression for 12 months. This study is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2022 and is expected to be completed approximately two to three years after commencement; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | a study designed to measure efficacy in treating pulmonary diseases in horses. Historically, shock wave therapy has not been applied to the lungs. However, recent studies by PulseVet and others have shown that the lungs can be treated safely. This study will examine the efficacy of treating exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage in horses. This study is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2022 and is expected to be completed three years after commencement.


We are also participating in studies that are being conducted by independent investigators, including: 


· | a randomized, double blinded, cross-over study of 24 dogs that previously had Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy (“TPLO”) surgery and are currently presenting with OA. The animals will be treated with shock wave therapy and monitored for pain and functionality for 12 months. This study began in the first quarter of 2022 and is expected to be completed two years after commencement; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | a study designed to measure the effect of shock wave therapy on Nocita injections. Nocita is a bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension used to control post-surgical pain. A study was previously carried out showing the effect of shockwave on Nocita liposomes using the PulseVet traditional trode. The same study will be carried out with the X- Trode to compare the output of the X- Trode with the traditional probe. This study is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2022 and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2022;
· | a study to document small animal tolerance of the X -Trode vs. the traditional trode. This study is examining pain caused by treatment with the X -Trode compared to a traditional trode in dogs without sedation. This study began in the first quarter of 2021 and is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2023.

License Agreements

TRUFORMA® Platform

In November 2018, we entered into a development and supply agreement with Qorvo focused on bringing Qorvo’s piezo-electric BAW sensor to the veterinary health sector. Under the terms of this agreement, we have exclusive, global rights to develop and market Qorvo's investigational point-of-care diagnostic platform for veterinary use during the term. Under this agreement, we have been collaborating with Qorvo on the development of our TRUFORMA instrument and the related diagnostic assays. The joint development work initially targeted five assay cartridge candidates to detect thyroid and adrenal disorders in dogs and cats, and in 2020 we expanded the assays to include a canine gastrointestinal panel with three assays. Under this agreement, Qorvo developed our TRUFORMA® instrument and our initial three assays and is responsible for the development of the additional assays.  We agreed to pay for the associated non-recurring engineering costs of up to $0.5 million per initial assay cartridge and the instrument and are responsible for the validation of the assay cartridges and the instrument. Qorvo has agreed to supply us, on an exclusive basis, with the instruments and the related assay cartridges to be developed under the agreement pursuant to a rolling forecast, subject to specified minimum purchase requirements, at prices specified in the agreement. We are responsible for the marketing and sale of the disposable assay cartridges and instruments.

The agreement, which is exclusive worldwide in the practice of veterinary medicine for the health and wellbeing of any non-human animal, has an initial term of ten years (subject to early termination and extension in certain circumstances).

We paid Qorvo $1.0 million and issued to Qorvo unregistered common shares having a value of $4.4 million, consisting of an aggregate of 2,565,789 common shares with an ascribed price of $1.52 per share. We paid an additional $5 million of milestone payments in the first quarter of 2019. In the second and third quarters of 2020, we paid our final two milestone payments to Qorvo of $3 million and $2 million, respectively. In connection with the agreement, we entered into a registration rights agreement providing Qorvo with certain registration rights with respect to the common shares to be issued by us under the agreement.

Legacy Programs 

As a result of an internal strategic view, at this point in time we have decided to focus our development and commercialization efforts on our TRUFORMA® platform and our PulseVet shock wave technology.  We believe this narrowed focus will enable us to capitalize on our core strengths and to accelerate the commercialization of these existing platforms.

In May 2018, we entered into a development, commercialization and exclusive distribution agreement with Seraph Biosciences, Inc. ("Seraph") a human biomedical device company. Under the terms of this agreement, we have exclusive global veterinary industry rights, except for (i) food safety or animal product or byproduct applications and (ii) animal import/export control applications, to develop and market a novel pathogen detection system in the form of a point-of-care diagnostic instrument. The agreement covers development and validation of our fecal/urine pathogen detection assays. We are responsible for development and validation, and their associated costs. In the event that we choose to commercialize this technology, Seraph will supply us, on an exclusive basis, with the hardware platform, associated software and the consumables to be developed under the agreement, pursuant to a rolling forecast, at prices specified in the agreement, and we would be responsible for the marketing and sale of the hardware platform, associated software and the consumables. The agreement has a term of seven years (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances) and automatically renews for additional one year terms thereafter unless one of the parties elects to terminate the agreement.

We paid Seraph up-front fees of $0.5 million and issued to Seraph unregistered common shares having a value of approximately $1.2 million, consisting of an aggregate of 641,717 common shares at an ascribed price of $1.9479 per share. Seraph is entitled to additional payments for development costs. In the event that we choose to commercialize this technology, Seraph will be entitled to receive up to an additional $6 million, $3.5 million payable in cash and $2.5 million payable in additional unregistered common shares, upon the achievement of a series of staged, specified milestones, including completion of laboratory studies and field studies, production and commercial shipment of products. Seraph is entitled to certain registration rights with respect to the common shares to be issued by us under the agreement. In addition, we have agreed to pay Seraph license fees based on a percentage of gross profit from commercial sales of the product.

In January 2017, we entered into a collaborative research agreement with Celsee, Inc., or Celsee, a developer of diagnostics for the detection and quantification of cells and other markers. Subsequent to this agreement, in December 2017, we entered into a license and supply agreement with Celsee for exclusive global rights to develop and market Celsee’s liquid biopsy platform. The agreement with Celsee covers the development and commercialization of liquid biopsy assays and related consumables for the detection of cancer in companion animals.

We paid Celsee up-front fees of $0.5 million and issued to Celsee unregistered common shares having a value of approximately $0.2 million, consisting of an aggregate of 112,314 common shares at an ascribed price of $2.2259 per share. We issued Celsee an additional 657,894 unregistered common shares having a value of $1.0 million at an ascribed price of $1.52. upon the achievement of specified milestones, namely, completion of product development and upon completion of manufacturing milestones. All milestone payments to Celsee were satisfied as of December 31, 2019.

In January 2020, we amended and restated the Celsee agreement to acknowledge the completion of the initial development work and to provide for definitive supply and pricing terms for the liquid biopsy instrument and related consumables. In March 2021, we amended the Celsee agreement to clarify certain exclusionary provisions related to rights granted to us.

Under the terms of the restated agreement, we continue to have veterinary oncology care exclusive global rights to develop and market Celsee’s liquid biopsy platform for use by veterinarians as a cancer diagnostic.

In the event that we choose to commercialize this technology, Celsee will supply us on an exclusive basis with the assays and the consumables for the products to be developed under the agreement pursuant to a rolling forecast to be provided by us at prices specified in the agreement, and we would be responsible for the marketing and sale of the assays and the related consumables. The agreement, which is exclusive in the field of veterinary cancer diagnostic applications, has a term of five years (subject to termination in certain circumstances) and automatically renews for additional two year terms thereafter (subject to either party determining not to renew).

PulseVet Platform

The technology used in our PulseVet products is licensed to us pursuant to a license agreement with SANUWAVE, Inc. Under the license agreement, we have a worldwide, exclusive license under specified patents to develop and commercialize products in the veterinary field.  In 2019, the license was converted to an irrevocable perpetual, paid-up, worldwide exclusive license in exchange for a one-time payment.

Research and Development

We engage in development work on our diagnostic platforms in conjunction with our strategic partners. We use a contract research organization, or CRO, to assist in performing our research and development activities. In connection with these activities, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses. Our research and development expenses were approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and approximately $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Sales and Marketing

We market our TRUFORMA® platform and related assays in the U.S. through our own sales force, which included 19 sales representatives, including inside sales, Professional Services Veterinarians, Area Sales Directors and our Vice President of Sales on December 31, 2021. Our TRUFORMA® products are generally sold directly to veterinary professionals or through on-line orders. 

Our TRUFORMA® platform strategy is to build an installed base of instruments through our CAP in order to drive demand for our assays, and to bring new assays to market as rapidly as possible, both to increase revenue and to build the value proposition for the TRUFORMA® instrument. Consistent with this strategy, we are currently offering to provide TRUFORMA® instruments to veterinarians at no cost in exchange for a commitment by the customer to utilize the assays. We believe that this program will enable us to add future assays more quickly to the platform, with limited additional customer acquisition or training costs or added service burden.


10


Since our acquisition of PulseVet in October 2021, we have focused on cross training our existing sales representatives and the PulseVet sales representatives so that the entire sales team can market both product lines simultaneously. 

In September 2021, PulseVet launched its X-Trode product for use in the small animal market. We believe that the X-Trode will significantly expand the market opportunity for the use of shock wave technology by small animal veterinarians and appeal to the same customers targeted by our small animal oriented field sales force.

PulseVet provides a warranty to the customer in the event of product defects. The warranty period can vary from 12 months to 24 months and covers the cost of shipping a temporary unit while the customer's unit is being serviced.

Manufacturing

Under our license and supply agreements, Qorvo is responsible for the manufacture and supply of our TRUFORMA® instrument and the related assays and has primary responsibility for assuring that all products will be manufactured in accordance with applicable laws and meet all agreed upon specifications. Each quarter, we provide Qorvo with a forecast, identifying the assays required for the subsequent three months. 

Our PulseVet products are assembled by us from readily available components. We assemble and distribute our products in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. We assemble and refurbish our Trodes in our facility in Alpharetta, Georgia. We use a contractor to assemble and distribute our product in Japan.

Although most components essential to our PulseVet business are generally available from multiple sources, we obtain printed circuit boards (“PCBs”) from two manufacturers. 

Intellectual Property

We intend to rely primarily upon a combination of in-licensed exclusive rights, patents, proprietary know-how, and confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, methods and other technologies and to preserve any trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. 

Our TRUFORMA® instrument and the related assays, as well as the PulseVet technology are dependent on intellectual property developed by our strategic partners and licensed to us. We do not own the intellectual property rights that underlie these technology licenses. Our rights to use the technology we license are subject to the negotiation of, continuation of and compliance with the terms of our licenses.  In certain instances, we have continuing sale rights after the termination of the applicable license agreement.

We currently own one issued patent and have filed four additional U.S. patent applications, two of which are also Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) applications for international protection. These patents and applications are focused on inventions related to parasite detection, urinary tract infection detection, or identification of cancer cells in blood. While we are not currently developing products that use these inventions, we will continue to pursue these filings and maintain an active patent portfolio.

We depend upon the skills, knowledge, and experience of our management personnel, as well as that of our other employees, advisors, consultants and contractors, none of which are patentable. To help protect our know-how, and any inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into customary confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

Competition

In the diagnostic market, our potential competitors include large veterinary diagnostics companies, small businesses focused on animal health, and reference laboratory services provided by academic institutions and in-clinic product providers. These competitors include Idexx Laboratories, Inc., Antech Diagnostics, a unit of VCA Inc., Heska Corporation, Bionote USA Inc. and Zoetis Inc, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Abaxis, Inc.

In the shock-wave market we face competition from laser devises offered by entities such as Companion Animal Health, a division of LiteCure, LLC, Summus Medical Laser, LLC and ELvation Medical GmbH.

Many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially more financial, technical, and human resources than we do. Many also have far more experience in the development, manufacture, regulation and worldwide commercialization of animal diagnostics and medical devices. We also expect to compete with academic institutions, governmental agencies and private organizations that are conducting research in the fields of animal diagnostics and animal medical devices. If such competing products are successfully commercialized before our products, or if our intellectual property protection fails to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products, we may be unable to effectively compete in the markets in which we participate.

Government Regulation

There are no requirements for U.S. Food and Drug Administration, ("FDA") pre-market approval of medical devices intended for animal use. Animal medical devices and diagnostic aids are, however, subject to the general provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ("FDC Act") that relate to misbranding and adulteration. For example, an animal medical device may be considered misbranded if the labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use by the layperson or an animal device is misbranded if it is dangerous to animal or human health when used in the manner prescribed, recommended, or suggested in labeling. The FDA relies on veterinarians and other users to report unsafe animal medical devices.
Employees

As of December 31, 2021, we had 47 employees. Of our employees, 4 are engaged in research and development activities, 22 are engaged in business development, sales and marketing activities, and 21 are engaged in corporate and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.
