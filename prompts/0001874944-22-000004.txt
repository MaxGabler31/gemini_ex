Item 1. Business
Our Company
We are reimagining the vacation rental experience for homeowners and guests through our end-to-end technology platform.
We are the leading vacation rental management platform in North America with over five million Nights Sold during the year ended December 31, 2021. Our integrated technology and operations platform optimizes vacation rental income and home care for homeowners, offers guests a seamless, reliable, and high-quality experience with exceptional service, and provides distribution partners with valuable and high-performing home listings. Our global marketplace aggregates approximately 37,000 exclusive listings in over 400 destinations throughout North America, Belize, and Costa Rica. Our guests are able to search, discover, and book properties on vacasa.com, our Guest app, and on the booking sites of over 100 distribution partners including Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated approximately $1.9 billion in GBV from approximately five million Nights Sold.
Our business model is simple and is based on shared success. We collect nightly rent on behalf of homeowners and earn the majority of our revenue from homeowner commissions and service fees paid by guests when a vacation rental is booked directly on vacasa.com, our Guest app, or on the sites of one of our distribution partners. Because we are vertically-integrated, our listings are predominately exclusive to us and we are able to capture all of the bookings for properties on our platform and a greater portion of each transaction.
Since our inception, we have focused primarily on the supply side of the market and on homeowners, who hold the keys to the next wave of expansion as demand for vacation rentals continues to grow. Booking channels such as Airbnb, Booking.com, Google, and Vrbo have historically had more focus on the demand side of the market and collectively drive hundreds of millions of site visits each month. As a result, we believe demand often exceeds available vacation rental home listings in the right location, on the right day, with the right features. 
Through our integrated technology and operations platform, we unlock new supply and increase the availability of vacation rental home listings for guests to discover and book. Our comprehensive set of capabilities is designed to remove barriers to renting vacation and second homes by solving critical challenges for homeowners such as listing creation and merchandising, pricing optimization, multi-channel distribution and demand generation, seamless home care, insights and analytics, smart home technology, and customer support. For homeowners already renting, we aim to drive significant incremental income and transform their vacation homes into high performing vacation rentals.
Our global marketplace connects guests with the homes we bring onto our platform. Our listings are aggregated on vacasa.com and on the sites of over 100 major demand channels, allowing for efficient distribution and discovery that is vital for a thriving marketplace. As a result, we are able to capture demand wherever it exists and connect it with our leading vacation rental home listings. Our marketplace avoids the capital intensity and asset-based limitations of owning the underlying real estate and we aim to bring new supply online in a matter of days. Our direct channel, which includes our booking site and Guest app, has become our leading source of guest demand, driving approximately 30% of GBV for the year-ended December 31, 2021.
Developments in Our Business
Reverse Recapitalization
On July 28, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to become a publicly traded company through a business combination with TPG Pace Solutions Corporation, a Cayman Islands exempted company (TPG Pace).
On December 6, 2021, we consummated (the Closing) the business combination (the Business Combination) contemplated by that certain business combination agreement, dated as of July 28, 2021 (as amended, the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among TPG Pace, Vacasa Holdings, Turnkey Vacations, Inc., a Vacasa Holdings equity holder (TK Newco), certain other Vacasa Holdings equity holders (together with TK Newco, the “Blockers”), us, and certain other parties pursuant to which, among other things, TPG Pace merged with and into us, following which the separate corporate existence of TPG Pace ceased 
and we became the surviving corporation. The transactions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement are further described in Note 3, Reverse Recapitalization to our consolidated financial statements.
TurnKey Acquisition
On April 1, 2021, we acquired the operations of TurnKey Vacation Rentals (TurnKey), a provider of property management and marketing services for residential real estate owners in the United States (the TurnKey Acquisition). The TurnKey Acquisition advances our strategy to create a premium standard for vacation rentals. The acquisition also increased our market density in regions where we have existing operations and expands our footprint into several other top vacation rental destinations. See Note 4, Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Since early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. In certain markets, vacation homes on our platform and attractions within the local market have been subject to shifting government mandates or guidance regarding COVID-19 restrictions. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have continued to impact our business in a number of ways. Our priority has continued to be the health, safety, and support of our employees, homeowners, and guests. We have also taken measures to manage the financial impacts of the pandemic to our business. Refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Recent Developments" for a detailed discussion about the impacts of COVID-19 to our business.
The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact us over the longer term remains uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, including potential new strains or variants of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, including mobility restrictions, the effectiveness of vaccines, and the impact of these and other factors on travel behavior in general and on our business. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address and comply with government regulations and maintain the safety of our employees and guests.
Our Growth Strategy
We are in the early phases of capturing our market opportunity. Key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Optimize existing supply. We expect to continue to innovate on our platform to expand our technology advantage, improve our operational efficiency, grow Nights Sold, and reduce homeowner churn. Utilizing our artificial intelligence (AI) driven technology, we have demonstrated improvements in reducing owner holds, increasing revenue per home through yield management, and improving churn over time and plan to continue to do so. 
•Grow supply in existing markets. We intend to grow our footprint and increase density in existing markets to achieve further economies of scale, primarily using our individual approach. We plan to continue to leverage our proprietary data and AI engine to drive intelligent supply acquisition by identifying, predicting, and targeting the highest value properties in a given area. We aim to make the entire supply acquisition process frictionless and plan to continue to invest in our sales team and in homeowner marketing to enable us to drive growth.
•Expand into new domestic markets. We aim to establish footholds in new domestic markets, primarily using our portfolio approach, which is our primary strategy for entering new markets. Our portfolio approach capitalizes on the footprint of highly fragmented, professionally managed, local property portfolios and allows us to port dozens of existing vacation rental homes to our platform simultaneously to build our local market presence at a faster rate. 
•Expand our range of homeowner services. We intend to leverage our deep homeowner relationships and trusted position in the home to monetize adjacent services and expand our suite of product offerings. Our expanded range of homeowner services may include multiple service levels for homeowners who want or need assistance with select aspects of our end-to-end offering. We believe these services also have the potential to funnel more homeowners into our core product over time.
•Elevate the guest experience. We plan to elevate the guest experience with enhanced technology and services. We intend to continue to invest in our existing technology including our Guest app and smart home technology, to further serve and delight guests. We plan to seamlessly integrate expanded in-destination services for guests, including concierge services, customized local guides, and in-destination experiences. We aim to further invest in our brand to increase awareness among new guests to build brand affinity, engagement and repeat usage.
•Expand into international markets. We currently have an international footprint in Canada, Mexico, Belize and Costa Rica. Over time, we intend our new market expansion to also include selective entry into attractive international markets, primarily in Europe and the Americas. 
Our Platform and Product Offerings
Our platform delivers a comprehensive offering to homeowners looking to rent their vacation homes, guests looking to experience the potential that vacation rentals can offer, and guides all aspects of our local operations.
Offerings for Homeowners
We have designed our platform with a homeowner-first approach. Our homeowner offering includes products and services designed to enable homeowners to maximize rental income from their properties while having the peace of mind that their property is cared for. Our homeowner offering includes:
•Property setup and listing optimization. We swiftly handle the comprehensive steps needed to allow a homeowner's home to be listed for rent. We offer design resources, professionally written descriptions, high definition photography and 3D Tours in order to maximize guest appeal. We also offer feature and amenity recommendations based on our trove of proprietary data. Once a listing is live, we handle all aspects of marketing, calendar management and guest interaction.
•Demand generation. Our proprietary software automatically syndicates listings across our own scaled direct booking site and on the booking sites of over 100 third party distribution partners, including Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo to capture demand wherever it exists. We seamlessly integrate and syndicate our listings across our site and those of our distribution partners. We have also built tools to allow for granular modifications on listings or prices by channel. We have built a proprietary universal channel management system that takes the details associated with a given home and shares the listing instantly with the appropriate partner sites. We overlay our partner optimization dashboard that allows us to run testing for optimization across our partner network, understand pricing elasticity by partner and work to optimize contributions regardless of channel.
•Dynamic pricing. We strive to maximize the total rental revenue for our homeowners. We use AI to predict how and when we can deliver the maximum yield for homeowners and price the home accordingly. To achieve this optimization we adjust rental rates millions of times a day across all our channels based on proprietary data, a guest's itinerary, a home's availability, and real-time booking dynamics. Our data scientists and machine learning engineers continually test for optimization, iterate, and release new algorithms in an effort to improve revenue per available night. 
•Tax & compliance support. We simplify compliance and tax-related tasks for homeowners. We collect and remit transient occupancy taxes (TOT) through our platform and assist with filing necessary permits for vacation rental properties in certain jurisdictions.
•Real estate analytics. We offer homeowners advanced analytics based on the wealth of proprietary and industry data we have around vacation rental activity. We provide rental projections to help buyers make informed decisions about potential purchases.
•Homeowner dashboard and mobile app. Homeowners can easily access all their booking, payment, and performance details in a simple, intuitive interface on our homeowner portal or via our mobile app. Information is personalized and 24/7 support is readily accessible.
•End-to-end property care. We deliver comprehensive home care including housekeeping, maintenance, inspection and other service-related needs to deliver peace of mind to homeowners and provide a consistent, high-quality experience to guests.
Offerings for Guests
For guests, our offerings provide a frictionless way to search, discover, transact and experience Vacasa listings. Our guest offerings include:
•Direct booking site. Our booking site serves as our own scaled demand channel. Approximately 30% of GBV was generated through our direct channel, which includes our booking site and Guest app, in the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2021.
•Payment capabilities. Guests can book instantly on our website or mobile app, all in a secured environment. We offer multiple payment options, including payment plans offered through our partnership with Affirm.
•24/7 support. Guests can access our support staff around the clock. Our dedicated customer support team is available 24/7 and is easily accessible via phone, vacasa.com, or our Guest app.
•Smart home technology. Our smart home technology comprises a host of devices including keyless locks, Wi-Fi routers, and noise monitoring technology. The integration of these devices and features deliver compelling value for guests and homeowners.
•Guest app. Our Guest app is designed to drive strong engagement, satisfaction, extended stays and return stays. Our powerful Guest app enables a frictionless experience with a comprehensive suite of features for before, during and after their stay. Guests are able to search, book and pay for their stay through the app. Leading up to the trip we prepare them by sending important details about the home and their stay. Upon arrival at the home, the Guest app facilitates access to the property, Wi-Fi connection and our 24/7 support.
Technology Utilized by our Local Operations Teams
Our focused teams who perform home care, home optimization, field operations and sales help us establish deep relationships with homeowners and guests by directly providing service to the home and homeowners and guests in over 400 destinations and are key to delivering an enhanced level of service at the local level. They leverage our technology to deliver efficiency and consistency. Underpinning our local operations teams is our proprietary technology that guides all aspects of home care. These capabilities include:
•HomeCare Hub. Our HomeCare Hub is a proprietary software tool purpose-built for vacation rentals and powered by AI. Our HomeCare Hub allows us to optimize staffing, assignments, dispatching and workflows across all of our local markets. Operations managers are able to monitor all the homes in their portfolio 24/7 with bi-directional flow of information from the property. Furthermore, we have built API integrations to vendors to maximize efficiency in the process. Our AI-driven software solution is designed to continuously improve and enhance our operational effectiveness over time.
•Field application. Our field application is leveraged by all of our home care staff, maintenance personnel and local managers. It is directly tied into our HomeCare Hub software tool, which enables seamless coordination between managers, contractors and field personnel. Our proprietary application provides visibility to employees on assigned tasks or open tickets. The field application is used in a myriad of ways, such as a guest check-out status to facilitate accelerated cleans and post-cleaning photo submissions for real-time inspection approval. Over time, we have been able to automate more of the operational playbook and leverage AI and machine learning to drive significant efficiency gains at the market level.
•Ticketing system and time tracking. We provide comprehensive management of all employee activity on our platform. This includes a ticketing system with detailed real-time tracking for every homeowner or guest-related task. Our local operations teams can clearly see and manage their workflow. Additionally, employees can utilize our system to easily track their time and productivity.
•Home-based instructions and direction. Our field application provides our local home care teams with directions to homes, estimated clean times and security codes for entry.
•Smart home technology. Smart home technology, such as smart locks, can greatly improve our operational efficiency. For example, local staff do not need to visit homes to change lock box codes or replace lost keys, and certain locks can be programmed to trigger notifications so we know when a guest has checked in and, more importantly, when they have checked out. We can then utilize this data to inform our scheduling algorithms, which improves the efficiency of our local teams running home care.
Our Development and Technology Infrastructure
We have a research and development culture that rapidly and consistently delivers high-quality enhancements to the functionality, usability, and performance of our platform. We have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers, designers, product managers, and data scientists whose expertise spans a broad range of technical areas. We embrace a DevOps culture whereby engineering teams both build systems and manage them in production. We organize our tech organization into cross-functional agile delivery teams, integrating product management, engineering, data science, design, and system operations. We utilize a microservices architecture, which allows these teams to release updates rapidly and independently. We focus on creating rich customer experiences while also architecting for massive scale. Our web-based offerings are responsive, mobile-enabled, and operating system-agnostic. We build native iOS and Android applications for our guests and owners for a more polished experience.
In November 2021, we launched a new Vacasa Homeowner app through which homeowners are able to monitor reservations and track home maintenance as well as review the financial performance of their Vacasa vacation rental home. The Vacasa Homeowner app allows homeowners to receive push notifications when their home receives a booking and to view booking rates for their home at any given time. The Vacasa Homeowner app adds to our growing technology ecosystem and was designed to help homeowners stay more connected to their vacation rental home and increase transparency for homeowners into our services.
Sales and Marketing
Our marketing strategy primarily relies on performance marketing, which we complement with engagement marketing and brand marketing. We deploy performance marketing strategies through digital and offline channels to drive additional traffic from high-intent prospective guests. Engagement marketing initiatives include email and other outbound communications to ensure that we retain high-value homeowners and guests. Brand marketing increases awareness among potential homeowners and guests, helping them understand the benefits of renting their home through Vacasa and of booking and experiencing a Vacasa property. 
In addition to performance, engagement, and brand marketing, we engage in public relations and communications activities to strengthen our brand and enable us to be less reliant on performance marketing. Our communications team works across press and policy channels to share timely and important news about Vacasa. They also oversee the execution of a consumer, product, corporate, and policy communications plan that supports our brand strategy.
We deploy focused outbound sales efforts targeted at homeowners of properties we predict will be high-value listings on our platform. Once prospects are identified, our sales development representatives and sales executives work to convert homeowners to our platform. We have both local and central sales executives. Our local sales executives have crucial area relationships and deep referral networks that bolster our efforts.
Our Distribution Partners
As part of our multi-channel distribution strategy, we have established relationships with over 100 online booking sites, including Airbnb, Booking.com and Vrbo, pursuant to which we make Vacasa-listed properties available for booking by guests through these partners’ online platforms. Bookings through our distribution partners accounted for approximately 70% and 65% of our GBV during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Our agreements with our distribution partners typically provide either that (1) the partner will receive a commission on bookings made through the channel transactions (with the rate varying by partner) or (2) we will pay the partner a fixed subscription fee, typically on an annual, per-listing basis. Certain partners may charge guests additional fees directly.
Human Capital
Our People
As of December 31, 2021, we employed a total of approximately 8,200 team members globally. Our dedicated local operations teams work directly with our homeowners to provide comprehensive vacation rental management services and exceptional care for our guests. Our field teams are firmly backed by our central team employees who work in our offices or remotely. This group is composed of engineers, product managers, marketers, operations leads, finance professionals, human resources, and legal personnel.
We are committed to hiring a diverse workforce. We seek to foster an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome to be their authentic selves and all voices are heard — an environment that is aligned with our values and that reflects our global community.
Our Culture
At Vacasa, we believe that a great vacation has the power to be life-changing. We are reimagining the vacation rental experience for homeowners and guests through our end-to-end technology platform. We will do this by powering the modern way to own, care for, and enjoy vacation homes.
Our people are the heart of our business, our most valuable asset, and the foundation of our culture. When you put a group of passionate professionals together—who set out each day to enhance the lives of our homeowners, guests, partners, and most importantly each other—the result is a culture of service and respect, always focused on solutions and improvement.
Vacasa’s culture has grown and evolved along with its people. We started in 2009 with one home and a small, scrappy team. Today, we manage approximately 37,000 homes with a team of experts across the travel and hospitality industry. Even with all of this scale, we still maintain the entrepreneurial spirit that drove Vacasa in its early days. We hold ourselves accountable to the values we’ve grown into as a company, which guide our decision making:
•Innovation: We look to the future and anticipate what’s next.
•Accountability: We are committed, purposeful and intentional. We take aim and follow through with decisive action.
•Growth: We set the bar high and push ourselves and our teammates to continually expand, improve and progress.
•Empathy: We listen closely, engage thoughtfully and cultivate lasting relationships built on mutual benefit and trust.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Our culture is also one of inclusion. We actively work to dismantle inequities within our policies, systems, programs and services to ensure that Vacasa is a space where no one feels the need to edit their identity. We continuously aspire to be a more equitable, safe, and welcoming work environment for all of our team members, and a better advocate to the communities we serve.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment. As we seek to expand our geographic footprint and grow our business globally, we face competition in attracting and retaining homeowners and guests.
Homeowners. Homeowners can either self-manage or use local property management businesses to market and care for their homes. Homeowners who self-manage are able to list on sites such as Airbnb and Vrbo, and may choose to leverage additional software tools to handle aspects of the process such as pricing or scheduling. We compete for homeowners based on many factors, including the volume of bookings generated by guests on our platform and those of our distribution partners; ease of onboarding onto our platform; the service fees and commissions we charge; the owner protections we offer, such as our insurance programs; and the strength of our brand. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also competed based on our cancellation and shut down policies in response to regulatory actions.
Guests. We also compete to attract guests to our platform. Guests have a wide range of options for finding and booking accommodations, and as such, we compete with other forms of accommodations including hotels, other vacation rental companies, and serviced apartment providers, both online and offline. We also compete for traffic and demand generation through our direct booking channel with Airbnb, Google, Booking Holdings (including the brands Booking.com, KAYAK, Priceline.com and Agoda.com), Expedia Group (including the brands Expedia, Vrbo, Hotels.com, Orbitz and Travelocity), Tripadvisor, Trivago, AllTheRooms.com and regional booking sites and online travel agencies, and to a lesser degree, urban rental sites such as Sonder, and niche programs such as Inspirato. We compete for guests based on many factors, including the uniqueness and quality of our homes and the availability of homes; the value and all-in cost of our offerings relative to other options, our brand; and the ease of use of our platform. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also competed based on the availability of homes close to where guests live, as well as the perceived safety and cleanliness of the listings on our platform.
We believe we compete favorably on the basis of the key competitive factors noted above. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater financial, technical and other resources, including greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The business and industry in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors.”
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an important component of our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, domain names, copyright, know-how and trade secrets, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2021, we held two U.S. patent applications, which were published in April 2021 and remain in progress, and one patent registration acquired through the TurnKey Acquisition. While we believe our patent applications and registration are important to our competitive position, we do not believe any single patent application or registration is material to our business as a whole. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
As of December 31, 2021, we owned 53 U.S. and 64 international (across 54 countries) registered or pending trademarks, including “Vacasa,” “Vacation Rentals Made Easy,” “Vacation Differently” and related logos and designs. We also own several domain names that we use in or relate to our business, including “vacasa.com” and other country code top level domain name equivalents.
We rely on trade secrets and confidential information to develop and maintain our competitive advantage. We seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information through a variety of methods, including confidentiality procedures and non-disclosure agreements with employees, third parties, and others who may have access to our confidential or proprietary information. We also require our employees to sign invention assignment agreements with respect to inventions arising from the course of their employment, and we restrict unauthorized access to our proprietary technology. In addition, we have developed proprietary, AI-driven software that is protected through a combination of copyright and trade secrets.
Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that the measures we take will be effective or that our intellectual property will provide any competitive advantage. We cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our currently pending or any future applications or that any of our issued patents will adequately protect our proprietary technology. Our intellectual property rights may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Furthermore, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, as a result, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. In addition, while we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, we cannot guarantee that these measures will not be circumvented, or that all applicable parties have executed confidentiality or invention assignment agreements. In addition, such agreements can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies should any such breach occur. Accordingly, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently discovered by competitors. For more information regarding the risks related to intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Information Technology, Data Security and Data Privacy.”
Data Privacy and Security
The protection of identifiable information about individuals, or personal data, that we collect is important for ensuring trust with our stakeholders. In the course of operations, we collect and process a variety of personal data from interactions with customers and visitors, individuals’ use of our websites and/or applications, social media, and advertisements, or individuals’ communications with us relating to any services we offer. We also collect personal data from job applicants, employees and independent contractors, and employees of certain companies with which we work.
We store, protect, use and transmit personal data in accordance with our online privacy policy and internal data security and data handling policies and procedures, in addition to a variety of industry-standard technical, administrative, and physical measures. We also employ a variety of measures designed to comply with our legal obligations in relation to the collection and processing of personal data and promote the use of fair information practice principles to protect personal data.
Such measures include, but are not limited to: specifying collection and processing purposes; restricting the use of personal data to specified purposes; minimizing the collection and retention of personal data beyond what is required for our operations; anonymizing, pseudonymizing, or otherwise obfuscating certain personal data; encrypting personal data; administering privacy awareness training; inventorying personal data processing activities; managing service providers processing personal data on our behalf; and embedding privacy into the design of our products and services.
We are subject to a variety of data privacy and security laws and regulations across multiple jurisdictions where we have operations. Such laws and regulations include, but are not limited to:
United States
•Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)
•Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
•Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM)
•California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)
•Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act and state-level Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices (UDAP) laws

•The Privacy Act 2020
The laws and regulations included above set forth a variety of compliance requirements related to the collection and processing of personal data. In order to ensure compliance with such requirements, we maintain and continuously develop a cross-functional and interdisciplinary privacy program that covers the following areas: data subject (consumer) rights; training and awareness; vendor management; personal data inventorying and mapping; retention and destruction; privacy impact assessments; privacy policy management; and incident management.
Regulations
We are subject to a wide variety of laws, rules, and regulations enforced by both governments and private organizations. Many of these rules and regulations are constantly evolving. If we are unable to comply with them, we could be subject to civil and criminal liabilities, revocation, or suspension of our licenses or other adverse actions. We may also be required to modify or discontinue some or all of our offerings, and our ability to grow our business and our reputation may be harmed. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of our regulatory risks.
Short-Term Regulatory Considerations in the Markets in which we Operate
We operate in hundreds of locations across the United States, with varying sets of rules and regulations associated with each state, county, city, town, township, or village. We typically focus our operations in markets whose jurisdictions allow for un-hosted, non-owner occupied short-term rentals, and avoid major cities, such as San Francisco and Denver, that only allow “homeshares,” which are rentals of the owner’s primary residence. Occasionally, however, acquisitions of other management companies bring with them a small number of rentals that are subject to these primary residence rules.
The owners of the properties we manage are ultimately responsible for obtaining and maintaining applicable permits, licenses, and tax registrations, and for complying with local zoning restrictions as well as restrictive covenants and homeowner association bylaws. We often assist with permitting, licensing, and taxation to the extent we are legally able, and work hard to verify and help ensure compliance with state and local laws for all of our homes. When violations occur, we strive to move quickly to assist owners in correcting them and abide by the decisions of government officials.
Some states require short-term rentals to be offered through a licensed real estate broker. Where applicable, we offer and operate rentals through a licensed subsidiary.
Real Estate Regulatory Considerations for our Business Operations
As discussed above, our vacation rental property management operations are considered real estate services in certain states. In addition, our buy/sell real estate brokerage services, offered separately in select states, are considered real estate services. Real estate service providers must be licensed at a brokerage or broker level, and are commonly referred to as a real estate brokerage. Real estate brokerages are licensed at the state level and are primarily regulated by state level agencies dedicated to real estate or licensing services.
State Regulation
Real estate brokerage licensing laws vary widely from state to state. All entities and individuals providing brokerage services must be licensed separately in each state where they operate. Generally, a corporate entity must obtain a firm level license, although in some states the licenses are personal to individual brokers and an entity is associated with the individual broker’s license. Where a firm license is obtained, an individual broker is appointed as the principal broker. The term of art for the principal broker varies from state to state. Licensed agents or salespersons must also obtain a license and affiliate their license under a firm or a principal broker to engage in licensed real estate brokerage activities.
The principal broker in each state is responsible for compliance with licensing laws and for actively supervising the licensed brokerage activities of all its licensees within the state. All licensed market participants, whether individuals or entities, must also comply with a state’s real estate licensing laws and regulations. The licensing laws and regulations vary in each state, but generally detail minimum duties, obligations, and standards of conduct for licensees include requirements related to contracts, disclosures, record-keeping, local offices, handling of trust funds, agency representation, advertising regulations, and fair housing regulations. In each of the states where our operations require, we have designated a properly licensed principal broker and, as required, we also hold a corporate real estate broker’s license.
Federal Regulation
Several federal laws and regulations govern the real estate brokerage business, including federal fair housing laws such as the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA), and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, or FHA. RESPA restricts kickbacks or referral fees that real estate settlement service providers such as real estate brokers, title and closing service providers and mortgage lenders may pay or receive in connection with the referral of settlement services. RESPA also requires certain disclosures regarding certain relationships or financial interests among providers of real estate settlement services.
RESPA provides a number of important exceptions that allow for payments or referral commissions to be made and received between licensed real estate brokers and for market-rate compensation payments between service providers for services actually provided. RESPA is administered by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB. The CFPB has applied a strict interpretation of RESPA and related regulations, and often enforces these regulations in administrative proceedings. Consequently, industry participants have modified or terminated a variety of historical business practices to avoid the risk of protracted and costly litigation or regulatory enforcement.
The FHA prohibits discrimination or any preference in housing because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status and disability. The FHA applies to real estate brokers and licensees involved in the purchase or sale of homes and to the non-transient rental of homes. The FHA also applies broadly to many forms of advertising and communications, including Multiple Listing Service (MLS) listings, websites and social media postings.
Local Regulation
In addition to state and federal regulations, residential transactions may also be subject to local regulations. These local regulations generally require additional disclosures by parties or licensees in a residential real estate transaction, or the receipt of reports or certifications, often from the local governmental authority, prior to the closing or settlement of a real estate transaction. Local regulations also may expand those protected from housing discrimination laws by protecting additional classes of people and providing additional fair housing laws.
MLS Rules
Our real estate buy/sell brokerages are also subject to rules, policies, data licenses, and terms of service established by over 50 MLSs of which we are a participant. These rules, policies, data licenses and terms of service specify, among other things, how our licensees may access and use MLS data and how MLS data must be displayed on websites we control or that our licenses maintain. The rules of each MLS to which we belong can vary widely and are complex.
National Association of REALTORS (NAR)
NAR, as well as state and local associations of REALTORS, have codes of ethics and rules governing members’ actions in dealings with other members, clients, and the public. Our licensees and licensed entities must comply with these codes of ethics and rules as a result of membership in these organizations.
Seasonality
Our overall business is seasonal, reflecting typical travel behavior patterns over the course of the calendar year. In addition, each market where we operate has unique seasonality, events, and weather that can increase or decrease demand for our offerings. Certain holidays can have an impact on our revenue by increasing Nights Sold on the holiday itself or during the preceding and subsequent weekends. Typically, our second and third quarters have higher revenue due to increased Nights Sold. Our GBV typically follows the seasonality patterns of Nights Sold. Our operations and support costs also increase in the second and third quarters as we increase our hourly staffing to handle increased activity on our platform in those periods.
In 2020, we saw COVID-19 affect the historical seasonality pattern in our revenue, our key business metrics of Nights Sold, GBV, and GBV per Night Sold, and our non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA. These changes were primarily the result of shelter-in-place orders and changing travel preferences relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect this impact on typical seasonality to continue as long as COVID-19 continues to impact travel restrictions and customer preferences globally.
