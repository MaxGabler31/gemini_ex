 ﻿
 Partnership History 
 ﻿
 We are a master limited partnership formed by our parent on March 2, 2015. On July 1, 2015, we completed our IPO of 11,500,000 common units representing limited partner interests. Our common units are traded under the symbol “GPP” on Nasdaq. After completing the IPO, in addition to the interests of BlendStar, we obtained the ethanol storage and leased railcar assets and liabilities previously owned and operated by our parent, in a transfer between entities under common control.
 ﻿
 On January 1, 2016, we acquired the ethanol storage and leased railcar assets of the Hereford, Texas and Hopewell, Virginia ethanol production facilities from our sponsor in a transfer between entities under common control. The assets were recognized at historical cost and reflected retroactively along with related expenses for periods prior to the effective date of the acquisition, subsequent to the initial dates the assets were acquired by our sponsor, on October 23, 2015, and November 12, 2015, for Hopewell and Hereford, respectively. There were no revenues related to these assets for periods before January 1, 2016, when the amendments to our commercial agreements related to the drop down became effective.
 ﻿
 On September 23, 2016, we acquired the ethanol storage assets located in Madison, Illinois, Mount Vernon, Indiana and York, Nebraska related to three ethanol plants, which occurred concurrently with the acquisition of these facilities by Green Plains from subsidiaries of Abengoa S.A. The transaction was accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control and the assets were recognized at the preliminary value recorded in Green Plains’ purchase accounting. No retroactive adjustments were required.
 ﻿
 On August 13, 2018, the requirements under the partnership agreement for the conversion of all of the outstanding subordinated units into common units were satisfied. Accordingly, all of the 15,889,642 outstanding subordinated units were converted into common units on a one-for-one basis.
 ﻿
 On November 15, 2018, our parent closed on the sale of three of its ethanol plants located in Bluffton, Indiana, Lakota, Iowa, and Riga, Michigan to Valero Renewable Fuels Company, LLC (“Valero”). Correspondingly, the storage assets located adjacent to such plants were sold to our parent for $120.9 million. As consideration, we received from our parent 8.7 million Green Plains units and a portion of the general partner interest equating to 0.2 million equivalent limited partner units to maintain the general partner’s 2% interest. These units were retired upon receipt. In addition, we also received cash consideration of $2.7 million from Valero for the assignment of certain railcar operating leases.
 ﻿
 On November 15, 2018, our parent announced the permanent closure of its ethanol plant located in Hopewell, Virginia. The closure did not affect our quarterly storage and throughput minimum volume commitment with Green Plains Trade or the current transload operations at that location.
 ﻿
 Overview
 ﻿
 Green Plains Partners provides fuel storage and transportation services by owning, operating, developing and acquiring ethanol and fuel storage facilities, terminals, transportation assets and other related assets and businesses. We were formed by Green Plains, a vertically integrated ethanol producer, to support its marketing and distribution activities as its primary downstream logistics provider.
 ﻿
 We generate a substantial portion of our revenues under fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade for receiving, storing, transferring and transporting ethanol and other fuels, which are supported by minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments. We do not take ownership or receive any payments based on the value of ethanol or other fuels we handle. As a result, we do not have direct price exposure to fluctuating commodity prices.

 As of December 31, 2018, our parent owns a 49.1% limited partner interest in us, consisting of 11,586,548 common units, a 2.0% general partner interest and all of our incentive distribution rights. The public owns the remaining 48.9% limited partner interest. The following diagram depicts our simplified organizational structure at December 31, 2018:

 Our Assets and Operations
 ﻿
 Ethanol Storage.  Our ethanol storage assets are the principal method of storing ethanol produced at our parent’s ethanol production plants. Most of our parent’s ethanol production plants are located near major rail lines. Ethanol can be distributed from our storage facilities to bulk terminals via truck, railcar or barge.    ﻿
 In the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold the storage assets associated with the ethanol plants located in Bluffton, Indiana, Lakota, Iowa, and Riga, Michigan to our parent. We currently own or lease 32 ethanol storage facilities and approximately 49 acres of land. Our storage tanks are located at or near our parent’s 13 operational ethanol production plants in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee, and Texas, as well as our parent’s non-operational ethanol production plant in Virginia. 
 ﻿

Our ethanol storage tanks have combined storage capacity of 31.9 mmg and aggregate throughput capacity sufficient to support our parent’s revised annual production capacity of 1,123 mmgy. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our parent operated its ethanol production facilities at an average daily production capacity of approximately 75% resulting in ethanol storage and throughput of 1,135 mmgy. The following table presents additional ethanol production plant details by location:

  ﻿
 Terminal and Distribution Services. We own and operate seven fuel terminals in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Kentucky and Oklahoma with combined total storage capacity of approximately 7.3 mmg and access to major rail lines. We also own approximately five acres of land and lease approximately 18 acres of land where our fuel terminals are located. Ethanol and other products are transported to our terminals primarily by rail, and shipped from our terminals by truck to third parties, including refiners, blenders and other obligated and non-obligated parties. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the aggregate throughput at these facilities was approximately 249.9 mmg.    ﻿
 The following table presents additional fuel terminal details by location:

﻿ | | | | 

  ﻿
 (1) Access to our six other fuel terminal facilities is available from BNSF, KCS, Canadian National, Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and CSX.
 ﻿
 Transportation and Delivery. Ethanol deliveries to distant markets are shipped using major U.S. rail carriers that can switch cars to other major railroads or barge delivery to national or international ports. Our railcar volumetric capacity is used to transport product primarily from our ethanol storage facilities and third-party production facilities to other fuel terminals, including our own, international export terminals and refineries located throughout the United States. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we assigned certain railcar operating leases associated with the ethanol plants in Bluffton, Indiana, Lakota, Iowa, and Riga, Michigan to Valero. Currently, our leased railcar fleet consists of approximately 2,840 railcars with an aggregate capacity of 85.2 mmg. We expect our railcar volumetric capacity to fluctuate over the normal course of business as our existing railcar leases expire and we enter into or acquire new railcar leases.
     We also own and operate a fleet of 19 trucks and tankers that transport ethanol and other products. 
 ﻿
 Segments 
 ﻿
 Our operations consist of one reportable segment and are conducted solely in the U.S. See Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for financial information about our operations and assets.

Our Relationship with Green Plains
 ﻿
 Our parent is a diversified commodity processor with operations related to ethanol production, grain handling and storage, cattle feedlots, and commodity marketing and logistics services. The company is one of the largest ethanol producers in North America with 13 operating dry mill plants, with the capacity to produce approximately 1.1 billion gallons of ethanol per year.
 ﻿
 We benefit significantly from our relationship with our parent. Our assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol our parent produces. Our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade account for a substantial portion of our revenues.
 ﻿
 Our parent has a majority interest in us through the ownership of our general partner and a 49.1% limited partner interest, as well as all of our incentive distribution rights. We believe our parent will continue to support the successful execution of our business strategies given its significant ownership in us and the importance of our assets to Green Plains’ operations.
 ﻿
 We have entered into several agreements with our parent, which were established in conjunction with the IPO, including: an omnibus agreement; a contribution, conveyance and assumption agreement; an operational services and secondment agreement; and various commercial agreements described below. For all material agreements and subsequent amendments required to be filed, please refer to Item 15 – Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules.
 ﻿
 Commercial Agreements with Affiliate
 ﻿
 A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, our primary customer, including a (1) fee-based storage and throughput agreement, (2) Birmingham terminal services agreement, (3) fee-based rail transportation services agreement and (4) various other transportation and terminal services agreements. 
 ﻿
 Minimum Volume Commitments. Our storage and throughput agreement and certain terminal services agreements with Green Plains Trade are supported by minimum volume commitments. Our rail transportation services agreement is supported by minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments. Green Plains Trade is required to pay us fees for these minimum commitments regardless of actual throughput volume, capacity used, or the amount of product tendered for transport, which is intended to provide some assurance that we will receive a certain amount of revenue during the terms of these agreements. These arrangements are intended to provide stable and predictable cash flows over time.
 ﻿
 Storage and Throughput Agreement. Under our storage and throughput agreement, as amended, Green Plains Trade is obligated to deliver a minimum of 235.7 mmg of product per calendar quarter at our storage facilities. In addition, Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay $0.05 per gallon on all volume it throughputs associated with the agreement. If Green Plains Trade fails to meet its minimum volume commitment during any quarter, Green Plains Trade will pay us a deficiency payment equal to the deficient volume multiplied by the applicable fee. The deficiency payment may be applied as a credit toward volumes delivered by Green Plains Trade in excess of the minimum volume commitment during the following four quarters, after which time any unused credits will expire. 
 ﻿
 On November 15, 2018, as part of the sale of ethanol storage assets associated with the ethanol plants located in Bluffton, Indiana, Lakota, Iowa, and Riga, Michigan, the storage and throughput agreement was amended to reduce the minimum volume commitment from 296.6 mmg of product per calendar quarter to 235.7 mmg. In addition, we agreed with our parent to extend the storage and throughput agreement with Green Plains Trade an additional three years to June 30, 2028. The storage and throughput agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 360 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term. 
 ﻿
 Terminal Services Agreement. Under our terminal services agreement for the Birmingham facility, Green Plains Trade is obligated to throughput a minimum volume commitment of approximately 2.8 mmg per month of ethanol and other fuels, equivalent to 33.2 mmgy, and pay associated throughput fees, as well as fees for ancillary services through December 31, 2019. The agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 90 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term. Several of our other terminal services agreements with Green Plains Trade also contain minimum volume commitments with various remaining terms. 
 ﻿

Rail Transportation Service Agreement. Under our rail transportation services agreement, as amended, Green Plains Trade is obligated to use the partnership to transport ethanol and other fuels from receipt points identified by Green Plains Trade, to nominated delivery points, and pay an average monthly fee of approximately $ 0.0186 per gallon for all railcar volumetric capacity provided over the remaining life of the agreement. The minimum railcar capacity commitment we provide to Green Plains Trade for our leased railcar fleet is currently 85.2 mmg and the weighted average remaining term of all railcar lease agreements is 2.9 years. At December 31, 2018, the remaining term of our rail transportation services agreement was 6.5 years. The rail transportation services agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 360 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term.  
 ﻿
 Green Plains Trade is also obligated to use the partnership for logistical operations management and other services related to railcar volumetric capacity provided by Green Plains Trade and pay a monthly fee of approximately $0.0014 per gallon for these services. In addition, Green Plains Trade reimburses us for costs related to: (1) railcar switching and unloading fees; (2) increased costs related to changes in law or governmental regulation related to the specification, operation or maintenance of railcars; (3) demurrage charges, except when the charges are due to our gross negligence or willful misconduct; and (4) fees related to rail transportation services under transportation contracts with third-party common carriers. Green Plains Trade frequently contracts with us for additional railcar volumetric capacity during the normal course of business at comparable margins.
 ﻿
 We lease our railcars from third parties under multiple operating lease agreements with various terms. The minimum take-or-pay capacity commitment under the rail transportation services agreement is closely aligned with our existing railcar lease agreements. As a result, when current railcar lease agreements expire, the volumetric capacity provided under the rail transportation services agreement declines accordingly. We enter new lease agreements to replace scheduled capacity reductions under the rail transportation services agreement or provide incremental capacity as requested by Green Plains Trade. We do not speculate on capacity by leasing additional railcars that are not covered by the rail transportation services agreement. 
 ﻿
 Trucking Transportation Agreement. Under our trucking transportation agreement, Green Plains Trade pays us to transport ethanol and other fuels by truck from identified receipt points to various delivery points. Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay a monthly trucking transportation services fee equal to the aggregate amount of product volume transported in a calendar month multiplied by the applicable rate for each truck lane, which is defined as a specific route between point of origin and point of destination. Rates for each truck lane are negotiated based on product, location, mileage and other factors, including competitive factors. At December 31, 2018, the remaining term of our trucking transportation agreement was five months. The trucking transportation agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 30 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term. 
 ﻿
 Competitive Strengths
 ﻿
 We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to successfully execute our business strategies:
 ﻿
 Stable and Predictable Cash Flows. A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, including a storage and throughput agreement, rail transportation services agreement, terminal services agreement and other transportation agreements. Our storage and throughput agreement and certain terminal services agreements are supported by minimum volume commitments, and our rail transportation services agreement is supported by minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments. Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay us fees for these minimum commitments regardless of actual throughput or volume, capacity used or the amount of product tendered for transport. 
 ﻿
 Advantageous Relationship with Our Parent. Our assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol our parent produces, and the related agreements with Green Plains Trade include minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments. Furthermore, as general partner and owner of a 49.1% limited partner interest in us, as well as all of our incentive distribution rights, our parent directly benefits from our growth, which provides an incentive to pursue projects that directly or indirectly enhance the value of our business and assets. This can be accomplished through organic expansion, accretive acquisitions or the development of downstream distribution services. Under the omnibus agreement, we are granted the right of first offer, for a period of five years from the date of the IPO, on any ethanol storage asset, fuel terminal facility or transportation asset our parent owns, constructs, acquires or decides to sell.
 ﻿

Quality Assets. Our portfolio of assets has an expected remaining weighted average useful life of approximately 12 years. Our ethanol storage and fuel terminal assets are strategically located in thirteen states near major rail lines and barge service, which minimizes our exposure to weather-related downtime and transportation congestion and enables access to markets across the United States. Given the nature of our assets, we expect to incur only modest maintenance-related expenses and capital expenditures in the near future. 
 ﻿
 Financial Strength and Flexibility. Our borrowing capacity and ability to access debt and equity capital markets provide financial flexibility necessary to achieve our organic and acquisition growth strategies.
 ﻿
 Proven Management Team.  Each member of our senior management team is an employee of our parent who also devotes time to manage our business affairs. We believe the commercial, operational and financial expertise of our senior management team, which averages approximately 25 years of industry experience, allows us to successfully execute our business strategies.
 ﻿
 Business Strategy
 ﻿
 We believe ethanol could become an increasingly larger portion of the global fuel supply driven by volatile oil prices, heightened environmental concerns, energy independence and national security concerns. We intend to further develop and strengthen our business by pursuing the following growth strategies: 
 ﻿
 Generate Stable, Fee-Based Cash Flows.  A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade. Under these agreements, we do not have direct exposure to fluctuating commodity prices. We intend to continue to establish fee-based contracts with our parent and third parties that generate stable and predictable cash flows.
 ﻿
 Grow Organically.  We will collaborate with our parent and other potential third parties to identify opportunities to develop and construct assets that provide us long-term returns on our investments. Plant expansion that increases our parent’s production capacity also increases the annual throughput volumes at our facilities. Capital expenditures associated with expansion are minimal since our ethanol storage facilities have available capacity to accommodate volume growth. 
 ﻿
 Acquire Strategic Assets. We intend to pursue strategic acquisitions independently and jointly with our parent to grow our business. Our parent has a proven history of identifying, acquiring and integrating assets that are accretive to its business. Under the omnibus agreement, we have a right of first offer, for a period of five years from the date of the IPO, on any fuel storage, terminal or transportation asset our parent owns, constructs, acquires or decides to sell. In addition, we intend to continually monitor the marketplace to identify and pursue assets that complement or diversify our existing operations, including fuel storage and terminal assets in close proximity to our existing asset base.
 ﻿
 Development of Downstream Distribution Services.  We will continue to use our logistical capabilities and expertise to further develop downstream ethanol distribution services that leverage the strategic locations of our ethanol storage and fuel terminal facilities.
 ﻿
 Conduct Safe, Reliable and Efficient Operations. We are committed to maintaining safe, reliable and environmentally compliant operations and conduct routine inspections of our assets in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We seek to improve our operating performance through preventive maintenance, employee training, and safety and development programs. 
 ﻿
 Recent Developments
 ﻿
 The following is a summary of our significant developments during 2018. Additional information about these items can be found elsewhere in this report or in previous reports filed with the SEC.
 ﻿
 Completion of Construction and Commencement of Operations – NLR Energy Logistics LLC
 ﻿
 During the first quarter of 2018, construction of the NLR Energy Logistics LLC ethanol unit train terminal in Little Rock, Arkansas was completed at a total cost of approximately $7.0 million. Operations commenced at the beginning of the second quarter and we received our first unit train in July 2018.

Termination of DKGP Energy Terminals LLC Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with AMID Merger LP
 ﻿
 On February 16, 2018, we partnered with Delek Logistics Partners LP to form DKGP Energy Terminals LLC, a 50/50 joint venture, to acquire and manage light products terminal assets in Texas and Arkansas. In conjunction with the formation of the joint venture, DKGP executed a membership interest purchase agreement with AMID Merger LP, to acquire all of the membership interests of AMID Refined Products LLC (“AMID”) for approximately $138.5 million. Due to regulatory obstacles, on August 1, 2018, DKGP Energy Terminals LLC notified AMID Merger LP of its termination of the membership interest purchase agreement. 
 ﻿
 Third Amendment to Credit Agreement 
 ﻿
 On October 12, 2018, we amended the revolving credit facility to allow the sale of the ethanol storage assets associated with up to six ethanol plants owned by our parent, with no more than 600 million gallons of production capacity. In addition, the lenders permitted the exchange of units as consideration for the transaction and also permitted modifications of various key operating agreements. Upon close of the sale of the assets associated with the Bluffton, Indiana, Lakota, Iowa, and Riga, Michigan ethanol plants, the revolving credit facility was decreased from $235.0 million to $200.0 million. There were no other significant changes in other covenants.    ﻿ Extension of Offer Period – JGP Energy Partners
 ﻿
 Effective October 15, 2018, we agreed with our parent to extend the offer period related to the potential purchase of the Green Plains interest in the JGP Energy Partners Beaumont, Texas terminal until June 30, 2019. The extension was reviewed and approved by the conflicts committee.
 ﻿
 Asset Purchase Agreement with Green Plains Inc.    ﻿
 On November 15, 2018, our parent closed on the sale of three of its ethanol plants located in Bluffton, Indiana, Lakota, Iowa, and Riga, Michigan to Valero. Correspondingly, the storage assets located adjacent to such plants were sold to our parent for $120.9 million. As consideration, we received from our parent 8.7 million Green Plains units and a portion of the general partner interest equating to 0.2 million equivalent limited partner units to maintain the general partner’s 2% interest. These units were retired upon receipt. In addition, we also received cash consideration of $2.7 million from Valero for the assignment of certain railcar operating leases.
 ﻿
 As part of this transaction, we amended the storage and throughput agreement with Green Plains Trade to reduce the quarterly minimum volume commitment from 296.6 mmg of product per calendar quarter to 235.7 mmg. In addition, we agreed with our parent to extend the storage and throughput agreement an additional three years to June 30, 2028. This transaction was reviewed and approved by the conflicts committee.
 ﻿
 Our Competition
 ﻿
 Our contractual relationship with Green Plains Trade and the integrated nature of our storage tanks with our parent’s production facilities minimizes potential competition for storage and distribution services provided under our commercial agreements from other third-party operators.
 ﻿
 We compete with independent fuel terminal operators and major fuel producers for terminal services based on terminal location, services provided, safety and cost. While there are numerous fuel producers and distributors that own terminal operations similar to ours, they often are not focused on providing services to third parties. Independent operators are often located near key distribution points with cost advantages that provide more efficient services and distribution capabilities into strategic markets with a variety of transportation options. Companies often rely on independent operators when their own storage facilities cannot manage their volumes or throughput adequately due to lack of expertise, market congestion, size constraints, optionality or the nature of the materials being stored.
 ﻿
 We believe we are well-positioned to compete effectively in a growing market due to our expertise managing third-party terminal services and logistics. We are a low-cost operator, focused on safety and efficiency, and capable of managing the needs of multiple constituencies across geographical markets. While the competitiveness of our services may be impacted by competition from new entrants, transportation constraints, industry production levels and related storage needs, we believe there are significant barriers to entry that partially mitigate these risks, including significant capital costs, execution risk, complex permitting requirements, development cycle, financial and working capital constraints, expertise and experience, and ability to effectively capture strategic assets or locations.

﻿
 Seasonality
 ﻿
 Our business is directly affected by the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels in the markets served by our assets. However, the effects of seasonality on our revenues are substantially mitigated through our fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, which include minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments.
 ﻿
 Major Customer
 ﻿
 We are highly dependent on Green Plains Trade and anticipate deriving a substantial portion of our revenues from them in the foreseeable future. Revenues from Green Plains Trade totaled approximately $94.3 million, or 93.6%, $100.8 million, or 94.2%, and $95.5 million, or 92.0% of our consolidated revenues, during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of Green Plains Trade and any development that materially and adversely affects its operations, financial condition or market reputation. For additional information, please refer to Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry and Risks Related to an Investment in Us.
 ﻿
 Regulatory Matters
 ﻿
 Government Ethanol Programs and Policies
 ﻿
 We are sensitive to government programs and policies that affect the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels, which in turn may impact the volume of ethanol and other fuels we handle. In the United States, the federal government mandates the use of renewable fuels under the RFS II. The EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total fuel sales. The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or the requirement severely harms the economy or environment.
 ﻿
 The RFS II has been a driving factor in the growth of ethanol usage in the United States. When the RFS II was established in October 2010, the required volume of “conventional” corn-based ethanol to be blended with gasoline was to increase each year until it reached 15.0 billion gallons in 2015, which left the EPA to address existing limitations in both supply (ethanol production) and demand (usage of ethanol blends in older vehicles). On November 30, 2018, the EPA announced the final 2019 renewable volume obligations for conventional ethanol, which met the 15.0-billion-gallon congressional target.
 ﻿
 According to the RFS II, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022. While conventional ethanol maintained 15 billion gallons, 2019 is the second consecutive year the total proposed RVOs are more than 20% below statutory volumes levels. Thus, the EPA Administrator has directed his staff to initiate the reset rulemaking process, and the EPA will modify statutory volumes through 2022 based on the same factors used to set the RVOs post-2022. These factors include environmental impact, domestic energy security, expected production, infrastructure impact, consumer costs, job creation, price of agricultural commodities, food prices, and rural economic development.
 ﻿
 Obligated parties use RINs to show compliance with the RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. Higher RIN prices encourage more blending of ethanol.
 ﻿
 Under the RFS II, a small refinery, that processes less than 75,000 barrels per day, can petition the EPA for a waiver of their requirement to submit RINs. The EPA, through consultation with the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture, can grant them a full or partial waiver, or deny it within 90 days of submittal. The EPA granted significantly more of these waivers for 2016 and 2017 than they had in the past, totaling 790 million gallons of waived requirements for 2016 and 1.46 billion gallons for 2017. This effectively reduced the RFS II mandated volumes for those compliance years by those amounts, and has lowered RIN values significantly over the past calendar year.
 ﻿
 Biofuels groups have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit, challenging the 2019 RVO rule over the EPA’s failure to address small refinery exemptions in the rulemaking. This is the first RFS rulemaking since the expanded use of the exemptions came to light, however the EPA has refused to cap the number of waivers it grants or how it accounts for the retroactive waivers in its percentage standard calculations. The EPA has a statutory mandate to ensure the volume requirements are met, which are achieved by setting the percentage standards for obligated parties. The current 

 
12

 
approach accomplishes the opposite. Even if all the obligated parties comply with their respective percentage obligations for 2019, the nation’s overall supply of renewable fuel will not meet the total volume requirements set by the EPA. This undermines Congressional intent of demand pressure creation and an increased consumption of renewable fuels. Biofuels groups argue the EPA must therefore adjust its percentage standard calculations to make up for past retroactive waivers and adjust the standards to account for any waivers it reasonably expects to grant in the future. 
 ﻿
 See further discussion in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 ﻿
 Environmental and Other Regulation
 ﻿
 Under the omnibus agreement, our parent is required to indemnify us from all known and certain unknown environmental liabilities associated with owning and operating our assets that existed on or before the closing of the IPO. In turn, we agree to indemnify our parent from future environmental liabilities associated with the activities of the partnership. Construction or maintenance of our terminal facilities and storage facilities may impact wetlands, which are regulated by the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under the Clean Water Act.
 ﻿
 Our parent’s ethanol production plants emit carbon dioxide as a by-product of the ethanol production process. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions. On February 3, 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the RFS II. Our parent believes that these final regulations grandfather its ethanol production plants at their current authorized capacity, though expansion of its ethanol production plants may need to meet a threshold of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement for the ethanol over current capacity to be eligible for the RFS II mandate.
