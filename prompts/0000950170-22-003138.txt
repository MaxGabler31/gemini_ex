ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
Laird Superfood is an emerging consumer products platform focused on manufacturing and marketing highly differentiated plant-based and functional foods. The core pillars of the Laird Superfood platform are currently Superfood Creamer coffee creamers, Hydrate hydration products and beverage enhancing supplements, harvest snacks and other food items, and roasted and instant coffees, teas and hot chocolate. Over time, Laird Superfood plans to grow revenues by further penetrating the multi-billion-dollar market opportunity presented by our current product lines, as well as expanding our platform to include additional products that meet our strict plant-based ingredient criteria.
As a result of growing consumer demand for Laird Superfood products and the continued expansion of our omnichannel distribution strategy, our net sales grew to $36.8 million in 2021 from $25.8 million in 2020. We operate in one operating segment and one reportable segment in light of our management reviewing financial information presented on an aggregate basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance.
COVID-19 Update
Beginning in March 2020 and over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, our senior leadership has met regularly to review and assess the evolving situation and to recommend risk mitigation actions for the health and safety of our employees. In order to enhance the safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented various measures, including employee screening protocols; facility cleaning and sanitation protocols; policies on the use of personal protective equipment; the installation of physical barriers between employees; and robust employee leave protocols. We have also implemented a work-from-home policy for certain office personnel.
 Market Opportunity
Laird Superfood participates in what the U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be a $800 billion grocery market as of 2021. Laird Superfood is specifically focused on the U.S. Natural, Organic and Functional Food and Beverages sub-segment of the food and beverage market. According to the New Hope Network, in 2020, U.S. Natural, Organic and Functional Food and Beverages and Supplement sales were approximately $259 billion and grew 13% from the prior year. Further, according to the Nutrition Business Journal, during the same period, third-party and direct e-commerce sales grew 60% for U.S. Natural, Organic, Functional Food and Beverage and Supplement sales.
Consumer preferences within the evolving food and beverage industry are shifting away from processed and sugar-laden food and beverage products, as well as those containing significant amounts of highly processed and artificial ingredients. There is also increasing recognition of the environmental impact of animal-based products. Per the Plant-Based Foods Association, U.S. retail sales of plant-based foods increased 27% from 2020 to 2021, reaching a market value of $7 billion, compared to increases of 15% in the overall food category.
Laird Superfood’s long-term goal is to build the first scale-level and widely recognized brand that authentically focuses on natural ingredients, nutritional density and functionality.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following strengths differentiate Laird Superfood and create long-term, sustainable competitive advantages.
An Emerging Platform Within the Rapidly Expanding Plant-Based Natural Foods Industry
Over the near and intermediate term, Laird Superfood is highly focused on maximizing revenue growth by further penetrating the multi-billion-dollar market opportunity presented by our current product lines. However, we believe the larger long-term opportunity lies in building Laird Superfood into a unique platform within the natural foods industry, which is currently dominated by single-product companies. The core tenets of this platform approach are strengthening our authentic and trusted brand name, growing our expansive omnichannel distribution strategy and the introduction of a constant flow of new products that align with our core ethos. This platform provides opportunities for continual expansion of our total addressable market (“TAM”) to allow long-duration growth, sustained differentiation of our brand, product diversification and leveraging our core strengths and operating costs to increase profit margins.
An Authentic and Trusted Brand Name
An authentic and trusted brand is one of the strongest long-term barriers to entry and sources of sustained differentiation in the consumer products industry. Since inception, Laird Superfood has invested heavily in building a trusted brand that consumers immediately identify as authentic, plant-based, nutrient-dense and functional. Along with more traditional methods of brand-building, we have effectively harnessed the authentic lifestyle of Laird Hamilton and Gabrielle Reece, both of whom have well-earned reputations for being on the cutting edge of fitness and nutrition. Our goal is to make Laird Superfood the choice for customers searching for nutrient dense, functional foods at a reasonable price. Our target market extends well beyond elite athletes into the mass market due to our recognition that Laird Superfood products must not only be natural, functional and nutrient-dense, they must also taste great and be affordable to provide access to all consumers.
Balanced and Highly Differentiated Omnichannel Distribution Strategy
Our highly differentiated omnichannel distribution strategy has three key components: online, wholesale and food service. In aggregate, this omnichannel strategy provides us with a diverse set of customers and wholesale partners, leading to a larger TAM opportunity than is normally available to products available primarily in grocery stores, along with an opportunity to develop a direct relationship with our customers at lairdsuperfood.com. We believe that, along with a trusted brand name, extensive proprietary distribution is a critical long-term and sustainable barrier to entry in the food industry.
Our Growth Strategy
Our primary growth strategies are as follows:
Open-Ended and Long Duration Growth Opportunity in the U.S. Grocery Market
The U.S. grocery market is one of the largest retail end-markets in the world. Laird Superfood’s strategy is to maximize penetration of this opportunity through a variety of avenues, including growing brand trust and recognition, significantly expanding our wholesale distribution footprint to multiples of our current level of approximately 8,100 retail doors and over 36,000 points of distribution, driving shelf velocity through an acceleration of online and offline advertising and introducing new products to expand our store footprint.
Exposure to Plant-Based, Functional and Natural Foods Portions of Grocery Market
Within the grocery category, there is an ongoing secular shift from highly processed legacy brands that demonstrate little nutritional benefit to natural, nutrient-dense, functional and plant-based alternatives. We expect the shift in consumer tastes driving the growth of natural and plant-based alternatives will continue throughout the foreseeable future as consumers become better educated on nutrition and focus on the health and wellness of themselves, their families and the environment. An increasing number of natural and plant-based products are moving beyond the natural and specialty stores and into conventional grocery stores. The continuation of these trends should benefit Laird Superfood as it seeks to penetrate the overall grocery market.
Business Model Characterized by Repeat and Recurring Revenues
Because the consumption of coffee, creamers, and hydration products is a daily ritual for many consumers, there is a natural and frequent repeat usage of Laird Superfood products among large portions of our customer base. For this reason, Laird Superfood has always enjoyed a meaningful base of recurring revenues due to repeat orders by its consumers and wholesale partners. Growing this base of recurring revenues is a strong focus of Laird Superfood as it evaluates new product development opportunities, acquisitions and marketing strategies.
Continued Expansion of Distribution Footprint
Currently, our products are marketed and sold through a diverse set of physical retail and online channels, including grocery chains, club stores, specialty and natural food outlets, coffee shops, juice bars, gyms, restaurants, hospitality venues, corporate workplaces, lairdsuperfood.com, pickybars.com, and Amazon.com. Maximizing potential distribution will be a key growth driver for Laird Superfood and our goal is to expand distribution so that our products are available wherever our customers choose to shop, whether it be a retail store, food service environment or directly online.
Maximize Market Penetration of Existing Product Lines
Laird Superfood’s existing creamer, hydration and beverage enhancing supplement, harvest snacks and other food items, and instant and roasted coffee categories represent a multi-billion-dollar TAM. We believe penetrating these core markets with our differentiated product lines provides Laird Superfood with a large and long-duration growth opportunity. In the near-term, Laird Superfood will focus on growing share within these categories.
New Product Development
While Laird Superfood’s current product lines are growing strongly and address multi-billion-dollar market opportunities with differentiated products, we intend to enhance our growth by launching new products over time. We are focused on creating products that conform to our uncompromising brand ethos of great taste, high-quality ingredients, nutritional density and functionality. Additional criteria for new product development include the potential for broad commercial acceptance, size of market opportunity, regulatory compliance issues, manufacturing process, availability and cost of raw materials, shelf-life and expected usage patterns by potential customers.
From a growth perspective, ongoing new product launches are expected to continually increase our TAM opportunity. Broadening our product line will also serve to diversify our revenue base and reduce exposure to potential competitive intensity in any one category. We expect all new products, whether developed internally or sourced externally, will ultimately be branded Laird Superfood and they will expand Laird Superfood’s opportunity to become part of our customer’s daily ritual of food and beverage consumption.
Opportunity for Tuck-In Acquisitions to Supplement Organic Growth and Expand Platform
On May 3, 2021, the Company acquired Picky Bars, LLC (“Picky Bars”), an innovator in the healthy snack industry focused on nutritionally balanced, real-food products. Prior to the acquisition of Picky Bars, Laird Superfood’s revenues have been driven solely by organic growth, and while we anticipate continued organic growth, we believe there will be opportunities to expand our TAM and diversify our revenue base through additional acquisitions. In this scenario, our belief is acquisitions would be of a tuck-in nature and target highly fragmented markets within plant-based foods. We would expect to target acquired products that fit within our ethos of great taste, high-quality ingredients, nutritional density and functionality.
Proven Efficiency in Marketing Spend to Drive Growth and Acquire New Customers
Throughout our history, Laird Superfood has maintained a disciplined, data-driven and returns-based focus on the deployment of marketing dollars to build our brand and acquire new customers. In our view, marketing dollars must be deployed efficiently to sustain growth over the long-term and eventually move Laird Superfood towards profitability. We have placed a strong focus on generating free and organic traffic for our website and social media channels, expanding our proprietary database of customers, growing subscriptions and acquiring customers from a wide variety of channels. These efforts are aimed at structurally reducing our dependence on the least proprietary and most competitive sources of online customer acquisition. Social media channels, in particular, are useful for launching new products and introducing promotions, as are the social media presences of Mr. Hamilton and Ms. Reece, and certain other influential persons who support the brand in their social media. We expect to remain disciplined in our customer acquisition efforts going forward and have plans to significantly expand the number of channels through which we will attempt to find additional sources of low-cost customer acquisition opportunities.
Vertically Integrated Business Model
Since inception, Laird Superfood has focused on building a vertically integrated business model. The core of this strategy is our highly efficient manufacturing process, which enables rapid expansion of production capacity, provides fixed-cost leverage on increased volumes and optimizes our ability to control quality. We produce our powdered creamers and hydration products on automated equipment. At this stage of revenue contribution, we have elected to co-pack our liquid creamers, harvest snacks, beverage enhancing supplements, and whole bean and ground coffee. Based on our current projections, we believe our existing footprint will support $100 million in annual gross sales of internally produced powdered products without a need for a material increase in capital expenditures. This provides us with substantial current excess manufacturing capacity to enable future growth in a capital efficient manner.
In addition to manufacturing capabilities, we have internalized branding, design, packaging, digital marketing, customer service and data analytic capabilities, along with finance, research and development, and human resource functions. Our broad in-house capabilities and extensive manufacturing capacity are expected to enable significant fixed-cost leverage going forward in manufacturing, as well as most other operating expense line items.
Targeting Top-Tier Food Industry Gross Margins
Strong gross margins will provide Laird Superfood with a sustainable competitive advantage, as these gross profit dollars can be used to invest in growth initiatives to further differentiate our brand, expand our revenue opportunity and increasingly cover fixed costs as we move toward profitability.
Focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Best Practices
Laird Superfood’s founders strongly believe we should seek to drive value for all relevant stakeholders, including customers, employees, community, shareholders and the broader environment. This philosophy of “Ohana” is particularly important to Laird Hamilton and Gabrielle Reece and permeates our culture. Laird Superfood is conscientious in its sourcing of raw materials, the carbon-benefits of facilitating plant-based alternatives, the impact of our operations on the environment and our community and providing products that discourage the culture of single-use plastics.
Our Products
Our authentic and sustainably differentiated plant-based products become part of our customer’s “Daily Ritual,” providing energy and hydration throughout the day, presenting the opportunity to expand a portfolio of plant-based products. As part of our focus on sustainability and a better-for-you “Daily Ritual,” the product categories we have focused on to date are coffee creamers, hydration and beverage enhancing supplements, harvest snacks and other food items, and coffee, tea and hot chocolate products.

Our gross sales by product category are reflected below:

 Coffee creamers include sales of powdered and liquid coffee creamers. Hydration and beverage enhancing supplements include sales of Hydrate coconut waters and our full Activate and Renew supplement lines. Harvest snacks and other food items include ready to eat food offerings as well as baking and pancake mixes. Coffee, tea, and hot chocolate products include traditional and functional ground and whole bean coffee, Hot Chocolate with Functional Mushrooms, and our InstaFuel line of just-add-water coffee and tea products. Other products include miscellaneous branded goods, such as coffee mugs, thermoses, t-shirts, and hats.
Coffee Creamers
Laird Superfood is part of the $5.6 billion domestic coffee creamer market with its cornerstone portfolio of Superfood Creamers. According to ReportLinker, the creamer category is expected to grow at a 5.6% compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") through 2026. Laird Superfood’s creamer business grew 18% in 2021.
In July 2015, we introduced the Original Laird Superfood Creamer and since that time have introduced several additional flavors. In April 2020, Laird Superfood entered the liquid creamer market, expanding its TAM to $5.6 billion.
Laird Superfood sells 13 SKUs of powdered coffee creamers and seven SKUs of liquid coffee creamer. Sales of coffee creamer represented 59% of our net sales in 2021 and 71% of our net sales in 2020. We expect to continue expanding our Superfood Creamer platform going forward with additional flavors, nutritional profiles, and formulations based on consumer preferences and demand. Such products demonstrate attractive repeat usage and customer lifetime value characteristics.
The three main benefits and points of differentiation to consumers from our Superfood Creamer products are their taste, limited ingredient set, and their inclusion of plant-based fats. All creamers include Aquamin, a natural source of calcium and trace amounts of 72 other minerals, and all liquid creamers are differentiated by functional mushroom extracts in their ingredient set. Powdered creamers have the further appeal of shelf stability and on-the-go convenience.
Powdered Coffee Creamers
Laird Superfood’s Superfood Creamer was originated in powdered form for convenience and sustainability. We have developed 13 powdered SKUs: Original Superfood Creamer, Unsweetened Superfood Creamer, Cacao Superfood Creamer, Turmeric Superfood Creamer, seasonal Pumpkin Spice Superfood Creamer, seasonal Chocolate Mint Superfood Creamer, Vanilla Superfood Creamer, Original Superfood Creamer with Functional Mushrooms, Original Aloha OatMac Superfood Creamer, Unsweetened Aloha OatMac Superfood Creamer, Turmeric Aloha OatMac Superfood Creamer, seasonal Pumpkin Spice Aloha OatMac Superfood Creamer, and Original Aloha OatMac Superfood Creamer with Functional Mushrooms. Our powdered coffee creamers have an 18-month shelf life.
Powdered coffee creamers have historically represented a smaller, lower-price-point segment of the coffee creamer market, but we believe our powdered Superfood Creamers are expanding that segment and competing for customers who historically have purchased liquid coffee creamers.
Liquid Coffee Creamers
Our liquid coffee creamers were developed internally based on naturally sourced, delicious and functional ingredients. Liquid creamers provide the added benefits of being on the perimeter refrigerated shelf space, as well as a lower price point per unit.
We have developed seven liquid SKUs: Original with Functional Mushrooms, Unsweetened with Functional Mushrooms, Vanilla with Functional Mushrooms, Turmeric with Functional Mushrooms, Cacao with Functional Mushroom, Cinnamon with Functional Mushrooms, and seasonal Pumpkin Spice with Functional Mushrooms.
Hydration and Beverage Enhancing Supplements
Laird Superfood’s hydration and beverage enhancing supplement portfolio includes our Hydrate coconut water products (four SKUs), our Activate Platform (three SKUs), our Performance Mushroom and Mushroom Botanical supplements (four SKUs), and our Renew Platform (three SKUs). These products represented 16% and 15% of our net sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The main benefits and points of differentiation to consumers from our Hydrate products are a limited number of ingredients; no artificial sugars, ingredients or colors that are prevalent in most competing sports drinks; and a lower cost per serving than traditional single-use packaged sports drinks and coconut waters. Hydrate is also environmentally friendly due to its powdered form, avoiding single use plastics. The main benefits of our beverage enhancing supplements are a plant-based, less processed and recognizable ingredients set.
Hydrate
We currently produce four SKUs of our powdered coconut water Hydrate platform: Original Hydrate, Pineapple Mango Hydrate, Matcha Hydrate, and Orange Guava Hydrate.
In our Hydrate products, we focus on price per serving, emphasizing value in our products compared to single-use products.
Beverage Enhancing Supplements
Our beverage enhancing supplement line is currently ten SKUs: Performance Mushrooms, Stress Less Functional Mushroom Botanical Blend, Wellness Functional Mushroom Botanical Blend, Energize Functional Mushroom Botanical Blend, Activate Daily Jumpstart, Activate Prebiotic Daily Greens, Activate Immune, Renew Rest and Recover, and Renew Plant-Based Original and Cacao Protein.
 Our Activate Prebiotic Daily Greens and Renew Plant-Based Protein were launched in December 2020, our Activate Immune and Renew Rest and Recover were launched in May 2021, and our Mushroom Botanicals were launched in September 2021. We are in the early stages of building out our supplements portfolio and will continue to expand the breadth of our Activate, Renew and Mushroom offerings over the course of the next several years.
Harvest Snacks and Other Food Items
 Pili Nuts and Harvest Dates
Laird Superfood began selling four SKUs of high-quality, naturally sourced, functional snack products including Pili Nuts and Harvest Dates in the fourth quarter of 2020. We have developed three Pili Nut SKUs, including Himalayan Salt Pili Nuts, Matcha Pili Nuts, and Cacao Pili Nuts, and one SKU of Original Harvest Dates.
Picky Bars, Performance Oatmeal, and Performance Granolas
Laird Superfood acquired Picky Bars in May 2021 and began selling them as part of a portfolio of better-for-you foods. The acquired real-food portfolio includes ten SKUs of Picky Bars, four SKUs of Performance Oatmeal, and five SKUs of Performance Granola.
 Coffee, Tea, and Hot Chocolate Products
InstaFuel and Hot Chocolate with Functional Mushrooms
Laird Superfood sells four SKUs of high-quality instant beverage products pre-mixed with its superfood creamer, in a just-add-hot-water line of InstaFuel products: Original InstaFuel (coffee with Original Superfood Creamer), Unsweetened InstaFuel (coffee with Unsweetened Superfood Creamer), Matcha InstaFuel (green tea and Original Superfood Creamer), and Chai InstaFuel (black tea and Original Superfood Creamer). Laird Superfood also sells one SKU of Hot Chocolate with functional mushrooms.
We currently self-manufacture all our InstaFuel and Hot Chocolate products to maximize long-term margin and control quality.
Whole Bean and Ground Coffee
Coffees offer an intuitive and complementary sale to individuals purchasing our creamers and we believe that our organic coffee blended with functional mushrooms is a point of differentiation in the coffee segment. We currently sell ten whole and ground roasts.
Our coffees are sourced from Peru, and are a hand-picked, high altitude, shade grown variety selected for their low acidity.
Our Customer Usage Patterns
All Laird Superfood products are focused on providing nutrient dense and functional alternatives in multi-billion-dollar market categories, such as coffee creamers, sports drinks, and healthy snacks. Laird Superfood products are also designed to become part of an individual’s daily ritual and repeated usage patterns.
The majority of our business is currently conducted online, and we expect that percentage will decrease over time due to our anticipated roll-out across physical retail channels. We have multiple years of cohort data on all customers that have ordered through our direct website. We view this data as indicative of expected customer usage patterns across all channels on the basis of historic trend analysis.
Subscriptions play an important role in driving retention rates for our direct online business at lairdsuperfood.com and pickybars.com and in 2021 and 2020 subscriptions made up 39% and 30% of our direct online net sales, respectively. In addition to subscriptions, our direct online business has a high percentage of repeat users. In 2021 and 2020, 77% and 66% of the direct online net sales came from either subscribers or repeat users. These dynamics create meaningful recurring revenues and the combination of repeat usage, order frequency and retention rates informs our views on strategic marketing spend and customer unit economics.
Distribution Channels
We generate revenue through three channels: online, wholesale, and food service. Our customers and distribution channels include our online business through our website, lairdsuperfood.com, pickybars.com, and Amazon.com, as well as our wholesale sales to distributors and retailers in channels such as specialty, conventional grocery, mass market retail and drug retail and food service customers.
Our net sales by distribution channel are reflected below:

 Online
Our online business consists of lairdsuperfood.com, pickybars.com, and Amazon.com.
Lairdsuperfood.com sells all of our SKUs with the exception of our refrigerated liquid Superfood Creamers. Lairdsuperfood.com allows for online-only sales of trial products, prior to the investment necessary to launch in wholesale. Pickybars.com sells all of our acquired Picky Bar SKUs, plus a rotating assortment of our historic Laird Superfood SKUs.
Content on our website allows Laird Superfood to educate consumers on the benefits of our products and ingredients, market and cross-sell new products. It also facilitates our subscription business which has shown consistent revenue growth since its inception in May 2017.
For sales through Amazon.com, we utilize both fulfilled by Amazon (“FBA”) and fulfilled by manufacturer processes. Related to FBA, we send products to Amazon, and Amazon fulfills orders placed through its online marketplace from its fulfillment centers. Amazon charges us fulfillment fees for this service and may charge storage fees for certain inventory. We sell a number of our SKUs on Amazon.com. Sales through Amazon.com accounted for 16% and 21% of our total net sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Our net sales from our online business are reflected below:
   
 | For the Years Ended December 31, | 
 | 2021 | | 2020 | 
Lairdsuperfood.com and Pickybars.com | $ | 16,777,515 | | $ | 8,964,625 
Amazon.com | | 5,910,221 | | | 5,537,081 
Total direct sales, net | $ | 22,687,736 | | $ | 14,501,706

 Wholesale
Our wholesale business addresses the $800 billion grocery industry, as well as many non-grocery retail channels. In 2021, wholesale made up 37% of our net sales, and in 2020, wholesale made up 42% of our net sales. Laird Superfood products are sold through a diverse set of retail channels, including conventional, natural and specialty grocery, club, outdoor and drug stores. We estimate our products are in over 8,100 retail door locations and over 36,000 points of distribution as of December 31, 2021.
Our wholesale net sales include sales into wholesale grocery distribution, such as United Natural Foods, Inc. and KeHE Distributors, distributing to clients such as Whole Foods, Erewhon, Sprouts, Kroger, and Safeway, as well as direct wholesale sales to retailers across diverse channels, such as Costco, HEB, HyVee, Natural Grocers, CVS, and REI.
In 2021 and 2020, the wholesale business represented $13.6 million and $10.8 million of net sales, or 37% and 42% of our net sales, respectively. Our largest wholesale customer in 2021 and 2020 was Costco which represented 13% and 23% of our total net sales, respectively. No other customer represented more than 10% of our total net sales in 2021 or 2020.
According to SPINS, as of December 31, 2021, we have achieved a brand All Commodity Volume ("ACV") of 58% in the natural enhanced retailer channel, up from 52% as of December 31, 2020. In the conventional grocery channel, we estimate we have achieved 14% of ACV as of December 31, 2021, up from 11% as of December 31, 2020.
Food Service
Our food service business addresses a broad set of customers including local and regional coffee shops, juice bars, corporate offices, hotels, restaurants, college campuses, professional sports teams and gyms. In 2021 and 2020, food service was 1% and 2% of our net sales, respectively.
Laird Superfood has worked with Bunn, one of the largest coffee capital equipment manufacturers in the United States, to create the Laird Superfood Crescendo®, a plant-based latte machine that is a convenient solution for a variety of office, gym, restaurant, and other food service environments.

In addition to our Crescendo® machines, our machines platform also includes our other hot beverage machines ("HBM"), offering a convenient solution for office, food service, and coffee shop environments. Our HBM business is currently a small part of our revenue, but we believe it has potential to become meaningful given strong usage dynamics. As of December 31, 2021, last twelve-month net sales to food service customers were 1% of net sales, and our machine platform represented less than 1% during the same period.
Competition
Fundamentally, we do not believe our competition is our peer better-for-you, less processed creamer companies. We view our competition as the legacy products which are refined-sugar laden, highly processed, and have undecipherable ingredient lists. We believe consumers want more transparency and understanding of what they are putting in their bodies, and are seeking less-processed alternatives. We are driving those trends through a trusted, authentic brand platform.
We compete in the following markets, based on how we categorize our core products:
Coffee Creamers
Our creamer products primarily compete within the $5.6 billion domestic creamer market that, according to ReportLinker, is expected to grow at a 5.6% CAGR through 2026, and includes products offered by Danone SA, TreeHouse Foods Inc., Nestle SA and Dean Foods Co, among others.
We believe our creamers are differentiated from competing products due to their superior taste profile, a limited ingredient set, and a differentiated energy profile due to the inclusion of plant-based fats. In addition to being coffee additives, our powdered creamers are used by consumers in a variety of different applications, such as smoothies and baked goods.
Hydration and Beverage Enhancing Supplements
Our Hydrate platform primarily competes against hydration enhancing sports drinks. The two dominant competitors in the $8.3 billion sports drink market are Gatorade, owned by PepsiCo, and PowerAde, owned by The Coca-Cola Company.
Hydrate also competes within the $4.3 billion coconut water market, which is highly fragmented relative to the sports drink market.
We believe that our Hydrate platform is differentiated from competing products due to a very limited ingredient set that contains none of the artificial sugars, ingredients or colors that are prevalent in most competing sports drinks. Due to its convenient powdered form, Hydrate also allows customers to adjust serving size based on individual taste preference, has a lower cost per serving than traditional sports drinks or coconut waters and is environmentally friendly due to its powdered form and elimination of single-use plastics.
Activate, Renew and Performance Mushroom Supplements
Our Activate Daily Jumpstart, Activate Prebiotic Daily Greens, Activate Immune, and Renew Rest and Recover lines compete in the $119.7 billion global vitamin and supplements market. Activate Daily Jumpstart and Activate Prebiotic Daily Greens compete largely as an alternative to single-serve cold-pressed juices which frequently focus on similar ingredients (lemon cayenne mixes, and superfood greens mixes), and certain other powdered beverages.
Our Renew Plant-Based Protein line competes in the ready to drink protein powder market which is highly fragmented. According to Grandview Research, the protein supplement industry was estimated to be $18.9 billion in 2020. Ready-to-drink and pre-formulated drinks were anticipated to demonstrate the fastest revenue growth in the segment. Renew Plant-Based Protein is differentiated amid this market with a short, understandable ingredient list.
Our Performance Mushroom and Mushroom Botanical supplements compete in the natural supplement market, which is highly fragmented with several peer companies.
Harvest Snacks and Other Food Items
Our Pili Nuts primarily compete in the $36.9 billion North American salty savory snack market, which is expected to grow at a 6.1% CAGR through 2028, per Grandview Research. Pili nuts are wild-harvested, sprouted in purified mountain water and slow dried to preserve their delicate flavor. Our award-winning, better-for-you alternative to competitor snack products is differentiated by flavor and nutrient-density.
Our Picky Bars primarily compete in the $8.4 billion snack bar market, which is expected to grow at 4.4% CAGR through 2023, per Market Reports World. Nutrition, Performance and Meal Replacement bars, which includes our Picky Bar products, make up 73% of the snack bar market.
Our Performance Granola and Performance Oatmeal compete in the $16.9 billion cereal market, which is expected to grow at a 4.2% CAGR through 2026, per Market Data Forecast. Top competitors are Bob’s Red Mill, Kellogg and General Mills.
 Our Homemade Baking Mixes line competes in the domestic baking and mixes market, which grew to $8.3 billion in sales in 2020. 2020 represented a year of unprecedented gains in this market following a surge in at-home baking during the COVID-19 pandemic, and, according to Mintel, a significant share of U.S. adults plan to continue baking more often than they were in previous years. This trend bodes well for our better-for you alternatives, which offer a vegan and gluten-free option.


InstaFuel and Hot Chocolate with Functional Mushrooms
InstaFuel instant beverage products and our Hot Chocolate with Functional Mushrooms compete with other just-add-hot-water lines of instant coffee products and hot chocolate. The annual revenue generated from the instant coffee market in the U.S. was estimated to be $14.5 billion according to Statista in 2021. The hot chocolate market was $3.5 billion in the U.S. in 2021 according to Statista. Because it is being made with coconut sugar rather than refined sugars and includes functional mushrooms, we believe our hot chocolate product to be highly differentiated from legacy hot chocolate brands.
Whole Bean and Ground Coffee
According to IBIS Industry Statistics, the U.S. retail coffee market is estimated to be $47.4 billion in 2022. We believe that our line of high quality Peruvian organic roasts, as well as our more differentiated functional coffee blends, incorporating functional mushroom extracts, superfoods, and botanical adaptogens, have natural synergies for many buyers of our creamer products, and convenience of combined ordering on our online platform.
Supply Chain
Laird Superfood sources its raw materials from a variety of suppliers located both inside and outside the United States. The Company purchases substantial portions of its roasted coffee products from one supplier, coconut milk powder from two suppliers, and coconut water powder from one supplier. There are multiple sources of roasted coffee products, coconut milk powder and coconut water powder available to the Company, and management believes that the Company could find suitable replacements for these suppliers on substantially similar terms. In addition, the Company sources all of its Aquamin from a single supplier. Raw materials are shipped to our production facility in Sisters, Oregon where they are stored in our warehouse and production facility. For products we self-manufacture, these raw materials are then mixed and packaged into finished goods. Finished goods are then warehoused and shipped out of Sisters to both retail and wholesale customers, as well as distributors across the country. A minority of our products are manufactured and packaged offsite. The finished goods are then typically shipped by our co-packers to our warehouse in Sisters where we then ship them to end-customers.
Laird Superfood has a supplier code of conduct for the ethical sourcing of raw materials from within and outside the United States, which it provides to suppliers as part of its supplier-onboarding process.
Regulation
We are subject to a wide range of governmental regulations and policies. We are required to comply with the regulations and policies promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), the United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), the United States Department of Labor ("DOL"), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), in addition to corresponding state and local agencies. In addition, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) monitors claims made by companies, particularly with celebrity spokespeople. Our importers, packers, distributors, and suppliers are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters.
 USDA National Organic Program and Similar Regulations
We are involved in the sourcing, manufacturing, supplying, processing, marketing, selling and distribution of organic food products and, as such, are subject to certain organic quality assurance standards. The Organic Foods Production Act mandates that the USDA develop national standards for organically produced agricultural products to assure consumers that those products marketed as organic meet consistent, uniform standards. We currently manufacture and distribute a number of organic products that are subject to the standards set forth in the Organic Foods Production Act and the regulations adopted thereunder by the USDA National Organic Program. Our organic products are certified organic by a USDA-accredited certifying agent, and we believe that we are in material compliance with the organic regulations applicable to our business.
Additionally, our organic products may be subject to various state regulations. Many states have adopted their own organic programs making the state agency responsible for enforcing USDA regulations for organic operations. However, state organic programs may also add more restrictive requirements due to specific environmental conditions or the necessity of production and handling practices in the state.
Food-Related Regulations
As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are also subject to a number of federal, state and local food-related regulations, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (the “FDCA”) and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the U.S. The FDA:
•regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current good manufacturing practices and regulations affecting food manufacturing; 
 •regulates ingredient safety; and 
 •prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels. 


Some of the key food safety and food labeling regulations in the U.S. are discussed in the following sections. We are subject to the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, which, among other things, mandates that the FDA adopt preventative controls to be implemented by food facilities in order to minimize or prevent hazards to food safety. We are subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products.
 Food Safety Regulations
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”) enables the FDA to better protect public health by strengthening the food safety system. The law provides the FDA with new enforcement authorities and tools designed to achieve higher rates of compliance with prevention- and risk-based food safety standards and to better respond to and contain problems when they do occur.
We believe that we are in material compliance with the current regulations promulgated to implement FSMA that are applicable to our business. We are continuing to develop internal compliance policies and practices for those rules that have future compliance dates in order to ensure compliance by the required deadlines.
The FDA’s Foreign Supplier Verification Program requires that the United States owner or consignee of imported food take steps to verify that the foreign supplier of imported food is manufacturing the food in accordance with FDA requirements, that the importer understand what hazards the foreign supplier is controlling and how those hazards are controlled, and that this oversight program is documented. The regulation is being implemented using a tiered series of compliance dates based on the size of the U.S. importer and the foreign supplier. We have developed a program that we believe is in compliance with this regulation and are monitoring its ongoing implementation.
We are subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, food safety systems, transportation of food products, record keeping, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products.
Food Labeling Regulations
The Company is subject to certain requirements relating to food labeling under the FDCA and corresponding FDA regulations as well as the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act enacted in 1967 and corresponding FTC regulations. Although the FTC and FDA share jurisdiction over claims made by manufacturers of food products (with the USDA also having jurisdiction over “organic” claims), the FDA retains primary jurisdiction over the labeling of food products whereas the FTC regulates advertising.
The FDA and FTC require that all food products be labeled to disclose the net contents, the identity of commodity, nutrition information, and the name and place of business of the product’s manufacturer, packer, or distributor. Both agencies also require that any claim on the product be truthful and not misleading. The FDA also has detailed regulations and requirements governing various types of claims about products’ nutritional value and wellness benefits, such as a nutrient content claims, health claims, and structure-function claims. Claims falling under these regulations must be phrased in specific ways to avoid misbranding the food. We believe we are in compliance with applicable FDA claims regulations.
Other state and local statutes and regulations may impose additional food labeling requirements. For instance, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (commonly known as Proposition 65) requires, with a few exceptions, that a specific warning appear on any consumer product sold in California that contains a substance, above certain levels, listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. This law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products.
Environmental Regulations
We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state and local environmental regulations. Some of the key environmental regulations in the U.S. include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Air quality regulations—air quality is regulated by the EPA and certain city/state air pollution control groups. We file emission reports annually. 
 •Waste treatment/disposal regulations—solid waste is either disposed of by a third-party or, in some cases, we have a permit to haul and apply the sludge to land. Agreements exist with local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified levels of Biological Oxygen Demand (“BOD”), Total Suspended Solids (“TSS”) and other constituents. This can require weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. 
 •Sewer regulations—we have agreements with the local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified limits of BOD and TSS. This requires weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. 
 •Hazardous chemicals regulations—we file various reports with local city/state emergency response agencies to identify potential hazardous chemicals being used in our facilities. 
 •Storm water—all our facilities are inspected annually and must comply with an approved storm water plan to protect water supplies. 


We believe that we are in material compliance with existing environmental regulations applicable to our business. We do not expect the cost of our continued compliance with existing environmental regulations to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, cash flows or competitive position in the foreseeable future.
 Consumer Protection Regulations
The FTC has the authority to regulate traditional and digital advertising for most types of consumer products, including our product offerings. The FTC has interpreted the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”) to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce and oversees express and implied claims in advertising as well as certain promotional activities such as the use of social media influencers by advertising companies.
Our marketing, advertising, and promotional activities for our consumer products must adhere to the FTC Act’s requirement for truthful, non-misleading and adequately substantiated claims. If our advertising does not comply with FTC and similar state requirements, we could become subject to an investigation by the FTC or a consent decree, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and reputation.
We believe that we are in material compliance with existing consumer protection regulations applicable to our business. We do not expect the cost of our continued compliance with existing consumer protection regulations to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, cash flows or competitive position in the foreseeable future.
 Employee Safety Regulations
We are subject to certain safety regulations, including OSHA regulations. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations applicable to our business.
As we work in a critical infrastructure industry as part of the nation’s food supply, we have implemented health and safety policies for all of our staff, including a transition to telework wherever reasonably possible; enacted strict sanitation protocols throughout our operations; and restricted access to visitors. Our top priority is the health and safety of our employees, and we are following published guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other governmental health organizations in implementing procedures to protect our employees.
Intellectual Property
We have the right to the following material trademarks: Laird Superfood, Superfood Creamer, InstaFuel, Picky Bars, and Picky Bars Drizzle in the United States, and Laird Superfood in several international jurisdictions, including the European Union.
Human Capital Resources
Laird Superfood is a company built upon a strong vision, mission, and values set, all of which guide how we leverage our human capital in a positive way. Our culture is demonstrated internally via our regular recognition of employees and externally via activities such as our youth skill building partnerships and volunteer trail clean-up for the Deschutes segment of the Oregon Timber Trail. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 145 full-time employees, four part-time employees, and three temporary employees. None of these employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are good. 
We have developed and are executing on a complete program to manage the full employee life cycle, which begins with talent acquisition, focuses on robust onboarding and effective communication, includes a dynamic performance management program, utilizes engagement best practices, and is rounded out by career development and succession planning across our organization. We continuously strive to cultivate and support a highly engaged and productive workforce.
Talent Acquisition
We have a strong track record of directly recruiting top talent but we also partner with external professional recruiting firms and headhunters to enhance our recruiting efforts when appropriate. We have relationships with local and targeted colleges and universities to supply key talent in areas like Food Science and Quality Assurance. We have also developed a partnership with our community high school to offer skills training and career experience to establish a pipeline of talent for our front-line workforce.
Onboarding and Communication
In order to create a high-performing team, we establish a firm foundation of business understanding through a robust and cross-functional onboarding process. Every employee begins with a common understanding of our history, vision, mission, values, and goals and objectives, and we train employees regarding fundamentals such as workplace and food safety and their employee rights and benefits.
We actively seek opportunities for effective communication. Major communication efforts include quarterly all-hands meeting and a semi-monthly internal newsletter, which communicate content such as a CEO message, departmental updates, business priorities, and team member information. Departments meet individually and cross-functionally in a variety of ways. Managers are trained to hold regular one-on-one meetings to communicate on projects, tasks, feedback, and development. Individuals are encouraged to communicate through both formal methods and our Open-Door Policy.
Engagement
Our engagement program is centered upon an annual engagement survey, which serves as an annual benchmark and leads into a series of in-person focus groups to further understand and act upon our employee feedback. The focus groups allow us to drill down on employee feedback, give voice to our workforce, and create an annual action plan for increasing our engagement and productivity.
Performance Management
We have built a robust performance management program that seeks to combine best practices and innovation. Our program begins with goal/objective setting at the company, department, and individual level. The program incorporates regular, direct feedback in one-to-one conversations between managers and direct reports across all levels of the organization. A major component of our performance management program is our Annual Performance Evaluation that includes 360 assessments, ensuring performance is measured and enhanced not only by the manager’s assessment but through peer feedback and feedback on management as well. Any time of the year, employees can ask for or offer feedback transparently and easily through a shared platform in support of our feedback-focused performance management culture.
Talent Development
We conduct an annual talent review to identify top performers and high potential talent. This review informs our development activities and skill-building opportunities of our employees across all levels. We have a strong track record of internal growth and development with many examples of employees growing into new roles with increasing responsibility. We offer employees the opportunity to participate in external leadership development programs in person or online, as well through professional associations and conferences. Additionally, we offer internal training on targeted competencies such as giving and receiving feedback and effective goal setting.
Succession Planning
We have a formal succession planning process that is designed to work in concert with our talent review and performance management processes. A systematic and regular review of our internal talent is critical to meeting the future needs of our business. Our process allows us to both identify immediate and long-range succession planning to ensure our business can continue operating at the highest level.
Compensation and Benefits
 Our total rewards program is designed to ensure our talented team is both fairly paid and rewarded for performance. We ensure market competitiveness and continually make smart adjustments where necessary with the goal of retaining top talent and ensuring equitable pay practices. We offer competitive benefits to ensure that our employees are provided for across the full range of employee rewards, including an equity grant program and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). We also offer employer paid medical and vision insurance, dental insurance, life and short-term disability insurance, a retirement savings plan.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe diversity and inclusion enable the company to benefit from multiple points of view and broad thinking innovation. Diversity and inclusion better positions us to understand our customers’ needs and to ultimately succeed in our vision of providing better food for a better world. We approach diversity from the top-down, exemplified by our Board of Directors (the "Board") and our Executive Leadership Team: two of our seven directors are racially/ethnically diverse, and three of six members of our Executive Leadership Team are women. Our workforce is similarly gender diverse with 53% male and 47% female. Additionally, since 2020 we have partnered with special needs organizations to provide job opportunities, career education, and skills training in our facilities. Our hiring efforts include emphasis on employment of special needs individuals. We continue to seek opportunities for building an inclusive culture that encourages, supports, and celebrates the diverse voices of our world.
