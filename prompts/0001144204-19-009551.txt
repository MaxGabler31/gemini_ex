Our Company
 
We manufacture a high-water content, electron beam cross-linked, aqueous polymer hydrogels, or gels, used for wound care, medical diagnostics, transdermal drug delivery and cosmetics. We believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers of high-performance gels in the United States. We specialize in custom gels by capitalizing on proprietary manufacturing technologies. We have historically served as a contract manufacturer, supplying our gels to third parties who incorporate them into their own products. Our contract manufacturing business provides custom hydrogels to the OEM market.
Adynxx Merger 
 
On October 11, 2018, we, Embark Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary (“Adynxx Merger Sub”), and Adynxx, Inc., a privately-held Delaware corporation (“Adynxx”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “ Adynxx Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Adynxx Merger Agreement, Adynxx Merger Sub will merge with and into Adynxx, with Adynxx becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of us and the surviving corporation of the merger (the “Adynxx Merger”).
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Adynxx Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Adynxx Merger (the “Effective Time”), (a) each outstanding share of Adynxx common stock, on an as-converted basis taking into consideration all outstanding common stock, preferred stock, restricted stock and all other securities convertible or exercisable for Adynxx common stock, will be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of our common stock (the “Common Stock”) equal to the exchange ratio described below; (b) each outstanding Adynxx stock option that has not previously been exercised prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by us; and (c) each outstanding warrant to acquire Adynxx capital stock that has not previously been exercised prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by us.
 
Under the exchange ratio formula in the Adynxx Merger Agreement, as of immediately after the Adynxx Merger, but excluding the effect of certain financings (as further described in the Adynxx Merger Agreement), the former Adynxx securityholders are expected to own approximately 86% of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding following the consummation of the Adynxx Merger (the “Post-Closing Shares”), and our stockholders as of immediately prior to the Merger are expected to own approximately 14% of the aggregate number of Post-Closing Shares. This exchange ratio will be fixed immediately prior to the Effective Time to reflect our and Adynxx’s equity capitalization as of immediately prior to such time. In addition, to the extent Adynxx consummates a Permitted Financing, as specifically defined in the Adynxx Merger Agreement, in excess of $10 million dollars prior to the Effective Time, the exchange ratio may be further adjusted in a manner that would reduce the percentage of the aggregate number of Post-Closing Shares held by our stockholders as of immediately prior to the Adynxx Merger.
 
Immediately following the Adynxx Merger, the name of the Company will be changed from “Alliqua BioMedical, Inc.” to “Adynxx, Inc.” At the Effective Time, the Adynxx Merger Agreement contemplates that the Board of Directors of the Company will consist of such directors selected by Adynxx; we will have the right to designate one member. Our executive officers immediately after the Effective Time will be designated by Adynxx.
 
The transactions contemplated by the Adynxx Merger Agreement must be approved by affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast affirmatively or negatively. In addition to the receipt of our approval of our stockholders, each party’s obligation to consummate the Adynxx Merger is conditioned upon certain other customary closing conditions.
 
Spin-Off and Merger of AquaMed
 
On November 27, 2018, AquaMed Technologies, Inc. (“AquaMed”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, AQ TOP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AquaMed (“TOP Merger Sub”), and TO Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“TOP”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “TOP Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the TOP Merger Agreement, TOP Merger Sub will merge with and into TOP, with TOP becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the AquaMed and the surviving company of the merger (the “TOP Merger”).

-

 

The TOP Merger is expected to occur after our consummation of the following steps:
 
(1) Pursuant to an Asset Contribution and Separation Agreement to be entered into by and between us and AquaMed (the “Separation Agreement”) prior to consummation of the TOP Merger, we will transfer certain assets and liabilities utilized primarily in connection with our custom hydrogels contract manufacturing business to AquaMed (the “Separation”),
 
(2) AquaMed will issue a to be determined number of shares of its common stock to us in consideration of the contribution of assets pursuant to the Separation Agreement (the “Distribution Consideration”),
 
(3) We will distribute to our stockholders all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of AquaMed by way of a pro rata dividend (the “Distribution” and together with the Separation, the “Spin-Off”), and
 
(4) We intend to consummate the previously announced reverse merger transaction with Adynxx, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of October 11, 2018, by and among Alliqua, Embark Merger Sub, Inc. and Adynxx.
 
At the effective time of the TOP Merger, all of the outstanding membership units of TOP will be converted into the right to receive, in the aggregate, merger consideration consisting of shares of AquaMed common stock. Immediately after the effective time of the TOP Merger and consummation of the Private Placement (as specifically defined in the TOP Merger Agreement), before giving effect to any fees payable in equity to financial advisors or other intermediaries, the current members of TOP and the third-party investors that participate in the Private Placement are expected to hold approximately 90% of the total number of shares of AquaMed common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis).
 
Completion of the Asset Sale Transaction with Celularity 
 
On May 7, 2018, we completed the sale of substantially all of our assets (the “AST”) to Celularity, Inc. (“Celularity”), including certain assets comprising our MIST, Biovance and Interfyl product lines (the “Purchased Assets”) pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement (the “APA”), dated January 5, 2018 with Celularity. As consideration for the Purchased Assets, Celularity paid a purchase price of $29.0 million in cash. No debt or significant liabilities were assumed by Celularity.
 
Under the terms of the APA, we retained certain specified assets, including, among other things, cash, accounts receivable and our hydrogel contract manufacturing business, including our SilverSeal and Hydress product lines.

In connection with the completion of the AST, we terminated our Credit Agreement and Guaranty (the “Credit Agreement”), dated as of May 29, 2015, as amended, by and among us, AquaMed (“Guarantor”), and Perceptive Credit Holdings LP (“Perceptive”). Additionally, we terminated the related Pledge and Security Agreement, dated as of May 29, 2015, by and among us, Guarantor and Perceptive. The Credit Agreement provided for a senior secured term loan in a single borrowing to us in the initial principal amount of approximately $15.5 million, of which approximately $12.0 million remained outstanding on the termination date. The full unpaid principal amount of the term loan and associated fees were paid off.
 
Products and Services
 
We maintain our legacy contract manufacturing business, which provides custom hydrogels to the OEM market.
 
Contract Manufacturing
 
In connection with our legacy contract manufacturing business; we develop, manufacture and market high water content, electron beam cross-linked, aqueous polymer hydrogels, or gels, used for wound care, medical diagnostics, transdermal drug delivery and cosmetics. We specialize in custom gels by capitalizing on proprietary manufacturing technologies. Our products are manufactured using proprietary and non-proprietary mixing, coating and cross-linking technologies. Together, these technologies enable us to produce gels that can satisfy rigid tolerance specifications with respect to a wide range of physical characteristics (e.g., thickness, water content, adherence, absorption, moisture vapor transmission rate (a measure of the passage of water vapor through a substance) and release rate) while maintaining product integrity. Additionally, we have the manufacturing ability to offer broad choices in the selection of liners onto which the gels are coated. Consequently, our customers are able to determine tolerances in moisture vapor transmission rate and active ingredient release rates while personalizing color and texture.
Planned Future Operations
 
We intend to continue to maximize stockholder interests with a goal of returning value to our stockholders. We intend to pay a special dividend to our stockholders and consummate the Spin-Off, the Adynxx Merger and the TOP Merger in the first half of 2019.
 
If we consummate the Spin-Off and TOP Merger, the assets and liabilities associated with our legacy contract manufacturing business will be contributed to AquaMed in connection with the Separation, all of the issued and outstanding shares of AquaMed common stock will be distributed to our stockholders in the Distribution and TOP will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of AquaMed in the TOP Merger. After the consummation of such transactions, AquaMed will be an independent company and we will no longer engage in our legacy contract manufacturing business.

Immediately after the Spin-Off we expect to consummate the Adynxx Merger with Adynxx whereby Adynxx will become our wholly-owned subsidiary. If we consummate the Spin-Off and Adynxx Merger, our business and operations will no longer include our legacy contract manufacturing business and will become the business and operations of Adynxx.
 
If we do not receive stockholder approval for the Adynxx Merger, the Adynxx Merger will not occur and Adynxx will not become our wholly-owned subsidiary. The consummation of the Adynxx Merger, however, is a condition to the closing of the Spin-Off. In the event that our stockholders do not approve the Adynxx Merger and the Adynxx Merger is not consummated, then we may, in our discretion, determine not to effect the Spin-Off, in which case, AquaMed will remain our wholly-owned subsidiary and we will retain our the assets and liabilities associated with our legacy contract manufacturing business.
 
Subject to the risks mentioned below, if the Adynxx Merger or the Spin-Off does not occur we will explore other strategic options or we may seek merger or licensing opportunities to bring additional assets into our product portfolio. 
 
Industry and Markets
 
The Hydrogel Industry. Hydrogels are currently being marketed in the U.S. and abroad for the following applications:
 

• | Drug Delivery. Delivering medication through hydrogel patches has important advantages over traditional methods of drug delivery. Hydrogel patches are less intrusive, painless, allow for pre-planned medication time periods, can potentially release medication in a manner consistent with the body’s own glandular activity (by avoiding dosage spikes and/or digestive alteration), and minimize side effects related to the medication via injection or ingestion.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Medical Applications. Hydrogel patches are being used for transdermal applications such as hormone replacement therapy and contraception, treatment of acne, shingles, diabetes, motion sickness, treatment of angina with nitroglycerin and treatment of smoking addiction using nicotine and palliatives (i.e., pain relievers).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-Prescription Therapeutic Applications. Hydrogel patches are also used in the medical community and are also directly marketed to consumers for topical application of over the counter (“OTC”) drugs such as non-prescription acne treatments, pain relievers, diet preparations, cough suppressants, treatment of warts, calluses and corns, and pain relief.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Moist Wound and Burn Dressings. Hydrogel dressings have long been used for treating wounds and burns. Clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of moist wound healing versus traditional dressings. Some of these benefits include immediate anti-inflammatory effects, allowing for freer cell flow and less scarring, increased absorption of exudate, and accelerated healing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Components of Medical Devices. Several medical devices utilize hydrogels as components. These devices include active drug delivery systems such as iontophoresis, warming and cooling devices, and medical electrodes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cosmetic Applications. Hydrogel patches and applications can deliver cosmetic skin care products to consumers and skin care providers for uses that include moisturizers, face masks, cooling masks and applicators.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
 
We continue to focus on sales and marketing efforts in the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any employees solely dedicated to sales, however, some of our employees perform in a sales capacity in addition to their other duties.
Customers
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, two customers accounted for 77% and 81% of our total net revenue from continuing operations, respectively. We are uncertain as to the larger customer’s intentions to use our services during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
Technology and Manufacturing
 
Hydrogels are manufactured by introducing a hydrophilic polymer into water to create a feed mix. The feed mix is then coated on to a liner and exposed to radiation. The polymers used, when exposed to radiation, cross link faster than they degrade, creating a matrix that gives the gels a solid form. Active ingredients such as prescription or OTC medication, skin care, wound healing or other materials can be added before or after cross-linking. Materials that do not survive the irradiation process (or are modified thereby) are added after the cross-linking process is completed. Once the products have been mixed and cross-linked they form sheets that can either be delivered directly to customers or first cut and shaped according to customer or our specifications, as appropriate. We believe that many of the processes described above are proprietary to us and provide us with competitive advantages.

Competition
 
We believe that our manufacturing capabilities, along with the high barrier to entry (the substantial cost of acquiring an electron beam as compared to other cross-linking devices and the cost and extended time required for installing this beam) and current minimal level of competition for high performance gels, affords us the opportunity to be a leader in the applications that require tight tolerances and/or incorporate active ingredients. We believe that awareness of our product, low cost, speed to market and manufacturing techniques, are advantages that will be conveyed to its customer base through a combination of consumer product entries, expansion within current original equipment manufacturer bases and institutional reach programs such as trade magazines, trade shows and through senior management contacts. To our knowledge, we are one of three manufacturers using electron beam technology for high performance hydrogels for the wound care, cosmetic and drug delivery industries.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Principal Suppliers
 
In general, raw materials essential to our businesses are readily available from multiple sources. For reasons of quality assurance, availability, or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. The principal suppliers for our raw materials are Dow Chemical Company (Chempoint), Berry Global, Inc., DeWolf Chemical, Inc. and BASF Corporation (Univar Inc). Our policy is to maintain sufficient inventory of components so that our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time.
 
Because we have no direct control over these suppliers, interruptions or delays in the products and services provided by these parties may be difficult to remedy in a timely fashion. In addition, if such suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver the necessary products or raw materials, we may be unable to redesign or adapt our technology to work without such raw materials or products or find alternative suppliers or manufacturers. In such events, we could experience interruptions, delays, increased costs or quality control problems, or be unable to sell the applicable products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue.
 
Other than as discussed above, we believe that, due to the size and scale of production of our suppliers, there should be adequate supply of raw materials from our manufacturers.
 
Patents, Proprietary Rights and Trademarks
 
We own or license trademarks covering our company and our products. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 
We currently hold patent rights to one patent in Europe, which covers the use of lignin for inhibiting restenosis and thrombosis formation and coated medical devices where the coating includes lignin. These patent rights are set to expire in September 2021. In addition, we hold an exclusive license with right to sub-license from Specialty Pharmaceutical Products, L.L.C. to two issued patents, one in the U.S. and one in Europe, which cover technology relating to a transdermal patch containing transcutol. The transdermal patch is effective to deliver lidocaine to a patient. These licensed patent rights are expected to expire in April 2032. We also rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 
Government Regulation
 
Product Regulation. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, medical devices are classified by the FDA into one of three classes — Class I, Class II or Class III — depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. While some applications of hydrogels fall under the jurisdiction of the FDA, hydrogels are generally classified as Class I exempt devices and the majority of the hydrogel products that we manufacture are thereby exempt from the FDA filing of any regulatory submissions and/or pre-market notification requirements. To the extent that any FDA regulatory submissions are required, we will be required to file these submissions and maintain all appropriate documentation. With respect to registering the manufacturing facility with the FDA under the Code of Federal Regulations, 21 CFR 820.1, Scope: Part A, it is stated that the regulation does not apply to manufacturers of component parts of finished devices. Currently, hydrogels are sold as component parts to various medical device/cosmetic manufacturers.
Quality Assurance Requirements. The FDA enforces regulations to ensure that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs, medical devices and/or HCT/Ps conform with current good manufacturing (CGMP) and/or CGTP. The CGMP regulations the FDA enforces are comprehensive and cover all aspects of manufacturing operations, from receipt of raw materials to finished product distribution, insofar as they bear upon whether drugs meet all the identity, strength, quality and purity characteristics required of them. The CGMP regulations for devices, called the Quality System Regulation, are also comprehensive and cover all aspects of device manufacture, from pre-production design validation to installation and servicing, insofar as they bear upon the safe and effective use of the device and whether the device otherwise meets the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. CGTPs are narrower in scope than CGMPs. CGTP requires a quality program to prevent, detect, and correct deficiencies that could increase communicable disease risk. To assure compliance requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas.
 
The FDA also conducts periodic inspections of drug, device and registered HCT/P facilities to assess their current CGMP/CGTP status. If the FDA were to find serious non-compliant manufacturing or processing practices during such an inspection, it could take regulatory actions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. With respect to domestic establishments, the FDA could initiate product seizures or in some instances require product recalls and seek to enjoin a product’s manufacture and distribution. In certain circumstances, violations could support civil penalties and criminal prosecutions. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a company is not in compliance with CGMP requirements, sanctions may be imposed that include preventing that company from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products and classifying that company as an “unacceptable supplier”, thereby disqualifying that company from selling products to federal agencies.

We conduct audits of our outside manufacturers and believe that we and our suppliers and outside manufacturers are currently in compliance with CGMP/CGTP requirements. We are currently registered as a device manufacturer and human tissue distributor with the FDA and we intend to register as a drug facility with the FDA when we are required to do so.
 
Environmental Regulation. We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations. We cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements in all material respects. However, we cannot assure you that current or future regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse effect on our performance, results or financial condition.
 
In the future, if a loss contingency related to environmental matters, employee safety, health or conditional asset retirement obligations is recognized, we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded. The investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time, and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, or cash flow, nor can we assure you that such liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on our performance, results or financial condition.
 
Federal and State Anti-kickback, Self-referral, False Claims and Similar Laws. Our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. Healthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex, and even minor, inadvertent violations can give rise to claims that the relevant law has been violated. Certain states have similar fraud and abuse laws, imposing substantial penalties for violations. Any government investigation or a finding of a violation of these laws would likely result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims in all material respects.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had six full-time employees. Of these employees, two are involved with finance, sales, marketing, and administration and four are involved with manufacturing, clinical and regulatory matters. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or other collective bargaining groups, and we consider relations with our employees to be good. We currently plan to retain and utilize the services of outside consultants for additional research, testing, regulatory, legal compliance and other services on an as needed basis.
