•Mobility & Materials: BASF, Celanese, EMS Chemie, Henkel, Lanxess, Mitsubishi, Royal DSM and Sika.
Against this competitive backdrop, value-in-use is the primary driver of price for the Company’s products, although price is impacted by many factors including, among others, fluctuations in supply and demand, and availability and cost of key manufacturing inputs including raw materials and energy. 
SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF MAJOR RAW MATERIALS
The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and its variants continue to adversely impact the broader global economy, including certain of the Company’s suppliers for key raw materials. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread supply chain challenges due to labor disruptions, increased raw material costs and component shortages, namely the semiconductor chip shortage. In addition, logistic challenges have increased significantly in the second half of 2021 causing delays and increased costs. The Company is actively working to mitigate the impact of the widespread supply chain and logistics issues.
DISTRIBUTION
Most products are marketed primarily through the Company's sales organization, although in some regions, more emphasis is placed on sales through distributors. The Company has a diverse worldwide network which markets and distributes the Company's brands to customers globally. This network consists of the Company's sales and marketing organization partnering with distributors, independent retailers, cooperatives and agents throughout the world.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The Company’s businesses differentially manage their respective intellectual property estates to support Company strategic priorities, which can include leveraging intellectual property within and across product lines. 
Trade Secrets: Trade secrets are an important part of the Company's intellectual property. Many of the processes used to make products are kept as trade secrets which, from time to time, may be licensed to third parties. DuPont vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets. When the Company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken, it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate. In addition, the Company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on loss to the Company and/or unjust enrichment.
Patents: The Company applies for and obtains patents in many countries, including the U.S., and has access to a large patent portfolio, both owned and licensed. DuPont’s rights under these patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company in the aggregate. The Company considers various intellectual property protections and strategic business priorities when deciding whether to apply for or maintain a patent.
The protection afforded by patents varies based on country, scope of individual patent coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country and type of patent protection. The term of these patents is approximately twenty years from the filing date in general, but varies depending on country and type of patent protection. DuPont's significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the Company’s strategic priorities within and across product lines. At December 31, 2021, the Company owned about 15,000 patents and patent applications globally. Approximately 75% of the Company’s patent estate has a remaining term of more than 5 years.
Trademarks: The Company owns or licenses many trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer retail level and/or the product line to product line level. Ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected.
ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG)
DuPont’s purpose is to empower the world with the essential innovations to thrive. The Company operates within four core values of protecting safety and health; respect for people; conduct in accordance with the highest ethical behavior; and protecting the planet. DuPont’s sustainability strategy is focused on driving innovations to create sustainable solutions that help address the most pressing challenges facing society and the planet; enhancing the sustainability of its operations and facilities; and protecting the health and well-being of its employees and communities. In 2019, DuPont announced its 2030 Sustainability Goals, including its Acting on Climate Goal - to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30 percent, measured from a base year of 2019, including sourcing 60 percent of electricity for operations from renewable energy and delivering carbon neutral operations by 2050. Additional information about DuPont's sustainability strategy and 2030 Goals can be found on its website as discussed below and in several areas of this report, including: (1) Environmental Proceedings beginning on page 27, (2) Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 30, (3) Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Information about DuPont’s ESG-related policies, programs, initiatives and goals is available under Sustainability in the About Us section of its website. The Company’s 2021 Sustainability Report, which is aligned to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core option and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") frameworks, includes information based on the businesses and facilities owned and operated by the Company during the calendar year 2020. As such, the 2021 Sustainability Report, and certain other information under Sustainability, does not reflect and has not been adjusted to reflect, among other things, the N&B Transaction, the Laird PM Acquisition, the Intended Rogers Acquisition or the In-Scope M&M Divestiture Process. 
The 2021 Sustainability Report includes discussion of the Company’s approach to ESG governance which is overseen by the Company’s Board of Directors. In 2021 the Company took actions to align its governance and enterprise risk management practices around climate-related risks with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 
Additional corporate governance information, including DuPont’s amended and restated charter, amended and restated bylaws, corporate governance guidelines, Board committee charters, and code of business conduct and ethics, is available under Corporate Governance in the "For Investors" section of the Company’s website.

HUMAN CAPITAL 
Foundational to the Company’s current and future success is its employees, who drive the Company’s strategic vision, manage operations and develop products. The Company focuses significant attention on attracting, motivating, and retaining talent at all levels. Through training and professional development initiatives, promoting a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion, and emphasizing the importance of health, safety, and well-being, the Company’s aim is to create an environment that fully supports the needs of its employees. Annually, an enterprise-wide engagement survey is conducted, which provides insight into employee morale and aspects of workplace culture like core values, communication and employee development. 
The Company is committed to creating innovative talent-management opportunities that are aligned to the strategic needs of its workforce. Learning is a continual process, and the Company offers a diverse set of training, education, and development opportunities, both formally and informally, throughout the year. Each segment within the Company has ongoing training 
programs that are designed specifically to maximize the performance of its employees in meeting business objectives, including better health and safety outcomes. All employees take part in a mix of on-the-job training and appropriate learning and training opportunities focusing on topics that are the most critical and relevant to each employees’ job function.
The Company believes that diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE&I") is central to high employee engagement and seeks to foster an environment where employees can bring their authentic selves to work each day. The more perspectives there are, the more ideas that can be generated, which makes DE&I a driver of innovation, and therefore, integral to the Company’s success. DuPont believes that it can only fulfill its purpose with the full commitment, participation, creativity, energy, and cooperative spirit of a diverse workforce, and is working to improve representation. The Company provides its Equal Employment Opportunity Employer Information Report (EEO-1) and other information on its DE&I efforts under Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in the About Us and Careers section of its website and under Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in the "Community Impact" section of its website. Nothing on the DuPont websites shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company is committed to ensuring equal opportunity for growth and fulfillment for its employees and to positively impacting communities in which it operates. The Company’s employee-led Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) help cultivate a culture of acceptance where employees feel not only accepted, but celebrated, at every level. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has eight corporate ERGs - DuPont Corporate Black Employees Network, DuPont Asian Group, DuPont Pride Network, DuPont Latin Network, DuPont Women’s Network, DuPont Veterans Network, DuPont Early Career Network, and DuPont Persons with Disabilities and Allies - all of which have regional and local chapters through the Company. Each group is actively sponsored by senior leadership, helping model and promote inclusive values and behaviors. The Company also offers DE&I tools and resources to educate managers and employees in how to utilize diversity as a resource and establish more inclusive work environments. These resources include networking and mentoring practices, and opportunities for participation in external conferences and events, among others.
DuPont's success also depends on the well-being of employees, including physical, mental and emotional health. The Company continuously strives for zero workplace injuries, occupational illnesses and incidents. The Company’s safety metrics are measured against this goal at least quarterly, and DuPont’s Environmental, Health, Safety & Sustainability Committee is charged with driving improvements in the Company's health and safety practices. All employees have the support of the Company’s Integrated Health Services (“IHS”) teams, which provides onsite and intranet-based services to support and monitor the health and welfare of employees. The Company’s larger manufacturing and research sites have onsite clinics where employees can get occupational care, first aid treatment, travel vaccinations, and referrals for off-site medical care. IHS also assesses health risks across DuPont to find out which health concerns are most important to the Company's employees, and conducts medical surveillance exams based on occupational risks and regulatory compliance priorities flagged by DuPont’s Environmental, Health and Safety team. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has corporate, regional and local crisis management teams in place actively monitoring, preparing and managing the Company’s response. The Company has implemented safety plans and protocols based on World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control guidelines. During the COVID-19 pandemic, employees have adapted to working in new ways, including remotely and on-site with social distancing, masks, and flexible scheduling. DuPont continues to embrace workplace flexibility wherever possible, recognizing that different jobs and teams have different requirements. In office environments DuPont supports hybrid working, allowing employees to mix on-site and remote working. In lab and production environments where remote working options are limited, DuPont continues to embrace flexible scheduling as feasible. These flexible working arrangements allow the Company to gain the best of what both remote and on site working have to offer while improving well-being, reducing travel, and benefiting the environment.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company employed approximately 28,000 people worldwide. Approximately 36 percent of employees were in Asia Pacific, 20 percent were in the EMEA, 2 percent were in Latin America, and 42 percent were in the U.S and Canada. Within the United States, about 6,000 employees were in non-exempt or hourly-rate positions.
