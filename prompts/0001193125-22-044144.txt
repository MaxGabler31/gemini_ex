  Fuel Specialties 
 Our Fuel Specialties segment develops, manufactures, blends, markets and supplies a range of specialty chemical products used as additives to a wide range of fuels. These fuel additive products help improve fuel efficiency, boost engine performance and reduce harmful emissions; and are used in the efficient operation of automotive, marine and aviation engines, power station generators, and heating oil. 
 The segment has grown organically through our development of new products to address what we believe are the key drivers in demand for fuel additives. These drivers include increased demand for fuel, focus on fuel economy, changing engine technology and legislative developments. We have also devoted substantial resources towards the development of new and improved products that may be used to improve combustion efficiency. 
 Our customers in this segment include national and multinational oil companies and fuel retailers. 
 Performance Chemicals 
 Our Performance Chemicals segment provides effective technology-based solutions for our customers’ processes or products focused in the personal care, home care, agrochemical and metal extraction markets. 
 This segment has grown through acquisitions, together with the development and marketing of innovative products. The focus for our Performance Chemicals segment is to develop high performance products from its technology base in a number of targeted markets. 
 Our customers in this segment include large multinational companies, manufacturers of personal care and household products and specialty chemical manufacturers operating in agrochemical, metal extraction and other industrial applications. 
 Oilfield Services 
 Our Oilfield Services segment develops and markets chemical solutions for fracturing, stimulation and completion operations, products for oil and gas production which aid flow assurance and maintain asset integrity and products to prevent loss of mud in drilling operations. 
 This segment had been growing strongly in recent years until the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted customer demand in 2020. We expect increased customer activity to return as the global demand for fuel increases. 
 Our customers in this segment include multinational public and independent companies currently operating principally in the Americas.

  Strategy 
 Our strategy is to develop new and improved products and technologies to continue to strengthen and increase our market positions within our Fuel Specialties, Performance Chemicals and Oilfield Services segments. We also actively continue to assess potential strategic acquisitions, partnerships and other opportunities that would enhance and expand our customer offering. We focus on opportunities that would extend our technology base, geographical coverage or product portfolio. We believe that focusing on the Fuel Specialties, Performance Chemicals and Oilfield Services segments, in which the Company has existing experience, expertise and knowledge, provides opportunities for positive returns on investment with reduced operating risk. We also continue to develop our geographical footprint, consistent with the development of global markets. 
Geographical Area Information 
 Financial information with respect to our domestic and foreign operations is contained in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Working Capital 
 The nature of our customers’ businesses generally requires us to hold appropriate amounts of inventory in order to respond quickly to customers’ needs. We therefore require corresponding amounts of working capital for normal operations. We do not believe that this is materially different to our competitors, with the exception of cetane number improvers, in which case we maintain high enough levels of inventory, as required, to retain our position as market leader in sales of these products. 
 The purchase of large amounts of certain raw materials across all our segments can create some variations in working capital requirements, but these are planned and managed by the business. 
 We do not believe that our terms of sale or purchase differ markedly from those of our competitors. 
 Raw Materials and Product Supply 
 We use a variety of raw materials and chemicals in our manufacturing and blending processes and believe that sources for these are adequate for our current operations. Our major purchases are oleochemicals and derivatives, cetane number improvers, ethylene, various solvents, amines, alcohols, olefin and polyacrylamides. These purchases account for a substantial portion of the Company’s variable manufacturing costs. These materials are, with the exception of ethylene for our operations in Germany, readily available from more than one source. Although ethylene is, in theory, available from several sources, it is not permissible to transport ethylene by road in Germany. As a result, we source ethylene for our German operations via a direct pipeline from a neighboring site, making it effectively a single source. Ethylene is used as a primary raw material for our German operations in products representing approximately 6% of Innospec’s sales.

  We use long-term contracts (generally with fixed or formula-based costs) and advance bulk purchases to help ensure availability and continuity of supply, and to manage the risk of cost increases. From time to time, for some raw materials, the risk of cost increases is managed with commodity swaps. 
 We continue to monitor the situation and adjust our procurement strategies as we deem appropriate. The Company forecasts its raw material requirements substantially in advance, and seeks to build long-term relationships and contractual positions with supply partners to safeguard its raw material positions. In addition, the Company operates an extensive risk management program which seeks to source key raw materials from multiple sources and to develop suitable contingency plans. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents and licenses, forms a significant part of the Company’s competitive advantage for all our segments. The Company does not, however, consider its business as a whole to be dependent on any one trademark, patent or license. 
 The Company has a portfolio of trademarks and patents, both granted and in the application stage, covering products and processes in several jurisdictions. The majority of these patents were developed by the Company and, subject to maintenance obligations including the payment of renewal fees, have at least 10 years life remaining. 
 The trademark “Innospec and the Innospec device” in Classes 1, 2 and 4 of the “International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks” are registered in all jurisdictions in which the Company has a significant market presence. The Company also has trademark registrations for certain product names in all jurisdictions in which it has a significant market presence. 
 We actively protect our inventions, new technologies, and product developments by filing patent applications and maintaining trade secrets. In addition, we vigorously participate in patent opposition proceedings around the world where necessary to secure a technology base free from infringement of intellectual property. 
 Competition 
 Certain markets in which the Company operates are subject to significant competition. The Company competes on the basis of a number of factors including, but not limited to, product quality and performance, specialized product lines, customer relationships and service, and regulatory expertize. 
 Fuel Specialties: Fuel Specialties is generally characterized by a small number of competitors, none of which hold a dominant position. We consider our competitive edge to be our proven technical development capacity, independence from major oil companies and strong long-term customer relationships. We believe we remain the world’s only producer of tetra ethyl lead (“TEL”) for use in aviation gasoline, which we market as our AvGas product line.

  Performance Chemicals: Within the Performance Chemicals segment we operate in the personal care, home care, agrochemical and metal extraction markets, which are highly fragmented, and the Company experiences substantial competition from a large number of multinational and specialty chemical suppliers in each geographical market. Our competitive position in these markets is based on us supplying a superior, diverse product portfolio which solves particular customer problems or enhances the performance of new or existing products. In a number of specialty chemicals markets, we also supply niche product lines, where we enjoy market-leading positions. 
 Oilfield Services: Our Oilfield Services segment is very fragmented and although there are a small number of very large competitors, there are also a large number of smaller players focused on specific technologies or regions. Our competitive strength is our proven technology, broad regional coverage and strong customer relationships. 
Research, Development, Testing and Technical Support 
 Research, product/application development and technical support (“R&D”) provide the basis for the growth of our Fuel Specialties, Performance Chemicals and Oilfield Services segments. Accordingly, the Company’s R&D activity has been, and will continue to be, focused on the development of new products and formulations. Our R&D department provides technical support for all of our reporting segments. Expenditures to support R&D services were $37.4 million, $30.9 million and $35.4 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 We believe that our proven technical capabilities provide us with a significant competitive advantage. Our Performance Chemicals business has launched significant new mild surfactants based on isethionate and taurate chemistry, which are well aligned with developing customer needs. In addition, the business has developed further formulations in emollients, silicones and surfactants for the personal care, homecare, agrochemical and metal extraction markets. Fuel Specialties has continued to innovate focused on bringing new technologies to market which reduce pollution and improve fuel economy, including detergents and cold flow improvers. In Oilfield Services, new technologies have been introduced to improve the hydrocarbon yield from customers’ operations and to protect assets, including friction modifiers, biocide formulations and additives to improve drilling muds. 
 Health, Safety and Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to environmental laws in the countries in which we operate and conduct business. Management believes that the Company is in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and has made the necessary provisions for the continued costs of compliance with environmental laws. 
 Our principal site giving rise to asset retirement obligations is our Ellesmere Port manufacturing site in the United Kingdom. There are also asset retirement obligations and environmental remediation liabilities on a much smaller scale in respect of other manufacturing sites. We regularly review the future expected costs of remediation and

  the current estimate is reflected in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The European Union (“E.U.”) legislation known as the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemical Substances Regulations (“REACH”) requires most of the substances in the Company’s products to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency. Under this legislation the Company has to demonstrate that the substances it uses in its products are safe for use and appropriate for their intended purposes in the E.U.. During this registration and continual evaluation process, the Company incurs expense to test and register substances it manufactures or imports in the E.U.. 
 Following the end of the Brexit transition process, on January 11, 2021 the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) government introduced U.K. REACH with the same registration requirements for substances produced in or imported into the U.K.. Furthermore, globally, similar regulatory regimes to the E.U. and U.K. REACH are also entering into force or are being proposed in several other countries. These registration based regulatory regimes will result in increasing test expenses and registration fees to ensure Innospec products remain compliant with the appropriate regulations and can continue to be sold in these markets. 
 Environmental, Social & Governance (“ESG”) and Corporate Social Responsibility Reporting 
 As part of our commitment to being open and transparent about our performance, our latest Responsible Business Report, which is our 2020 Report, was independently assured to assess its adherence to the globally recognized AA1000 Assurance Standard. 
 The Responsible Business Report, along with further information on our sustainability program and performance is available online in the “Corporate Social Responsibility” section of the Company’s website at https://innospecsustainability.com. Such information does not constitute part of, and is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Employees and Human Capital Management 
 The Company had approximately 1900 employees in 24 countries as at December 31, 2021. 
 Human capital management is critical to Innospec’s ongoing business success, which requires investing in our people. Our aim is to create a highly engaged and motivated workforce where employees are inspired by leadership, engaged in purpose-driven, meaningful work and have opportunities for growth and development. 
 An effective approach to human capital management requires that we invest in talent, development, culture and employee engagement. We aim to create an environment where our employees are encouraged to make positive contributions and fulfill their potential. 
 The Board is also actively involved in reviewing and approving executive compensation, selections and succession plans so that we have leadership in place with the requisite skills

  and experience to deliver results the right way. The CEO periodically provides the Board with an assessment of senior executives that have potential as successor for the CEO position, as well as perspectives on potential candidates for other senior management positions. 
 Core Values & Culture 
 Responsible Growth through Innovation and Customer Service: Financial stability and growth are essential to maintain our goal of making a positive contribution towards a more sustainable future. Generating economic benefits for our employees, stockholders, and local communities, while encouraging ongoing innovation in our product portfolio alongside excellent customer service which will allow our business to be competitive and sustainable. 
 Caring for People: We strive to create a safe and caring culture where our employees are supported and encouraged to make positive contributions. Our continued success depends on keeping people safe, promoting a healthy lifestyle, protecting human rights, improving education, training and maintaining good relations with our neighbors. 
 Conserving & Protecting the Environment: We aim to use resources as efficiently as practicable and minimize the impact of our operations on the environment. We look to supply safe, sustainable products, designed to meet the needs of society now and in the future while minimizing their environmental impact. 
 Leading by Example: We understand that honest, ethical and transparent conduct is vital to our success and reputation. Every employee plays an essential part in complying with local and national laws, rules and regulations. We uphold a high standard of corporate and business integrity across all of our activities. 
Employee Engagement 
 Attracting Talent: We believe our hardworking team of employees is our greatest asset. We employ approximately 1900 people across 24 countries and we believe that the skills, commitment and enthusiasm of our employees helps us to deliver long-term growth for investors. 
 Training: Across our sites, we provide local support and opportunities for the next generation of talent in our industry by offering a range of placements, internships, work experience and apprenticeships. We strive to attract and retain the best talent in a changing and competitive working environment. 
 As an organization, we are committed to making Innospec a great company to work for and we invest, as appropriate, in the development of our employees to meet this ambition. 
 Our employees are offered both internal and external training, where appropriate, to support their continued development and to meet the needs of our business. Where relevant, we support our employees’ ongoing professional training and development to encourage their progression within our business.

  Pay and benefits: We offer what we believe are competitive reward and recognition programs, based on both business-wide and individual performance. Our packages have been designed to attract and retain the best employees, reward achievement and encourage our teams to deliver superior performance for our customers and our company. 
 In addition to our company-wide performance incentive plans, we encourage our employees to share in the long-term success of our company with incentive programs, such as our Global Sharesave Plan. This plan gives employees the opportunity to participate in a savings plan linked to an option to buy shares in Innospec at a discount and, therefore, benefit from any growth in the share price over the savings period. We also provide a range of other benefits in line with the market practice in each location we operate in, including insurance and pension arrangements. 
 Performance Management Framework: We conduct an annual performance management process across the organization. Together with their line managers, employees agree upon annual objectives, and, at the end of the year, review with their line manager their performance against those objectives and their overall performance. The results of each annual performance review affect performance bonus amounts, pay reviews and career advancement decisions. 
 Senior Leadership Communications and Transparency: We actively seek opportunities for regular engagement and communication by our CEO and other senior executives with our broader employee population. Communications are through a variety of means including written communications, webcasts and conference calls. For example, we hold a CEO Call at least once a year, during which the CEO and CFO discuss current issues and developments in the business, including a Q&A session answering questions raised by employees. The CEO Call is accessible to all employees across the Company. In addition to the CEO Calls, each financial quarter, following the quarterly financial results announcement, the CEO and CFO provide a written review of the financial results to all employees. 
Diversity and Inclusion 
 Innospec aims to attract and retain the best people by ensuring that employment decisions are based on merit, performance, ability and contribution to the Company. As part of our Global HR Policy, our diversity and equal opportunities policy ensures that current and prospective employees receive equal opportunities irrespective of gender, sexual orientation, race, color, ethnic or national origin, marital status, age, disability, religion or belief. 
Health and Safety 
 Objectives: We prioritize the safety of employees, communities and everyone involved in the manufacture, use or disposal of our products. We set high standards for process and occupational safety, which is managed by our network of Safety, Health and Environment (“SHE”) professionals throughout the business. SHE is a top priority for Innospec with our three core objectives being that: 

• | No-one gets hurt
--+-----------------



9 

  
• | We don’t annoy our neighbors
--+-----------------------------


• | We leave only the gentlest footprints on our environment
--+---------------------------------------------------------


Leadership: The Company periodically reviews the Corporate SHE structure and organization so that we have the optimum resources and correct approach. We strive to embed SHE in our culture by having leadership that comes from executive management. Our Responsible Care Executive Committee (known as RESPECT) comprises members of the senior leadership team and is led by the CEO. RESPECT is responsible for setting the group’s SHE and Sustainability policies and objectives across the global business. It also monitors ongoing performance in these areas throughout the year. Through this structure, we have established a strong culture of safety within our organization. The RESPECT committee reports to the Board and conducts a major review of objectives and performance annually alongside quarterly interim reviews. 
 Training: Training is an essential part of our health and safety strategy. To minimize the risk of accident or injury, we give our employees the information they need, delivered effectively and at the appropriate time. Our ongoing training programs demonstrate our commitment to targeting zero accidents, making sure that safety is always front of mind and that we continually raise standards. 
 Every year, employees across our sites take part in a variety of site-specific training courses to enable them to be competent and safe in their roles.
