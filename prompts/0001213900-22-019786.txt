ITEM 1. BUSINESSBusiness Overview



General



Standard Metals Processing, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Standard Metals” or the “Company”) is an exploration stage company having offices in Gadsden, Alabama and, through its subsidiaries, a property in Tonopah, Nevada. Our business plan is to purchase equipment and build a facility on our Tonopah property to serve as a permitted custom processing toll milling facility (which includes an analytical lab, pyrometallurgical plant, and hydrometallurgical recovery plant).



The Company plans to perform permitted custom processing toll milling, which is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such as minerals in the gold, silver and platinum metal groups. Custom milling and refining can include many different processes that are designed specifically for each ore load and to maximize the extraction of precious metals from carbon or concentrates. These toll-processing services also distill, dry, mix, or mill chemicals and bulk materials on a contractual basis and provide a chemical production outsourcing option for industrial companies, which lack the expertise, capacity, or regulatory permits for in-house production.



We are required to obtain several permits before we can begin construction of a small-scale mineral processing facility to conduct permitted processing toll milling activities and construction of the required additional buildings for us to commence operations.



Any reference herein to “Standard Metals,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” is intended to mean Standard Metals Processing, Inc. a Nevada corporation, and all of our subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated.



Corporate History



The Company was incorporated in the State of Colorado on July 10, 1985 as Princeton Acquisitions, Inc. On December 7, 2009, the Company changed its name to Standard Gold, Inc. Effective March 5, 2013 the Company moved its domicile from Colorado to Nevada and changed its name from Standard Gold, Inc. to Standard Gold Holdings, Inc. Effective December 6, 2013, the Company changed its name to Standard Metals Processing, Inc. to more accurately reflect the business of the Company.

On March 15, 2011, we closed a series of transactions, whereby we acquired certain assets of Shea Mining & Milling, LLC (“Shea Mining”), which assets include land, buildings, a dormant milling facility, abandoned milling equipment, water permits, mine tailings, mine dumps and the assignment of a note payable, a lease and a contract agreement with permits. We completed the Shea Exchange Agreement to acquire the Shea assets to develop a permitted custom processing toll milling of precious minerals business in Tonopah, Nevada. Toll milling is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such as gold, silver, and platinum group metals. Custom milling and refining can include many different processes to extract precious metals from carbon or concentrates. These toll-processing services also distil, dry, mix, or mill chemicals and bulk materials on a contractual basis and provide a chemical production outsourcing option for industrial companies which lack the expertise, capacity, or regulatory permits for in-house production. The land encompasses 1,183 deeded acres, one of the largest private land holdings in Esmeralda County, Nevada. Approximately 334 acres of this land has an estimated 2.2 million tons of tailings known as the Millers Tailings from the historic gold rush of Goldfield and Tonopah, Nevada sitting on it.



Subsidiaries



The Company has one wholly owned subsidiary, Aurielle Enterprises, Inc. f/k/a/ Tonopah Milling and Metals Group, Inc. (“AE”), a Nevada corporation. AE has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Tonopah Resources, Inc., a Nevada corporation and Tonopah Custom Processing, Inc., a Nevada corporation.
Products and Services



We seek to establish ourselves as a custom processing and permitted toll milling service provider. Our business plan is to build a facility on our Tonopah property, which includes an analytical lab, pyrometallurgical, and hydrometallurgical recovery plant.



The Company’s intention is to become a full service permitted custom toll milling and processing company that facilitates the extraction of precious and strategic minerals from mined material. The Company will need to obtain permits for the planned construction and operation of our permitted custom processing toll milling facility with state-of-the-art equipment capable of processing gold, silver and platinum metal groups. Many junior miners do not have the capital or the ability to permit a processing facility, yet they have a large supply of mined material that requires milling be performed. It is often cost prohibitive or impractical for these mine operators to send their materials to processing mills owned by the large mining companies, or to other customers badly needing milling and processing services.



While Nevada has a historic role as a mining center with good proximate geology and ample mined product, very little custom processing toll milling capacity remains in the state. During the last several decades, other processing facilities have been shuttered due to high costs of regulations and the vertical integration of milling within large mining companies leaving junior miners with few options for local milling services. As a result, we are in a unique position among processing facilities because we are capable of true permitted custom processing. We have the only ball mill located within a custom toll milling facility within 300 miles allowing us to serve miners in the western United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America.



Many junior miners are undercapitalized, have limited access to capital markets and have a large supply of mined material that requires milling be performed. Many large mining companies reserve their milling capacity for their inventory, which does not make providing third party services worthwhile. This provides the Company with an opportunity to provide these potential customers with badly needed milling and processing services. Some of our mining customers will be able to take their tailings (the material left over after the desired minerals have been extracted) from the material they deposited with the Company and put it back in the exact same mines those particular tailings came from. This eliminates the need for the Company to dispose of those tailings.



Water Pollution Control Permit with Nevada Department of Environmental Protection



Through Tonopah Custom Processing, Inc. (“TCP”), a Water Pollution Control Permit (“WPCP”) Application was filed with the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (“NDEP”) Bureau of Mines and Mining Reclamation (“BMMR”) for the approval of the permits necessary for a small-scale mineral processing facility planned for the Tonopah property. The plant will perform laboratory testing, pilot testing, and custom processing of precious metal ores and concentrates from mining industry clients. Processing of ore materials will employ standard mineral processing techniques including gravity concentration, froth flotation and chemical leaching and carbon stripping.

The WPCP must be approved prior to commencing the planned construction of our processing plant in Tonopah, Nevada. While the Company awaits approval, we are preparing for construction of our processing facility which includes working with contractors that will be building the planned 21,875 square foot processing plant, cleaning and preparing the property, and refurbishing a trailer that will act as our construction office.



In connection with our WPCP application, NDEP suggested that we take the following actions: (i) retain a Nevada Certified Environmental Manager (“CEM”), (ii) perform Meteoric Profile II water testing on ground water directly below the mill as well as surrounding wells located off site, and (iii) determine baseline values of water using the Meteoric Profile II results. NDEP regulations require that the Company delay any new construction planned for “metal extraction” until after the permits are in place.



Survey



Advanced Surveying & Professional Services, a Professional Land Surveyor (“PLS”), completed surveys and testing of the Tonopah property required for the application of our required permits. After completion of the survey, it was determined the property is 1,183 acres. The scope of work the PLS completed includes: (i) setting a total of 19 permanent monuments at angle points along lines, (ii) setting eight permanent monuments locating US Hwy 95, (iii) recording a professional map indicating longitude and latitude for all corners, and (iv) providing a digital map accessible in Auto Cad software.
Site Preparation



We have completed the initial grading of specific designated areas on the 40 undisturbed acres of land including clearing all vegetation, removing of all scrap metal, and the excavation of the building pad for the preparation of the new 21,875 square foot processing plant and have completed the removal of all the extra and unnecessary materials and old equipment that has accumulated on the land.
Toll Milling



Toll milling is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such as minerals in the gold, silver and platinum metal groups. Custom milling and refining that are designed specifically for each ore load can include many different processes to maximize the extraction of precious metals from ore, carbon or concentrates. 
Procedure



Ore is sent to our facility at the responsibility and cost of the customer. The Company will take a sample of the ore through a specific ore sampling procedure. The Company’s metallurgist will test the sample on site. To obtain a quantitative determination of the amount of a given substance in a particular sample, the Company can perform wet methods and dry methods. In the wet method, the sample is dissolved in a reagent, like acid, until the purified metal is separated out. In the dry method, the sample is mixed with a flux (a substance such as borax or silica that helps lower the melting temperature) and then heated so that the impurities in the metal fuse with the flux, leaving the purified metal as residue.



If it is determined that the sample is approved for processing, the customer and the Company will then agree upon a value of the metal grade per ton. If there is any disagreement on the value, a third-party referee determines the value by testing the sample. The Company charges either a flat fee per ton of the ore processed or a percentage of the precious metals extracted during processing, or a combination of both based on the amount of work that is performed.



There are various methods of extraction. The Company determines which method to use based upon the sample sent to the Company. In most situations, a series of tests will be performed on a bulk sample ranging in size from 250 to 1,000 pounds. A metallurgist will determine the best process or processes to use for the extraction based on several factors. These include the composition of the host rock, mineralization of the host rock, whether or not it is an oxide or sulfide ore body, and the particle size of the precious metal. After the metallurgist reviews these characteristics, the Company will run ore on a gold table and assays the concentrates, middlings, and tails. An assay is an investigative procedure for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence or amount of precious metals in ore. If there is too much gold in the middling or tails, the size of the grind is adjusted to increase yield or if there is not enough gold in the middlings or tails the Company grinds the material to a finer mesh.

Some of our miner customers will be able to take their tailings (the material left over after the desired minerals have been extracted) from the material they deposited with the Company and put it back in the exact same mines those particular tailings came from. This eliminates the need for the Company to dispose of those tailings.



Concentrate/Leach Circuit



Concentration is the separation of precious minerals from other materials by utilizing different properties of the minerals to be separated including density, magnetic or electric and physiochemical. The Company will attempt to create a “concentrate” of minerals to reduce the size of each ton processed. The Company may also receive concentrates from customers, especially those where transport of tons of raw ore is not feasible.



The leaching process uses chemicals to extract the metals from the solid materials (concentrates) and bring them into a solution. Once the metals are in the solution, it is passed through carbon or resin columns where the precious metals are deposited onto the carbon/resin.



The metals will then be stripped from the carbon back into a different solution where they are pumped through an electrowinning circuit in a process called carbon stripping. The metals are then deposited onto stainless steel in the electrowinning circuit. After this stage, the metals are either sold or further refined off-site. The solution is recycled and used again to process additional material.



Recent Actions



On January 10, 2022 the Company executed a definitive agreement to acquire a controlling interest in Sustainable Metal Solutions LLC (“SMS”). The purchase price for the controlling interest in SMS will be determined based upon the price of SMPR common stock on the date of Closing, such date to be decided by the Parties in good faith after all conditions precedent are met. SMS is an American multi-company environmental development platform focused on producing carbon neutral precious metals and minerals thereby driving American mineral independence while revitalizing the environment and minimizing the impacts of climate change. The business of SMS is consistent with the Company’s posture to acquire, license or joint venture with other parties involved in toll milling, processing, or mining related activities, which may include Granite Peak Resources, LLC and its affiliated entities, including, but not limited to, NovaMetallix. Inc., and BlackBear Natural Resources, LTD.
