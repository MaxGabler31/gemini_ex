 Item 1 — Business
 History, Organization and Products
 Ferro Corporation was incorporated in Ohio in 1919 as an enameling company and today is a leading producer of specialty materials that are sold to a broad range of manufacturers who, in turn, make products for many end-use markets.  When we use the terms “Ferro,” “we,” “us” or “the Company,” we are referring to Ferro Corporation and its subsidiaries unless indicated otherwise. 
 Ferro’s products fall into two general categories: functional coatings, which perform specific functions in the manufacturing processes and end products of our customers; and color solutions, which provide aesthetic and performance characteristics to our customers’ products. Our products are manufactured in approximately 52 facilities around the world.  They include frits, porcelain and other glass enamels, glazes, stains, decorating colors, pigments, inks, polishing materials, dielectrics, electronic glasses, and other specialty coatings.
 Ferro develops and delivers innovative products to our customers based on our strengths in the following technologies:

· | Particle Engineering — Our ability to design and produce very small particles made of a broad variety of materials, with precisely controlled characteristics of shape, size and particle distribution. We understand how to disperse these particles within liquid, paste and gel formulations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Color and Glass Science — Our understanding of the chemistry required to develop and produce pigments that provide color characteristics ideally suited to customers’ applications. We have a demonstrated ability to manufacture glass-based and certain other coatings with properties that precisely meet customers’ needs in a broad variety of applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Surface Chemistry and Surface Application Technology — Our understanding of chemicals and materials used to develop products and processes that involve the interface between layers and the surface properties of materials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Formulation — Our ability to develop and manufacture combinations of materials that deliver specific performance characteristics designed to work within customers’ particular products and manufacturing processes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We differentiate ourselves in our industry by innovation and new products and services and the consistent high quality of our products, combined with delivery of localized technical service and customized application technology support. Our value-added technology services assist customers in their material specification and evaluation, product design, and manufacturing process characterization in order to help them optimize the application of our products.
 Ferro’s operations are divided into the four business units, which comprise three reportable segments, listed below:

﻿ 
-------------------------------------
 Tile Coating Systems(1) 
 Porcelain Enamel(1) 
 Performance Colors and Glass 
 Color Solutions 

  _____________________

(1) | Tile Coating Systems and Porcelain Enamel are combined into one reportable segment, Performance Coatings, for financial reporting purposes.

Markets and Customers
 Ferro’s products are used in a variety of product applications, within the following markets:
 ﻿

﻿ | 
---------------------------------+-------------------------------
 Appliances |  Household furnishings 
 Automotive |  Industrial products 
 Building and renovation |  Packaging 
 Electronics |  Sanitary 

  Many of our products are used as functional or aesthetic coatings for a variety of different substrates on our customers’ products, such as metals, ceramics, glass, plastic, wood and concrete. Other products are used to manufacture electronic components and other products. Still other products are added during our customers’ manufacturing processes to provide desired properties to their end product. Often, Ferro materials are a small portion of the total cost of our customers’ products, but they can be critical to the functionality or appearance of those products.
 Our customers include manufacturers of ceramic tile, major appliances, construction materials, automobile parts, automobiles, architectural and container glass, and electronic components and devices. Many of our customers, including makers of major appliances and automobile parts, purchase materials from more than one of our business units. Our customer base is well diversified both geographically and by end market.
 We generally sell our products directly to our customers. However, a portion of our business uses indirect sales channels, such as agents and distributors, to deliver products to market. In 2018, no single customer or related group of customers represented more than 10% of net sales. In addition, none of our reportable segments is dependent on any single customer or related group of customers.
 Backlog of Orders and Seasonality
 Generally, there is no significant lead time between customer orders and delivery in any of our business segments. As a result, we do not consider that the dollar amount of backlogged orders believed to be firm is material information for an understanding of our business. Although not seasonal, in certain of our technology-driven markets, our customers’ business is often characterized by product campaigns with specific life cycles, which can result in uneven demand as product ramp-up periods are followed by down-cycle periods. As our innovation activity increases in line with our value creation strategy, we expect this type of business to also increase. This type of market operates on a different cycle from the majority of our business. We also do not regard any material part of our business to be seasonal. However, customer demand has historically been higher in the second quarter when building and renovation markets are particularly active, and the second quarter is also normally the strongest for sales and operating profit.
 Competition
 In most of our markets, we have a substantial number of competitors, none of which is dominant. Due to the diverse nature of our product lines, no single competitor directly matches all of our product offerings. Our competition varies by product and by region, and is based primarily on product quality, performance and functionality, as well as on pricing, customer service, technical support, and the ability to develop custom products to meet specific customer applications.
 We are a worldwide leader in the production of specialty coatings and enamels for glass enamels, porcelain enamel, and ceramic tile coatings. There is strong competition in our markets, ranging from large multinational corporations to local producers. While many of our customers purchase customized products and formulations from us, our customers could generally buy from other sources, if necessary.

  ﻿

(1) | Primarily used by the Performance Colors and Glass and the Color Solutions segments.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Primarily used by the Performance Coatings segment.
----+----------------------------------------------------

  These raw materials make up a large portion of our product costs in certain of our product lines, and fluctuations in the cost of raw materials can have a significant impact on the financial performance of the related businesses. We attempt to pass through to our customers raw material cost increases.
 We have a broad supplier base and, in many instances, multiple sources of essential raw materials are available worldwide if problems arise with a particular supplier. We maintain many comprehensive supplier agreements for strategic and critical raw materials. We did not encounter raw material shortages in 2018 that significantly affected our manufacturing operations, but we are subject to volatile raw material costs that can affect our results of operations.
 Environmental Matters
 We handle, process, use and store hazardous materials as part of the production of some of our products. As a result, we operate production facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, particularly for wastes, wastewater discharges and air emissions. In addition, some of our products are subject to restrictions under laws or regulations such as California’s Proposition 65, the Toxic Substances and Control Act and the European Union’s (“EU”) chemical substances directive. The costs to comply with the complex environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations are significant and will continue for the industry and us for the foreseeable future. These routine costs are expensed as they are incurred. While these costs may increase in the future, they are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations.

We also believe that, to the extent that we may not be in compliance with such regulations, such non-compliance will not have a materially adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
 Our policy is to operate our plants and facilities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees and the public. We intend to continue to make expenditures for environmental and health and safety protection and improvements in a timely manner consistent with available technology. Although we cannot precisely predict future environmental, health and safety spending, we do not expect the costs to have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Capital expenditures for environmental, health and safety protection were $6.1 million in 2018, $6.2 million in 2017, and $1.4 million in 2016. We also accrue for environmental remediation costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount. We determine the timing and amount of any liability based upon assumptions regarding future events, and inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions or circumstances, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and evolving technologies. We adjust these liabilities periodically as remediation-related efforts progress, the nature and extent of contamination becomes more certain, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available.
 Research and Development
 We are involved worldwide in research and development activities relating to new and existing products, services and technologies required by our customers’ continually changing markets. Our research and development resources are organized into centers of excellence that support our regional and worldwide major business units. These centers are augmented by local laboratories that provide technical service and support to meet customer and market needs in various geographic areas.    Total expenditures for product and application technology, including research and development, customer technical support and other related activities, were $40.2 million in 2018, $36.4 million in 2017, and $27.3 million in 2016.  Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 We own a substantial number of patents and patent applications relating to our various products and their uses. While these patents are of importance to us and we exercise diligence to ensure that they are valid, we do not believe that the invalidity or expiration of any single patent or group of patents would have a material adverse effect on our businesses. Our patents will expire at various dates through the year 2037. We also use a number of trademarks that are important to our businesses as a whole or to particular segments of our business. We believe that these trademarks are adequately protected. Employees
 At December 31, 2018, we employed 6,059 full-time employees, including 5,292 employees in our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and 767 in the United States (“U.S.”). Total employment increased by 391 in our foreign subsidiaries and decreased by 14 in the U.S. from the prior year end due to the additions related to acquisitions and new business opportunities, net of cost reduction initiatives.
 Collective bargaining agreements cover 11.6% of our U.S. workforce. Approximately 2.2% of all U.S. employees are affected by a labor agreement that expires in 2019, and we expect to complete the renewal of the agreement with no significant disruption to the related business. We consider our relations with our employees, including those covered by collective bargaining agreements, to be good.    Our employees in Europe have protections afforded them by local laws and regulations through unions and works councils. Some of these laws and regulations may affect the timing, amount and nature of restructuring and cost reduction programs in that region.
 Domestic and Foreign Operations
 We began international operations in 1927. Our products are manufactured and/or distributed through our consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates in the following countries:

 Financial information for geographic areas is included in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. More than 76% of our net sales are outside of the U.S. We sell products into approximately 109 countries.
 Our U.S. parent company receives technical service fees and/or royalties from many of its foreign subsidiaries. As a matter of corporate policy, the foreign subsidiaries have historically been expected to remit a portion of their annual earnings to the U.S. parent company as dividends. To the extent earnings of foreign subsidiaries are not remitted to the U.S. parent company, those earnings are indefinitely re-invested in those subsidiaries.
