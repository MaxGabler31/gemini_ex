ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General Information

Noble Roman’s, Inc., an Indiana corporation incorporated in 1972, sells and services franchises and licenses and operates Company-owned stand-alone restaurants and non-traditional foodservice operations under the trade names “Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub,” “Noble Roman’s Pizza,”“Noble Roman’s Take-N-Bake,” and “Tuscano’s Italian Style Subs.”  References in this report to the “Company” are to Noble Roman’s, Inc. and its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, RH Roanoke, Inc. and Pizzaco, Inc., unless the context requires otherwise.  RH Roanoke, Inc. operates a Company-owned non-traditional location.  Pizzaco, Inc. currently is dormant. 

The Company has been operating, franchising and licensing Noble Roman’s Pizza operations in a variety of stand-alone and non-traditional locations across the country since 1972.  Its first Craft Pizza & Pub location opened in January 2017 as a Company-operated restaurant in a northern suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana.  Since then, the Company opened a total of eight more Company-operated locations in 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021, with additional locations under consideration.  The Company-operated locations serve as the base for what it sees as a signficiant potential future growth driver, including additional Company operated locations and franchising its full-service restaurant format to experienced, multi-unit restaurant operators with a track record of success.  In 2019 the Company executed an agreement with the first franchise operator, Indiana’s largest Dairy Queen franchisee with 19 franchised Dairy Queen locations at that time.  The franchisee opened the first franchised Craft Pizza & Pub location in May 2019 and another location in November 2020.  In November 2019, another franchisee, with an operations background in McDonald's, opened a Craft Pizza & Pub  in Evansville, Indiana.  

As discussed below under “Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic” the COVID-19 pandemic materially affected the Company’s business and its franchising strategy since the pandemic emerged during the first quarter of 2020.

Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub

The Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub format incorporates many of the basic elements first introduced in 1972 but in a modern atmosphere with up-to-date technology and equipment to maximize speed, enhance quality and perpetuate the taste customers love and expect from a Noble Roman’s. 

The Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub provides for a selection of over 40 different toppings, cheeses and sauces from which to choose.  Beer and wine also are featured, with 16 different beers on tap including both national and local craft selections.  Wines include 16 affordably priced options by the bottle or glass in a range of varietals.  Beer and wine service is provided at the bar and throughout the dining room.

The Company designed the system to enable fast cook times, with oven speeds running approximately 2.5 minutes for traditional pizzas and 5.75 minutes for Sicilian pizzas. Popular pizza favorites such as pepperoni are options on the menu but also offered is a selection of Craft Pizza & Pub original pizza creations.  The menu also features a selection of contemporary and fresh, made-to-order salads and fresh-cooked pasta.  The menu also incorporates baked sub sandwiches, hand-sauced wings and a selection of desserts, as well as Noble Roman’s famous Breadsticks with Spicy Cheese Sauce, most of which has been offered in its locations since 1972.

Additional enhancements include a glass enclosed “Dough Room” where Noble Roman’s Dough Masters hand make all pizza and breadstick dough from scratch in customer view.  Kids and adults enjoy Noble Roman’s self-serve root beer tap, which is also part of a special menu for customers 12 and younger. Throughout the dining room and the bar area there are many giant screen television monitors for sports and the nostalgic black and white shorts featured in Noble Roman’s since 1972. 

The Company designed its curbside service for carry-out customers, called “Pizza Valet Service,” to create added value and convenience.  With Pizza Valet Service, customers place orders ahead, drive into the restaurant’s reserved valet parking spaces and have their pizza run to their vehicle by specially uniformed pizza valets.  Customers who pay when they place their orders are able to drive up and leave with their order very quickly without stepping out of their vehicle.  For those who choose to pay after they arrive, pizza valets can take credit card payments on their mobile payment devices right at the customer's vehicle.  With the fast baking times, the entire experience, from order to pick-up can take as little as 12 minutes.

Noble Roman’s Pizza For Non-Traditional Locations

In 1997, the Company started franchising non-traditional locations (a Noble Roman’s pizza operation within some other host business or activity with existing traffic) such as entertainment facilities, hospitals, convenience stores and other types of facilities. These locations utilize the two pizza styles the Company started with in 1972, along with its great tasting, high quality ingredients and menu extensions. 

The hallmark of Noble Roman’s Pizza for non-traditional locations is “Superior quality that our customers can taste.”  Every ingredient and process has been designed with a view to produce superior results.  


· | A fully-prepared pizza crust that captures the made-from-scratch pizzeria flavor which gets delivered to non-traditional locations in a shelf-stable condition so that dough handling is no longer an impediment to a consistent product, which otherwise is a challenge in non-traditional locations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Fresh packed, uncondensed and never cooked sauce made with secret spices, parmesan cheese and vine-ripened tomatoes in all venues. 
· | 100% real cheese blended from mozzarella and Muenster, with no additives or extenders. 
· | 100% real meat toppings, with no soy additives or extenders, a distinction compared to many pizza concepts. 
· | Vegetable and mushroom toppings are sliced and delivered fresh, never canned. 
· | An extended product line that includes breadsticks and cheesy stix with dip, pasta, baked sandwiches, salads, wings and a line of breakfast products. 
· | The fully-prepared crust also forms the basis for the Company’s Take-N-Bake pizza for use as an add-on component for its non-traditional franchise base as well as an offering for its grocery store license venue. 

Business Strategy

The Company is focused on revenue expansion while carefully managing corporate-level overhead expenses.  To accomplish this the Company plans to continue developing, owning and operating Craft Pizza & Pub locations and franchising that format to qualified multi-unit franchisees.  At the same time, the Company will continue to focus on franchising/licensing for non-traditional locations by franchising that format primarily to convenience stores and entertainment centers.

The initial franchise fees for a Noble Roman’s Pizza non-traditional location or a Craft Pizza & Pub location are as follows: 


 | Non-Traditional Except Hospitals | | Non-TraditionalHospitals | | | TraditionalStand-Alone
--------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+-------+--------------------------+---+--------+-----------------------
Either a Noble Roman’s Pizza or Craft Pizza & Pub | $ | 7,500 | | $ | 10,000 | | $ | 30,000 | (1)

_____________ 
(1)  With the sale of multiple traditional stand-alone franchises to a single franchisee, the franchise fee for the first unit is $30,000, the franchise fee for the second unit is $25,000 and the franchise fee for the third unit and any additional unit is $20,000.

The franchise fees are paid upon signing the franchise agreement and, when paid, are non-refundable in consideration of the administration and other expenses incurred by the Company in granting the franchises and for the lost and/or deferred opportunities to grant such franchises to any other party.

The Company’s proprietary ingredients are manufactured pursuant to the Company’s recipes and formulas by third-party manufacturers under contracts between the Company and its various manufacturers.  These contracts require the manufacturers to produce ingredients meeting the Company’s specifications and to sell them to Company-approved distributors at prices negotiated between the Company and the manufacturer.

The Company utilizes distributors it has strategically identified across the United States.  The distributor agreements require the distributors to maintain adequate inventories of all ingredients necessary to meet the needs of the Company’s franchisees and licensees in their distribution areas for weekly deliveries.

Competition

The restaurant industry and the retail food industry in general are very competitive with respect to convenience, price, product quality and service. In addition, the Company competes for franchise and license sales on the basis of product engineering and quality, investment cost, cost of sales, distribution, simplicity of operation and labor requirements. Actions by one or more of the Company’s competitors could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to sell additional franchises or licenses, maintain and renew existing franchises or licenses, or sell its products. Many of the Company’s competitors are very large, internationally established companies.

Within the environment in which the Company competes, management has identified what it believes to be certain competitive advantages for the Company.  Many of the Company’s competitors in the non-traditional venue were established with little or no organizational history operating traditional foodservice locations.  This lack of operating experience may limit their ability to attract and maintain non-traditional franchisees or licensees who, by the nature of the venue, often have little exposure to foodservice operations themselves.  The Company’s background in traditional restaurant operations has provided it experience in structuring, planning, marketing, and controlling costs of franchise or license unit operations which may be of material benefit to franchisees or licensees.  

The Company’s Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub format competes with similar restaurants in its service area. Some of the competitors are company-owned, some are franchised locations of large chains and others are independently owned. Some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the Company.

Seasonality of Sales

Severe winter weather conditions tend to adversely affect sales, especially those of the Craft Pizza & Pubs which are designed for in-store dining and carry-out, which in turn affects Company revenue.  Sales of non-traditional franchises or licenses may be affected by weather and holiday periods.  Sales to certain non-traditional venues may be slower around major holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, and during the first quarter of the year.  Product sales of the non-traditional franchises/licenses may be slower during the first quarter of the year.  Certain venues such as grocery stores are typically slower during the summer months.
Human Capital

As of March 1, 2022, the Company employed approximately 44 persons full-time and 163 persons on a part-time, hourly basis, of which 14 of the full-time employees are employed in sales and service of the franchise/license units and 30 in restaurant locations.  No employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes that relations with its employees are good.
Trademarks and Service Marks

The Company owns and protects several trademarks and service marks.  Many of these, including NOBLE ROMAN’S®, Noble Roman’s Pizza®, THE BETTER PIZZA PEOPLE®, “Noble Roman’s Take-N-Bake Pizza,”“Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub®,” “Pizza Valet”and “Tuscano’s Italian Style Subs®,” are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as with the corresponding agencies of certain other foreign governments.  The Company believes that its trademarks and service marks have significant value and are important to its sales and marketing efforts.
Government Regulation

The Company and its franchisees and licensees are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting the operation of the respective businesses. Each location, including the Company’s Craft Pizza & Pub locations, are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety, sanitation, building, employment, alcohol and other agencies and ordinances in the state or municipality in which the facility is located. The process of obtaining and maintaining required licenses or approvals can delay or prevent the opening of a location. Vendors, such as thirdparties that produce and distribute products and our franchisees and licensees sell are also licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and the U. S. Department of Transportation. The Company, its franchisees, licensees and vendors are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, as well as laws and regulations relating to minimum wage and other employment-related matters.  The Company is subject to various local, state and/or federal laws requiring disclosure of nutritional and/or ingredient information concerning the Company’s products, its packaging, menu boards and/or other literature. Changes in the laws and rules applicable to the Company or its franchisees or licensees, or their interpretation, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and various state agencies pursuant to federal and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several states also regulate aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires the Company to furnish to prospective franchisees a disclosure document containing specified information. Several states also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of a franchise disclosure document with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for additional federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects.  State laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship, and the Company is subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction where it seeks to market additional franchised units.

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

In the first quarter of 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged and spread throughout the United States. The World Health Organization recognized COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020. In response to the pandemic, the U.S. federal government and various state and local governments have, among other things, imposed and continue to impose travel and business restrictions, including stay-at-home orders and other guidelines that required restaurants and bars to close or restrict inside dining. The pandemic has resulted in significant, economic volatility, uncertainty and disruption, reduced commercial activity and weakened economic conditions in the regions in which the Company and its franchisees operate. 

The pandemic and the governmental response has had a significant adverse impact on the Company, due to, among other things, governmental restrictions, reduced customer traffic, staffing challenges and supply difficulties. All Company-owned Craft Pizza & Pub restaurants are located in the State of Indiana. On March 16, 2020, by order of the Governor of the State of Indiana (the “Governor”), all restaurants within Indiana were ordered to close for inside dining.  Due to the order, all Craft Pizza & Pub restaurants were open for carry-out only through April 30, 2020, primarily through the Company’s Pizza Valet system and third-party delivery providers.  On May 1, 2020, the Governor issued another order allowing restaurants to be open for inside dining for up to 50% of capacity as of May 11, 2020, and on June 14, 2020 up to 75% of capacity, plus bars were allowed to open up to 50% of capacity, and on July 4, 2020 restaurants and bars were to be allowed to resume at 100% capacity.  The Governor delayed the increase in capacity for a portion of the third quarter.  Ultimately the Governor issued another order to allow 100% capacity for restaurants and bars but required certain social distancing rules which effectively limit capacity to much less than 100%.  As the duration and scope of the pandemic is uncertain these orders are subject to further modification, which could adversely affect the Company.  Further, the Company can provide no assurance the phase out of restrictions will have a positive effect on the Company’s business.

Many other states and municipalities in the United States have also from time to time restricted travel and suspended the operation of dine-in restaurants and other businesses in light of COVID-19, which has negatively affected our franchised operations. Host facilities for our non-traditional franchises have also been adversely impacted by these developments. The uncertainty and disruption in the U.S. economy caused by the pandemic are likely to continue to adversely impact the volume and resources of potential franchisees for both the Company’s Craft Pizza & Pub and non-traditional venues even as/if the pandemic recedes.

In 2020, in light of the additional uncertainty created as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company decided to create a reserve for uncollectability on all long-term franchisee receivables. The Company will continue to pursue collection where circumstances are appropriate and all collections of these receivables in the future will result in additional income at the time received.

On April 25, 2020, the Company received a loan of $715,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”).  In accordance with the applicable accounting policy adopted, the Company accounted for the loan as a government grant and  presented it in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as a reduction of certain qualifying expenses incurred during the three-month period ended June 30, 2020.  The expenses included payroll costs and benefits, interest on mortgage obligations, rent under lease agreements and utilities and other qualifying expenses pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Securities Act (the “CARES Act”).  On February 19, 2021, the Company received formal notice from the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) that the entire $715,000 loan was forgiven in accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act.  On February 5, 2021, the Company received an additional loan of $940,734 under the PPP.  The Company used the proceeds of this loan for qualifying expenses under the CARES Act.  The Company received formal notice that this loan was forgiven on November 19, 2021 in its entirety.  

The pandemic also caused numerous supply chain issues and emergencies, which peaked in number during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022.  However the Company was able to work around all of these various emergencies without curtailing the ability of units to operate with full menus.  The scope and frequency of these emergencies required consistent time and attention from corporate staff.

The pandemic and government response also directly or indirectly created significant labor staffing issues for the Company-owned Craft Pizza & Pub restaurants as well as for the operations of franchised and licensed locations across the country.  Many hourly employees and salaried managers exited employment from time to time, became ill with COVID-19 or were isolating after exposure to COVID-19.  The Company solved these emergency staffing situations through aggressive recruiting, use of corporate staff to cover shortages and by shifting labor from one operation to another.  The scope and frequency of these emergencies required consistent time and attention from corporate staff.  Many franchisees and licensees still suffer from labor shortages, which had and, in many cases still have a negative impact on their underlying business as well as their Noble Roman’s Pizza operation.
