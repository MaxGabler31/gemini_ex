Item 1. Business.
Description of Business
Tupperware Brands Corporation ("Tupperware," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a leading global consumer products company that designs innovative, functional, and environmentally responsible products. Founded in 1946, the Company's signature container created the modern food storage category that revolutionized the way the world stores, serves, and prepares food. Today, this iconic brand has more than 8,500 functional design and utility patents for solution-oriented kitchen and home products. With a purpose to nurture a better future, the Company's products are an alternative to single-use items. The Company distributes its products into nearly 70 countries primarily through approximately 3.1 million independent sales force members around the world with approximately 553 thousand active at any designated point in time. Worldwide, the Company engages in the marketing, manufacture, and sale of design-centric preparation, storage, and serving solutions for the kitchen and home through the Tupperware brand name. The Company primarily uses a direct selling business model to distribute and market products, while continuing to expand digital platforms and business-to-business distribution channels. Through personal connections, product demonstrations, and understanding of consumer needs, the Company's sales force members have been selling products to customers for over 75 years. The Company is a Delaware corporation that was organized on February 8, 1996 in connection with the corporate reorganization of Premark International, Inc. ("Premark").
As of September 25, 2021, the Company has classified the results of certain key brands of the beauty business including Avroy Shlain, House of Fuller, Nutrimetics, and Nuvo as held for sale and as discontinued operations. As such, the results of the beauty businesses are reflected as discontinued operations including all comparative prior period information in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 13, Held for Sale Assets and Discontinued Operations, for additional information.
Turnaround Plan Update
In 2021, under the leadership of President & Chief Executive Officer Miguel Fernandez, the Company continued to build the foundation to execute on a new growth strategy, one that leverages consumer acceptance of the iconic Tupperware brand and gives the Company the ability to expand into new product categories, increase consumer access points and grow distribution channels, all while strengthening the Company’s core direct selling business. The Company continued to execute on its three-year Turnaround Plan(a) with progress that included improvements in liquidity and strengthening of the capital structure through the sale of non-core assets; restructuring and refinancing the Company’s debt; and the utilization of share repurchase authorization. The key elements of the Turnaround Plan continue to focus on: structurally fixing the Company’s core business to create a more sustainable business model; shifting from a distributor push model to a consumer pull model to capture the needs of today’s customer sets; opening up access to Tupperware products in channels where today’s consumers want to shop; and expanding into new product categories to bring more innovative solutions to the market. The management team has made significant progress on these key elements of the Turnaround Plan all while continuing to evolve and deal with the continuing and changing impact on the world affected by COVID-19.

COVID-19
Since early 2020, the Company has followed guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") and the World Health Organization ("WHO") on actions required by individuals and businesses following the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic. Since 2020 the pandemic has impacted worldwide economic activity and many governments implemented policies intended to stop or slow the further spread of the disease. These policies, such as shelter-in-place orders, travel restrictions, and quarantine requirements, remained in place for a significant period of time, resulting in the temporary closure of schools and non-essential businesses and restrictions on travel and in-person gatherings. The Company has continued to respond by taking actions to keep employees protected, support the Company's global sales force and their communities, and maintain business continuity. 
On November 4, 2021, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") issued an Emergency Temporary Standard ("ETS") mandating that employers with more than 100 employees require covered employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or wear face coverings and submit weekly COVID-19 test results. On January 13, 2022, the United States Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction blocking the ETS pending further review by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Company will continue to monitor federal, state, and local legislative and regulatory developments to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company is implementing its own vaccine mandate for its worksites in the United States with exemptions in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including the laws of the States of Florida and South Carolina.
A top priority for the Company as it continues to navigate the impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic is the safety of its employees and their families, sales force and consumers, and to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on its operations and financial results. The Company will continue to proactively respond to the situation and may take further actions that alter the Company’s business operations as may be required by governmental authorities, or that the Company determines are in the best interests of its employees, sales force, and consumers. In order to ensure continued safety and protect the health of the employees, and to comply with applicable government directives, the Company has modified its business practices to allow its employees to work remotely, incorporate virtual meetings, and restrict all non-essential employee travel until further notice.
Liquidity and Capital Allocation
During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed the refinance of its credit facilities by securing $880.0 million in a new credit facility. The new facility consists of a five-year $480.0 million revolving credit facility and a five-year term loan including a U.S. dollar term loan of $200.0 million and a Euro term loan of €176.0 million. The Company used the aggregate borrowings to repay the outstanding balance of the previous credit agreement which was composed of a term loan and a revolver facility. The refinance transaction lowered the Company’s cost of capital with a reduction of the interest rate on the term loans by six percentage points, extended the maturity of the credit facility by two and a half years to 2026, and increased liquidity by approximately $100.0 million. The new credit facility enhances the financial flexibility and is consistent with the strategy to optimize the capital structure as part of the Turnaround Plan. The Company has also improved its overall liquidity by focusing on its core business while considering strategic alternatives for non-core assets, including divestitures of its beauty and personal care products businesses. The Company completed the sales of manufacturing facilities in Asia Pacific and Europe and the sale of its remaining properties surrounding its Company headquarters in Orlando, Florida in 2021.

I. Sales
Products
The Company primarily designs innovative, functional, and environmentally responsible products to help store, serve, and prepare food. The core of the Tupperware brand product line consists of design-centric preparation, storage, and serving solutions for the kitchen and home, in addition to lines of cookware, knives, microwave products, microfiber textiles, water-filtration related items, and an array of products for on-the-go consumers. The Company continues to focus on introducing new, more sustainable materials to its 
product lines; new products designed to solve consumer needs identified by data and insights; and a refined product strategy tied to the Company’s renewed purpose to helping consumers reduce food waste and eliminate the use of single-use plastic products and packaging.
The Company continues to be recognized for product innovation efforts. In 2021, Tupperware was honored for its Eco+ Coffee to Go Cup by Fast Company’s 2021 Innovation by Design Awards and the Green Good Design Award from The Chicago Athenaeum. The Handy Spiral also received high honors by the 2022 German Design Awards and received the 2021 IF Seal from the Industrie Forum Design, Hannover. In addition to these recognitions, the new product introductions in 2021 included:
•The XtremAqua™ Freezable Bottle, a high-impact resistant and freezer-proof solution for consumers on-the-go. The bottle offers up to eight hours of fridge-fresh cool water when frozen. The Company launched the 880ml bottle in a number of markets in 2021 including Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and across Europe, with plans to launch additional bottle sizes in 2022. 
•The Universal Cookware set, a product line developed for small kitchens and spaces. The set includes a frying pan and two sizes of stockpots that together take the space of just one pot with its ability to nest. The product launched in Mexico, South Africa, the Philippines, the United States and Canada, and across other Latin America markets. 
•The next generation of the popular SuperSonic™ Choppers designed to cut and chop food up to 5 times faster than using only a knife. The product, featuring Smart-Fast Bladez™ for powerful manual chopping in the kitchen, was introduced in the United States and Canada and across Europe.
•The Company continued to introduce Eco+ material, the umbrella for the Company’s more sustainable materials, including circular materials and bio-based materials. In 2021, Tupperware introduced a special limited edition product line with the National Park Foundation in the United States with a number of products made with Eco+ material, and also announced plans to expand its sustainable product portfolio with Eastman Tritan™ Renew, a material offering Tupperware the opportunity to design clear or transparent products with 50% certified recycled content without compromising on quality or clarity.
•The Company developed the strategy to expand its presence in the glass bakeware category given the current needs of today’s consumers and plan to launch new products in this area in 2022.
With its purpose to nurture a better future, in 2021 Tupperware brought to life its collaboration with TerraCycle's circular reuse platform, Loop, with its announcement to design and produce a one-of-a-kind reusable packaging container option for fast casual restaurant chain Tim Hortons, one of Loop's brand partners. The reusable container was created by Tupperware to package Tim Hortons' food menu items as part of a pilot program that launched in 2021 at select restaurant locations in Canada. 
II. Markets
The Company operates its business under four reportable segments in four broad geographic regions: (1) Asia Pacific, (2) Europe (Europe, Africa and the Middle East), (3) North America, and (4) South America. See Note 22: Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report for further details regarding segment information.
Sales are to the ultimate customer principally through direct selling by approximately 3.1 million independent sales force members with approximately 553 thousand active at any designated point in time. Products are primarily sold directly to independent distributors, directors, managers, and dealers (the "sales force") throughout the world. Sales force members purchase products at a discount from the Company and then sell them to their customers. Sales methods can differ based on the market.
A significant portion of the Company's business is operated through distributors, some of whom stock inventory and fulfill orders from the sales force that are generally placed after orders have been received from their customers. In a stocking model, the distributor orders product, stocks it in a warehouse and picks, packs, and ships it to the sales force for distribution to the end consumer. In a non-stocking model, the distributor’s focus is on increasing the sales force size while the Company manages the stocking and distribution of inventory. Discounts to the distributor are adjusted depending on the level of service provided. Where distributorships are granted, they have the right to market the Company's products and to utilize Tupperware's trademarks, subject to certain limitations. The vast majority of the sales force members are independent contractors and not employees of the Company. 
Some business units utilize a campaign merchandising system whereby sales force members sell through brochures generated every two or three weeks to their circle of influence including friends, neighbors, and relatives. The brochures highlight new products and specially-priced items for each sales campaign and allow the sales force to connect one-on-one with the consumer. Generally, the sales force forwards an order to a designated Tupperware distribution center where the product is packaged and shipped to the sales force for delivery to the consumer. 
The Company also uses retail stores and studios, owned by independent sales force members, in certain markets, most predominantly in China. These physical locations provide an entrepreneurial opportunity for independent owners to connect with consumers to demonstrate and sell products while also creating visibility and reinforcing Tupperware’s image with consumers. As of December 25, 2021, the Company's products in China could be purchased at over 5 thousand locations with approximately 500 additional stores or studios located in other parts of the world. As part of the Company's Turnaround Plan, the new growth strategy will expand to offer additional in-person product purchasing opportunities to complement the current retail store and studio strategy.
Accelerated by the global pandemic, the Company has seen a worldwide shift by its sales force to incorporate digital methods of doing business. The adoption of digital demonstrations has grown as a result of more people staying at home, thus enabling a sales force member’s ability to reach new customers. Geographic location is no longer a limiting factor for the Company's independent sales force members and the Company sees this adoption of digital tools and methods to selling as a key element of building a more sustainable and predictable business. In both 2020 and 2021, Tupperware provided its sales force with various digital tools to connect with consumers directly through social media and personalized web pages, offered digital training and virtual meetings for sales force development, and maintained direct websites in several countries including, but not limited to, Brazil, Mexico, and the United States and Canada for consumers to purchase products. As of December 25, 2021, the Company's distribution system had approximately 2 thousand distributors, 94 thousand managers (including directors and team leaders) and 3.1 million independent sales force members worldwide with approximately 553 thousand active at any designated point in time.
Business Strategy
As its business strategy evolves, as part of the Turnaround Plan, the Company is focused on accelerating modernization in two areas. First is improving the core direct sales business, introducing a data-driven approach to sales force marketing, communication and recruitment, and introducing new digital tools and training to make doing business more efficient. The Company is working on an approach to personalize the customer experience based on consumer behaviors and has defined two distinct groups within its sales force – those who want to build a business or career with the Company (the "Business Builders"), and those who want access to discounted or exclusive products (the "Preferred Buyers"). Future communications, service, support, and marketing approach will be tailored with these segmented audiences in mind.
Second, the Company is focused on business expansion opportunities, by shifting from a business model reliant solely on the direct sales channel to drive consumer demand, to a business model that creates a natural "pull and push" to the brand to lift up all channels in which Company products are available. This includes expanding into more product categories where the Tupperware brand is in demand and creating more access points for consumers to purchase Company products – both in person and online. 
Company efforts are underway in creating a consumer-tailored product and pricing strategy intended to reach and address the needs of all consumer socioeconomic levels, while also exploring alternative revenue streams for incremental business-to-business opportunities and new licensing opportunities to leverage the value of its iconic brand. This strategy is designed to create additional brand awareness and create new leads for the Company’s independent sales force and increase revenue from channels and consumers that the Tupperware brand does not reach today.
III. Competition
The Company has many competitors both domestically and internationally. The principal bases of competition generally are marketing, price, quality, and innovation of products, as well as competition with other companies for independent sales force. Due to the nature of the direct selling industry, it is critical that the Company provides a compelling earnings opportunity for the sales force, along with developing new and innovative products. The Company maintains its competitive position, in part, through a focus on product design, quality, and innovation, as well as the use of strong incentives and promotional programs.
Through its Tupperware brand, the Company competes in the food storage, serving and preparation, containers, children's toys and gifts categories. The Company works to differentiate itself from its competitors through its brand names, product innovation, quality, value-added services, celebrity endorsements, technological sophistication, new product introductions, and its channel of distribution, including the training, motivation, and compensation arrangements for its independent sales force.
IV. Resources
Many of the products manufactured by and for the Company require specialty polymers including plastic resins that meet its rigorous design and quality specifications. These resins are purchased through various arrangements with a number of large chemical companies located in many of the markets in which the Company has a presence or sells its products. Research and development relating to these polymers and resins used in Tupperware brand name products is performed by both the Company and its suppliers. In 2020 and 2021, the Company experienced shipping constraints and delays coming from sourced suppliers due to COVID-19. To date, the Company has been able to secure an adequate supply of raw materials for its products, and it endeavors to maintain relationships with backup suppliers in an effort to ensure that no interruptions occur in its operations.
The Company considers its trademarks and patents to be of material importance to its business. Except for the Tupperware trademark, which the Company considers to be among its most valuable assets, the Company is not dependent upon any single patent or trademark, or group of patents or trademarks. The Tupperware trademark, as well as its other trademarks, is registered on a country-by-country basis. The current duration for such registration ranges from five years to ten years; however, each such registration may be renewed an unlimited number of times. The patents used in the Company's business are registered and maintained on a country-by-country basis, with a variety of durations. The Company has followed the practice of applying for design and utility patents with respect to most of its significant patentable developments.
V. Government Regulations
Compliance with government regulations, including those relating to environmental protection, has not had in the past, and is not expected to have in the future, a material effect upon the Company's capital expenditures, liquidity, earnings, or competitive position.
VI. Human Capital
As of December 25, 2021, the Company had approximately 10,000 employees. Given the ongoing impacts of the COVID pandemic, the Company’s first priority continues to be on helping employees stay safe and adhering to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") and the World Health Organization ("WHO") on actions required by individuals and businesses to protect employees, support our global sales force and maintain business continuity. Over the course of 2021, the Company kept employees informed of regulations governing remote work, travel, use of personal protective equipment whether in the office or in a factory setting, with communication lines open for all employees to ask questions or raise concerns. Tupperware also supported in transitioning employees where possible to remote working arrangements, providing them with necessary equipment and tools. 
Despite the impacts on working arrangements and operations, the Company continues to reinforce its guiding principles that were defined by the new leadership team in 2020 and in support of the Company’s three-year Turnaround Plan. With a set of core values defined as "doing what’s right, always improving, and succeeding together," the Company continued to support this vision for people management to ensure alignment to the strategy. The Company upheld five core areas related to human capital in order to create and maintain a performance-driven culture with employee pride:
•Design and build an effective organization that achieves results.
•Introduce management by objectives and service level agreements to reinforce performance and accountability.
•Establish new practices for selecting, assessing, and developing the right talent to build a high performance team.
•Set the basis for a value-based culture of full accountability and excellence.
•Create incentive programs aligned to Company strategy and motivate through rewards and recognition.
The following initiatives were key highlights for the Company in 2021:
•Aligning human resources processes throughout the Company to provide a single framework in which all business regions can operate effectively allowing efficient, consistent, and comparable performance management. This is supported by new corporate centers of excellence to lead best practice in human resources disciplines such as recruitment, performance management, and leadership development.
•Adopting management by objectives frameworks to support performance enhancement, compensation, incentive programs, and talent planning.
•Introducing more flexibility around when and where to work, reflecting a new model that proved successful during the COVID-19 pandemic. TuppFlex is a new policy that provides more flexible working hours and increases the support for remote working arrangements for employees.
•Integrating an unconditional responsibility mindset among the leadership teams as a basis to drive accountability and ownership across the organization to enable success under the Turnaround Plan.
•Improving recognition to drive further engagement and reward contribution through a new global recognition and rewards program, TuppSTAR, aligning with the Company’s principles, values, and core competencies to help reinforce a culture of accountability, inclusion, and celebrating success. 
•Enhancing communication tools to ensure everyone is connected and has the right information to do their job, including monthly Global Town Halls, global organization updates and new hire announcements, monthly global newsletters, as well as a robust intranet with resources and information.
•Enhancing the Company’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ("DEI") efforts to further foster an inclusive workplace where everyone has the opportunity to feel welcomed, valued and contribute to the best of their potential. In 2021, the Company established a target to be globally recognized for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace through achieving certification by a globally-recognized intersectional equity standard by 2030. As of December 25, 2021, women hold 60% of the company's executive and management roles and more than half of the independent members of the Board of Directors are women.
VII. Environmental, Social and Governance
Our Commitment to ESG
For over 75 years, the Company has provided alternatives to single-use plastic products, has offered career paths and opportunities for women, and has been committed to gender and racial diversity. In 2020, Tupperware Brands embarked on a three-year Turnaround Plan to deliver long-term profitable growth and part of that strategy was to build upon the foundational sustainability story of the iconic brand. 
The Company started with redefining its purpose to more closely align with its more than seven decade commitment to being "environmentally friendly," which reflect the concerns, desires, and needs of consumers for more reusable, durable, and environmentally-friendly products. With this purpose to nurture a better future every day, the Company expects to make decisions that benefit people, the planet, and communities served by the Company and its sales force.
In 2021, the Company built upon this foundation by conducting a new materiality assessment for environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") initiatives to inform developments in the Company’s business strategy and new stakeholder expectations in the wake of the impacts of COVID-19. The exercise informed Tupperware’s definition of priority ESG topics and a revised ESG strategy and associated targets. 
Highlights of Tupperware’s progress and focus areas to enhance its ESG strategy and priorities include the following:
•In December 2021, the Company published the tenth sustainability report reflecting the priority sustainability impacts of the business on stakeholders that were defined in the new materiality assessment conducted in 2021. The report outlines the Company’s plans to expand commitments to ESG efforts as the Turnaround Plan progresses. The report includes for the first time, Social and Governance goals and newly established 2025 and 2030 targets, including 90% absolute reduction of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions by 2030. The new ESG targets published in this recent report are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 5, 6, 12, and 13. The report was prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative ("GRI") Standards and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") Standard for the containers and packaging industry in the resource transformation sector.
•Executed a premier sponsorship with the National Park Foundation ("NPF") to support efforts to enhance environmental stewardship with a focus on reusable products and waste reduction across the National Park System ("NPS"). With the national parks seeing more than 300 million annual visitors, parks are experiencing an increased strain on resources, particularly waste infrastructure. Tupperware’s first year of sponsorship of NPF created meaningful impact across the NPS and offered critical support for new water bottle refill station installations, recycling and composting infrastructure, and education across NPS sites in the United States in 2021.
•Entered a partnership with TerraCycle’s reuse platform Loop to advance the mission to shift consumer behavior from buying consumer goods in disposable packaging to purchasing goods in durable, reusable packaging. In 2021, Tupperware created one-of-a-kind reusable packaging for Restaurant Brand International's Tim Hortons as part of its partnership with Loop. Aimed at reducing packaging waste through a circular recycling system, the reusable container was created by Tupperware to package Tim Hortons' food menu items as part of a pilot program at select locations in Canada.
•The Company continued to be recognized for its commitment to ESG by being named to Newsweek’s list of America’s Most Responsible Companies for the second year in a row. Tupperware was also honored in 2021 by Fast Company in the outlet’s first ever Brands That Matter list, honoring brands that do more than sell products or provide services. This new recognition 
program honors brands achieving relevance through cultural impact, social engagement, and authentic communication of their mission and ideals.
VIII. Other
On a quarterly basis, sales are impacted by holiday schedules, vacations by sales force members, as well as promotional activities during these periods, which vary by market. The Company's business is not dependent on a small number of customers, nor is any of its business subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the United States government.
