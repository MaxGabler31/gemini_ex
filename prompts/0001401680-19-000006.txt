Item 1. | Business

Overview
Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. was incorporated on May 24, 1999 in the state of Delaware and began its principal operations in November 1999. Unless the context requires otherwise, the words “Cornerstone,” “we,” “Company,” “us” and “our” refer to Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
We were founded with a passion for empowering people through learning and a conviction that people should be an organization's greatest competitive advantage. We are a global human capital management leader with a core belief that companies thrive when they help their employees to realize their potential. Putting this belief into practice, we offer solutions to help companies strategically manage and continuously develop their talent throughout the entire employee lifecycle. Featuring comprehensive recruiting, personalized learning, development-driven performance management, and holistic HR planning, our human capital management platform is successfully used by more than 3,535 global clients of all sizes, spanning more than 40 million users across 192 countries and 43 languages. 
We work with clients across all geographies, verticals and market segments. Our clients include multi-national corporations, large domestic and foreign-based enterprises, mid-market companies, public sector organizations, healthcare providers, higher education institutions, non-profit organizations and small businesses. We sell our platform domestically and internationally through both direct and indirect channels, including direct sales teams throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific and distributor relationships with payroll companies, human resource consultancies and global system integrators.

Cornerstone Learning comprehensively supports compliance, knowledge sharing, and employee-driven development training to close skills gaps.

The Market
The Human Capital Management (“HCM”) technology market is one of the largest in the software industry. According to an International Data Corporation (“IDC”) market forecast report, titled “Worldwide Human Capital Management and Payroll Applications Forecast, 2017-2021,” published in June 2017, the global market for Human Capital Management and Payroll Applications in 2018 was predicted to be $19.7 billion, of which $15 billion is for HCM applications. According to IDC, the HCM application market in particular is expected to grow to $19.7 billion by 2021, representing a 9.0% CAGR, and includes payroll, HR, talent acquisition, workforce management, document management, performance management, compensation management, and succession planning.
The global corporate training market is also one of the largest in the software industry. According to a Training Industry, Inc. report, titled “The Anatomy of the Modern Learning System,” global spend on corporate training initiatives was estimated to be $362 billion in 2017, of which approximately $25 billion was spent on third-party external training courses in North America.  
Our Human Capital Management Platform
Our human capital management platform is a comprehensive Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solution that consists of four integrated suites to help organizations manage their recruiting, learning, performance and HR administration processes. These suites are supplemented by state-of-the-art analytics and reporting as well as a number of cross-product tools for employee profile management and e-learning content aggregation and delivery. We believe that our human capital management platform delivers the following benefits:

• | Comprehensive Functionality. Our platform provides a comprehensive approach to human capital management by offering products to address all stages of the employee lifecycle: recruiting, onboarding, learning, performance, succession, compensation, enterprise social collaboration and HR administration processes. Employees use our platform throughout their careers to engage in performance processes such as goal management, performance reviews, continuous feedback, competency assessments and compensatory reviews; to complete job-specific and compliance-related training; to evaluate potential career changes, development plans or succession processes; and to connect and collaborate with co-workers by leveraging enterprise social networking tools. Employee managers and HR managers use our platform to perform their human capital administrative responsibilities effectively throughout their employees’ careers. We believe our comprehensive, unified platform enables our clients to align their human capital management processes and practices with their broader strategic goals.


• | Flexible and Highly Configurable. Our platform offers substantial configurability that allows our clients to match the use of our software with their specific business processes and workflows. We also provide web services to facilitate the importing and exporting of data to and from other client systems, such as enterprise resource planning and human resource information system platforms. Our clients can configure various features, functions and work flows in our platform by business unit, division, department, region, location, job position, pay grade, cost center, or self-defined organizational unit. Our clients are able to adjust features to configure specific processes, such as performance review workflows or training approvals, to match their existing or desired practices. This high level of configurability means that custom coding projects generally are not required to meet the diverse needs of our clients.


• | Easy-to-Use, Personalized User Interface. Our platform employs an intuitive user interface and may be personalized for the end user, typically based on position, division, pay grade, location, manager and particular use of the solution. This ease of use limits the need for end-user training, which we believe increases user adoption rates and usage.


• | Software-as-a-Service Solution Lowers the Total Cost of Ownership and Speeds Delivery. Our platform is accessible through a standard web browser and does not require the large investments in implementation time, personnel, hardware and consulting that are typical of hosted or on-premise solutions. With a single code base to maintain, we are able to release improved functionality on a quarterly basis. This is a more rapid pace than most hosted or on-premise solution providers can afford to deliver.


• | Scalable to Meet the Needs of Organizations. Our platform has been used by Fortune 100 companies since 2001. While the complex needs of these global corporations required us to build a solution that can scale to support large, geographically-distributed employee bases, our platform is capable of supporting deployments of various sizes. Today we service 40 multi-national corporations with over 150,000 active users each. Our largest deployment is for over 600,000 users.

• | Insights and Predictive Analysis. Our platform leverages technology powered by a highly refined machine learning system for human capital management. We also offer a large network of shared talent data. This enables leaders to answer critical questions about how to better hire, manage, retain, and reward talent with dashboards that can be drilled down to individual employees. Enhanced by additional Cornerstone suite usage, these insights allow organizations to manage their human capital proactively and be strategic with initiatives that affect thousands of employees across many groups and locations.


• | Continued Innovation through Collaborative Product Development. We work collaboratively with our clients on an ongoing basis to develop almost every part of our platform. The vast majority of our thousands of software features were designed using feedback from existing and prospective clients based on their specific functional requests.


• | Focus on Data Privacy. We have designed our platform to meet certain rigorous industry and jurisdictional security standards and to help assure clients that their sensitive data is protected across the system. We ensure high levels of security by logically segregating each client’s data from the data of other clients and by enforcing a consistent approach to roles and rights within the system. These restrictions limit system access to only those individuals authorized by our clients. We also employ multiple standard technologies, protocols and processes to monitor, test and certify the security of our infrastructure continuously.

Through this network, we are able to offer an extensive library of online training content to our clients through our Learning Experience Platform. Content Anytime is our proprietary, foundational e-learning content subscription which integrates seamlessly into Cornerstone Learning.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to empower people, organizations and communities to realize their potential with a comprehensive human capital management platform that is built to last. Our growth strategy since inception has been deliberate and focused on long-term success. This has allowed us to weather periods of economic turmoil and significant changes in the markets we serve without experiencing business contraction. We plan to continue with the same systematic approach in the future. Key elements of our strategy include:
Continue to Innovate and Extend Our Technological Leadership. We believe we have developed over the last twenty years a deep understanding of the human capital management challenges our clients face. We continually collaborate with our clients to build extensive functionality that addresses their specific needs and requests. We plan to continue to leverage our expertise in human capital management and client relationships to develop new products, features and functionality that will enhance our platform and expand our addressable market.
7

Retain and Expand Business with Existing Clients. We believe our existing installed base of clients offers a substantial opportunity for growth.

• | Focus on Client Success, Retention and Growth. We believe focusing on our clients’ success will lead to our own success. We have developed a Client Success Framework that governs our operating model. Since 2002, we have averaged annual gross dollar retention rates of approximately 95%. We strive to maintain our strong retention rates by continuing to provide our clients with high levels of service, support and increasing functionality.


• | Sell Additional Products to Existing Clients. We believe there is a significant growth opportunity in selling additional functionality to our existing clients. Many clients have added functionality subsequent to their initial deployments as they recognize the benefits of our unified platform. As a result, approximately 71% of our clients today utilize two or more products and approximately 41% utilize three or more products. With our expanding product portfolio functionality, we believe significant upsell opportunity remains within our existing client base.

Focus on Growing Recurring Revenue. Beginning in 2018, we focused our go-to-market capabilities on driving recurring revenue growth. We believe our primary growth drivers are as follows: 

• | Invest in Direct Sales in North America. We believe that the market for human capital management is large and remains significantly underpenetrated. In particular, Recruiting and Content provide an opportunity to increase our recurring sales to both new and existing clients. Additionally, we believe the Small and Medium-sized Business (SMB) market represents a very large and underpenetrated opportunity. 


• | Significantly Grow Our International Operation. We believe a substantial opportunity exists to continue to grow sales of our platform internationally. We intend to grow our Europe, Middle-East and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia-Pacific and Japan ("APJ") operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had 827 clients in EMEA and 198 clients in APJ.


• | Grow Our Cornerstone Content Anytime Sales. We believe there is a significant market opportunity for developing employees throughout their careers with modern, fresh e-learning content. Our Content Anytime subscription offering provides access to industry leading content which we believe will increase user engagement on our platform. Our content partners for Content Anytime include industry leaders as well as regional, functional and vertically-focused online training providers. In addition, we have agreements with providers of specific competency models for use by our clients directly in our human capital management platform. We intend to enter into additional license agreements to continue providing the best content available for our clients.


• | Expand the Ecosystem. During 2018, we migrated a sizable portion of our implementation services to our partners. We have also expanded in recent years our relationships with various third-party consulting firms to deliver the successful implementation of our platform and to optimize our clients’ use of our platform during the terms of their engagements. Our partner strategy and experience includes certifications and curricula developed to ensure successful delivery by our partners and continued high client satisfaction. We believe we have a significant opportunity to leverage these third-parties interested in building or expanding their businesses to increase our market penetration.

Increase Operating Income and Free Cash Flow. In November 2017, we announced a strategic plan designed to better position us for long-term growth and increase shareholder value. We believe managing our operating costs while making smart investments in scaling our middle and back-office operations to support recurring revenue growth is critical to our long-term success. We intend to focus on operational excellence initiatives that drive increases in operating income and free cash flow.
Acquisitions. We may acquire or invest in additional businesses, products or technologies that we believe will complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. Most recently, in November 2018, we acquired Grovo Learning, Inc., a leading provider of Microlearning® content, and in September 2018, we acquired Workpop Inc., a web and mobile solution for candidates and hiring managers in service-based industries. We completed these transactions to support our strategic initiatives to enhance the Recruiting and Content areas of our platform. 
Global Client Success
We are dedicated to the success of our clients. We have developed a Client Success Framework which governs our operational model, the structure of our Client Management teams and the types of services necessary at each stage of a client’s lifecycle.
Within this framework, we have developed the following roles with primary responsibility to our clients at various levels of their organizations:

• | Client Executives who interact with executive-level sponsors and human resources executives at a client and are focused on the overall relationship, including sales to existing clients;

8


• | Client Success Managers who work directly with executive-level sponsors and human resources executives at our clients to maximize the value of their investment in our human capital management platform; and


• | Product Specialists who interact with client administrators and are focused on features and functions of our human capital management platform.

We believe this life cycle driven approach to client support and client success has contributed directly to our high client retention rate and high rankings for client satisfaction in independent research studies.
We offer support in multiple languages, at multiple levels and through multiple channels, including global support coverage available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We use our own enterprise social collaboration product to provide our clients and distributors with a virtual community to collaborate on product design, release management and best practices.
We monitor client satisfaction internally as part of formalized programs and at regular intervals during the client lifecycle, including during the transition from sales to implementation, at the completion of a consulting project and daily based on interactions with our client-facing teams.
Technology, Operations and Research and Development
Our human capital management platform is designed and deployed with an on-demand, multi-tenant, and multi-user architecture which our clients access via a standard web browser. It currently uses a single code base, with all of our clients running on the current version of our software. We employ a modularized architecture to balance the load of clients on separate sub-environments, as well as to provide a flexible method for scalability without impacting other parts of the current environment. This architecture allows us to provide the high levels of uptime required by our clients. Our existing infrastructure has been designed with sufficient capacity to meet our current and estimated near term future needs. Global uptime in 2018 was 99.986%.
We physically host our human capital management platform for our clients in secure third-party data center facilities located in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. These facilities provide physical security, including biometric access controls and systems security, redundant power and environmental controls. 
We are continuing to build out services and functionality in the public cloud with a view to migrating more software to the public cloud over time. This strategy provides us flexibility to service customers in new and emerging regions and scale our deployment capabilities as we continue moving from a monolithic to a microservices architecture. We maintain the same or higher standards of security and compliance with our public cloud providers as we do in our leased facilities.
Our ability to compete depends largely on our continuous commitment to product development and ability to rapidly introduce new products, technologies, features, and functionality. The responsibilities of our research and development organization include product management, product development, quality assurance, IT security, and technology operations. Our research and development organization is global, with major engineering centers in the United States, Israel, New Zealand, and India. 
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We sell our software, content and services both directly through our sales force and indirectly through our domestic and international network of distributors. We currently service clients in a wide range of industries, including, among others business services, financial services, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, insurance, manufacturing, retail and high technology. We have a number of direct sales teams organized by market segment, industry vertical, and geographic regions such as the Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific and Japan. 
Our direct sales team is supported by product specialists who provide technical and product expertise to facilitate the sales process. Our sales enablement professionals provide on-boarding and ongoing professional development for the sales professionals to increase their effectiveness at selling in the field. We also maintain a separate team of client executives responsible for renewals and up-sales to existing clients.
Marketing
We manage global demand generation programs, develop sales pipelines and enhance brand awareness through our marketing initiatives. Our marketing programs target HR executives, technology professionals and senior business leaders. Our principal marketing initiatives include:
9


• | Demand Generation. Our demand generation activities include lead generation through email and direct mail campaigns, participation in industry events, securing event speaking opportunities and online marketing, including both SEM and organic SEO online marketing.


• | Corporate Marketing. We market to our clients by leveraging product marketing, client success stories, thought leadership content and brand awareness advertising campaigns. Additionally, we host regional client user group meetings and we also co-market with our strategic distributors, including joint press announcements and demand generation activities.


• | Marketing Communications. We undertake media relations, corporate communications, industry analyst relations activities, client advocacy and social media outreach.

Competition
The market for human capital management software is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented. This market is subject to changing technology, shifting client needs and frequent introductions of new products and services.
Most of our sales efforts are competitive, often involving requests for proposals. We compete primarily on the basis of providing a highly configurable, comprehensive, fully unified platform for human capital management as opposed to specific service offerings.
In the applicant tracking systems segment, which our Recruiting suite offerings serve, our principal competitors include companies such as Oracle Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation and Saba Software, Inc. (Lumesse). In the learning management systems segment, which our Learning suite offerings each serve, our principal competitors include companies such as Oracle Corporation, Saba Software, Inc., SAP America, Inc. and SkillSoft Corp. In the performance management systems segment, which our Performance suite offerings each serve, our principal competitors include companies such as Saba Software, Inc., Talentsoft SA, Oracle Corporation, Peoplefluent, Inc. and SAP America, Inc. These vendors are, like us, largely SaaS providers. We compete in these segments primarily on the basis of:

• | the level of integration of our product offerings within our human capital management platform;


• | the breadth and depth of our product functionality;


• | the flexibility and configurability of our product offerings to meet the changing content and workflow requirements of our clients’ business units;


• | the quality of our service and focus on client success;


• | our ability to provide scalability and flexibility for large and complex global deployments; and


• | the ease of use of our product offerings and overall user experience.

In addition, we occasionally compete with custom-built software that is designed to support the needs of a single organization, as well as with third-party talent and human resource application providers that focus on specific aspects of human capital management.
Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets than we do. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed” and “Risk Factors—Mergers of or other strategic transactions by our competitors could weaken our competitive position or reduce our revenue.”
Proprietary Rights
To safeguard our proprietary and intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws in the United States and in other jurisdictions and on contractual restrictions. We have confidentiality and license agreements with employees, contractors, clients, distributors and other third parties, which limit access to and use of our proprietary information and software.
Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees, creation of new suites, features and functionality, collaboration with our clients and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
10

Government Contracts
Many of our contracts with government agencies are subject to termination at the election of the government agency. While our government contracts generally do not provide for renegotiation of fees at the election of the government, it is possible that the government agency could request, and that we could under certain circumstances agree to, the renegotiation of the payments otherwise payable under such contracts. However, we have not in the past renegotiated significant payment terms under our government contracts. For additional information, see “Risk Factors-Our sales to government entities are subject to a number of additional challenges and risks.”
Seasonality
Our sales are seasonal in nature. We sign a higher percentage of agreements with new clients, as well as renewal agreements with existing clients, in the fourth quarter of each year. In addition, within a given quarter, we sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of that quarter. Our agreements generally come up for renewal at the same time of the year they were originally signed, which further amplifies the seasonal nature of our sales.
We believe this seasonality is driven by several factors, most notably the tendency of our clients’ procurement departments to purchase technology at the end of a quarter or calendar year, possibly in order to use up their available quarterly or annual funding allocations. 
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had 1,953 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage. We consider our relations with our employees to be strong. 
The Cornerstone OnDemand Foundation
To demonstrate our commitment to empowering people and communities, we helped form the Cornerstone OnDemand Foundation, or the Foundation, in 2010. The Foundation seeks to empower communities in the United States and internationally by increasing the impact of the non-profit sector through the utilization of our human capital management platform and capacity building programs.
The Foundation focuses its efforts on the areas of education, workforce development and disaster relief. We have enlisted the help of our employees, clients and distributors to support the Foundation in its efforts. The Foundation is designed to be self-sustaining over time through a variety of ongoing funding streams, such as donations, sponsorships and distribution fees.
