Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud™, Messaging, Digital and Enterprise platforms, products and solutions provide highly scalable automated on-demand, end-to-end order processing, transaction management, service provisioning, device activation, intelligent connectivity and content transfer, synchronization and social media, identity and access management, secure mobility management as well as enterprise-wide sharing/collaboration through multiple channels including e-commerce, m-commerce, telesales, enterprise, indirect, and retail outlets. Our technologies are designed to be flexible and scalable across a wide range of existing communication services and connected devices, while offering a best-in-class experience for our customers and supporting traditional and non-traditional devices. The extensible nature of our platforms enables our customers to rapidly respond to the ever changing and competitive nature of the telecommunications, enterprise and mobile marketplaces.
Our platforms, products and solutions manage transactions relating to a wide range of existing communications and digital content services across our customers. For example, we enable wireless providers to conduct business-to-consumer (“B2C”), business-to-business (“B2B”), enterprise and indirect channel (i.e.: resellers/dealers) transactions. The capabilities of our platforms are designed to provide our customers with the opportunity to improve operational performance and efficiencies, dynamically identify new revenue opportunities and rapidly deploy new services. They are also designed to provide customers the opportunity to improve performance and efficiencies for activation, content migration and connectivity management for connected devices.
Our various platforms are designed to be:
Carrier Grade: We design our platforms to handle high-volume transactions from carriers rapidly and efficiently, with virtually no down-time. Our platforms are also capable of simultaneously handling millions of device content related transactions on a daily basis to ensure that personal content on all subscriber devices stays fresh and synchronized with the Cloud.
Ease of Use: Our Platforms resolve complexity with back end data and system frameworks to create simple, easy use cases to end users and subscribers. Our Digital platform provides automation of device, product and service fulfillment - relieving manual work flows and providing economy of scale; it orchestrates data from various data and business silos to create new, elegant and powerful end user use cases that existing system frameworks cannot support. Our Messaging platform provides common onboarding for third party brands that allow them to create bots and other commerce instances and then manage them throughout the customer lifecycle. Our Cloud platform creates an easy cross platform sync and access to subscriber personal data. 
Highly Automated:  We design our platforms to eliminate manual processes and to automate otherwise labor-intensive tasks, thus improving operating efficiencies and order accuracy and cost reduction. By tracking every order and identifying those that 
8

are not provisioned properly, our platforms are designed to substantially reduce the need for manual intervention and reduce unnecessary customer service center calls. The technology of our platforms automatically guides a customer's request for service through the entire series of required steps.
Predictable and Reliable:  We are committed to providing high-quality, dependable services to our customers. To ensure reliability, system uptime and other service offerings, our transaction management is guaranteed through SLAs. Our platforms offer a complete customer management solution, including exception handling, which we believe is one of the main factors that differentiates us from our competitors. In performing exception handling, our platforms recognize and isolate transaction orders that are not configured to specifications, process them in a timely manner and communicate these orders back to our customers, thereby improving efficiencies and reducing backlog. In the past couple years, if manual intervention is required, our exception handling services are performed through outsourced to centers located in Canada and the United States and, where applicable, to other cost-effective geographies. Additionally, our database is designed to preserve data integrity while ensuring fast, efficient, transaction-oriented data retrieval methods. 
Seamless:  Our platforms integrate information across our customers' entire operation, including subscriber information, order information, delivery status, installation scheduling and content stored on the device to allow for the seamless activation and content transfer during the device purchase flow. Through our platforms, the device is automatically activated and consumer's content is available for use via the Cloud, ensuring continuity of service and reducing subscriber churn propensity. CSPs and multi-channel retailers can bundle additional applications during retail phone purchases, and also provide live updates to support new features and new devices. We have built our platforms using an open design with fully-documented software interfaces, commonly referred to as application programming interfaces (“API”). Our APIs enable our customers, strategic partners and other third parties to integrate our platforms with other software applications and to build best-in-class cloud-based applications incorporating third-party or customer-designed capabilities. Through our open design and alliance program, we believe we provide our customers with superior solutions that combine our technology with best-of-breed applications with the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of commercial, packaged interfaces.
Scalable:  Our platforms are designed to process expanding transaction volumes reliably and cost effectively. While our transaction volume has increased rapidly since our inception, we anticipate substantial future growth in transaction volumes, and we believe our platforms are capable of scaling their output commensurately, requiring principally routine computer hardware and software updates. Our synchronization and activation platforms routinely support our customers' transactions at the highest level of demands when needed with our current production deployments. We continue to see the number of transactions for connected devices, such as smartphones, mobile Internet devices (“MID”), laptops, tablets and wirelessly enabled consumer electronics such as cameras, tablets, e-readers, personal navigation devices, global positioning system (“GPS”) enabled devices, and other connected consumer electronics, to be one of the fastest growing transaction types across all our platforms, products and services. Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform is deployed across more than 95 million devices, managing 20 billion entities in the Cloud and performing more than 4 million synchronizations per day.
Value-add Reporting Tools:  Our platforms' attributes are tightly integrated into the critical workflows of our customers and have analytical reporting capabilities that provide near real-time information for every step of the relevant transaction processes. In addition to improving end-user customer satisfaction, these capabilities are designed to provide our customers with value-added insights into historical and current transaction trends. We also offer mobile reporting capabilities for users to receive critical data about their transactions on connected devices.
Build Consumer Loyalty and Create New Revenue Streams: Our synchronization services help drive consumers to the CSPs, OEM or multi-channel retailers by presenting them with a branded application and fully-integrated Web portal that provides convenience, security, and continuity for end user customers, which we believe helps our customers by further building the loyalty of their subscribers. Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud solution helps reduce subscriber churn by making it easy for subscribers to migrate smartphone content from an old device to a new device. Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud solution enables our carrier customers to sell premium value-add cloud storage solutions as well as cloud enabling premium partner opportunities. We are designing solutions that will allow carriers, OEMs and retail distributors to promote and fulfill new services through mobile channels to better monetize their cloud subscriber base. 
Efficient:  Our platforms' capabilities provide what we believe to be a more cost-effective, efficient and productive approach to enabling new activations across services and channels. Our solutions allow our customers to reduce overhead costs associated with building and operating their own customer transaction management infrastructure. With automated activation and integrated fall out support, our e-commerce platforms centralize customer service expectations, which we believe dramatically reduces our customers’ subscriber acquisition/retention costs in addition to operating expenses for training and staffing costs. We also provide our customers with the information and tools intended to more efficiently manage marketing and operational aspects of their business, as well as business intelligence required to do targeted up-selling of their products and services.

Quick Concept to Market Delivery:  The automation and ease of integration of our on-demand platform allows our customers to accelerate the deployment of their services and new service offerings by shortening the time between a subscriber's order and the provisioning of service or activation and enabling of a connected device(s).
Extensible and Relevant:  Our customers operate in dynamic and fast paced industries. Our platforms and solutions are built in a modular fashion, thereby conducive to be extended dynamically and enabling our customers to offer solutions that are relevant to current market situations, with the goal of providing them with the competitive edge required for them to be successful. The platforms are also designed to be highly customizable to each carrier’s specific back end systems as well as branding requirements.
Secure: By leveraging our identity and access management capabilities consumers can self register their identity, be verified and credentialed and manage their profile in order to have the best customer experience possible. This solution also supports identity proofing and scoring in order to conduct fraud and cyber security detection and prevention.

As the TMT and IoT industries evolve, new access networks, connected devices and applications with multiple services and modes are emerging that will provide growth markets for Synchronoss. This proliferation of services and advancement of technologies is accelerating subscriber revenue growth, significantly expanding the types and volume of rich content accessed and stored by consumers, and increasing the number of transactions between our customers and their subscribers. 
Growth of Two major Smartphone Platforms
As the mobile market matures, smartphones from Apple and Google dominate the world-wide Operator markets. Today, according to Gartner and Statista, Android and iOS combine for more than 99.5% of new smartphone sales with 1.7 billion smartphone shipments forecasted in 2020. With Smartphones being the primary access point in the digital services landscape, this creates a growing need for Synchronoss platforms, products and solutions. The rest of the world is catching up not only to smart phones but in the services that accompany them. In sizable, emerging, low Average Revenue per User (“ARPU”) markets such as Latin America, Global System for Mobile Communications Association (“GSMA”) estimates that almost 85 million new smartphones are in use in the region since 2016, with Brazil adding more than 20 million and Mexico 18 million. By 2020, the region is expected to have an adoption rate of 71%, ahead of the global average of 66% with an additional 170 million new smartphone users expected to be across the region by the end of the decade.
Growth in Data
In 1992, the Internet was handling 100 GB of data per day and twenty-five years later, it is more than 25,000 GB per second, primarily thanks to the use of mobile channels. The growth in smartphones and high speed network proliferation begets aggressive growth in data consumption and usage. According to marketingland, the mobile segment now represents 65 percent of digital media time. We believe this growth will increase the adoption of Synchronoss’ services such as cloud and messaging on the consumer end and in the Digital and IoT markets. Global monthly mobile data traffic is forecasted to double every two years from 2016 to 2021. Video is expected to consume more than 80% of consumer Internet traffic in 2021 and from 2018-2021, video consumption is expected to more than double from 75 PB per month to 159 PB. 
User Generated Content
With the growth in data comes a commensurate growth in user generated content (“UGC”) which has a direct correlation on the adoption of cloud storage services. While subscribers still consume far more video than they produce, the amount of data produced is going up steadily. iCloud from Apple increased storage tiers, from 20GB to 50GB, and from 1TB to 2TB. Google Photos has more than 500 million users, with approximately 1.2 billion photos uploaded every day. While cloud storage has thrived on a primarily “freemium” model, the rate of storage hitting the consumer “pay wall” is on the rise. Business Insider estimates that eleven million subscribers, or 0.7% of the Dropbox base, now pay for cloud storage each month.
Data Security and Email Platforms
Service providers were at one point content to relinquish branded control of their email services to OTT providers (Yahoo, Google, etc.) but are now beginning to take a renewed interest in white label solutions due, in part to a recent history of security breaches from OTT providers. In the past five years (2013-2017), there were more than 40 data breaches that affected at least a million records each. The largest breaches were: Yahoo (1 billion), Friend Finder Networks (400 million), Adobe (152 million), eBay (145 million), Equifax (143 million), JP Morgan Chase (76 million), Target (70 million) and Sony (100 TB of data). According to Radacati, the worldwide market for Secure Email Gateway solutions continues to show growth and is forecasted to grow to over $1.9 billion by 2020.
Big Data and Monetization
The scale of data circulating over wireless and broadband networks has given rise to the monetization of big data causing many to proclaim it as “Data is the new oil.” International Data Corporation (“IDC”) forecasts the market for big data and business analytics will grow to $203 billion by 2020. Data is being used to gather intelligence on consumers and deliver more effective and predictive services. According to the Boston Consulting Group, the application of personal data could deliver a €1 trillion annual economic benefit (roughly 8% of current Gross Domestic Product) to the EU-27 by 2020. 
OTT IP Messaging
One of the most significant growth stories of the past two years has been the rise in Messaging applications and the Messaging as a Platform (“MaaP”) services that support them. This growth started in response to a free IP alternative to tariffed SMS followed 
14

by IP feature growth which created a huge surge in IP Messaging usage. According to TechCrunch, WhatsApp has 1.5 billion users and 60 billion messages sent per day and Facebook Messenger has 1.3 billion users. Together, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp alone out pace global SMS on a daily basis 3:1 (60 billion to 20 billion messages per day). Most of the growth in A2P messaging revenue has occurred in the APAC markets with sparks beginning to ignite in American and EMEA markets. Chinese messaging giant WeChat has one billion monthly active users. The LINE app generated more than $1.5 billion revenue in 2017 representing annual growth of approximately 19%. KakaoTalk generated more than $900 million revenue in 2017 or annual growth of approximately 14%. With the advent of automated chat bots from these messaging services, the pathway to future brand dialogue is being paved as the new norm. By 2020, it is expected that 85% of a customer’s brand experience will occur without any human interaction. 
Digital Transformation
Apple, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook are now five (“Big Five”) of the six biggest companies in the world and are all digital companies. Their ten year rise to the top of global companies is sending shockwaves throughout the TMT and IoT markets to catch up. These companies are trying to transform themselves digitally not only to escape growth and margin pressures (in the case of Telcos) but also in a race to meet consumer expectations largely set by the Big Five companies mentioned above. According to the Boston Consulting Group, the average US household receives annual benefit of $970 from digital services. As an example, by 2022, it is expected that there will be over 70 million households in the U.S. with at least one voice-enabled smart speaker. This is more than the 66.6 million non-satellite Pay TV subscribers (Cable TV and Telco TV subscribers combined). This sudden evolution has created a thriving market place for platform, product and solution vendors to give existing companies a leg up in the digital arms race. As a result, Digital Journal expects Digital Transformation spending to be $1.3 trillion in 2018. But spending is not enough as 84% of companies fail at digital transformation, according to Forbes. This is especially telling that companies who have budget to catch up to the Big Five companies in the world will need large amounts of assistance. Creating a digital-worthy customer experience is not an inherent skill in most companies. As a result, Markets and Markets projects that the customer experience management market is projected to grow from an estimated $6 billion in 2017 to $17 billion by 2022, at a cumulative average growth rate of approximately 23%.
Propagation of 5G Network and IoT
Perhaps the biggest growth driver of the next five years will be the advent of the 5G Network and the epoch change in business that comes with it. Network operators will trial 5G in 2018, with the goal of launching in 2020. 5G tops out at 10 gigabits per second (“Gbps”). That means 5G is a hundred times faster than the current 4G technology-at its theoretical maximum speed. Perhaps the real value in 5G isn’t the speed but the low latency. The 5G Network was designed around enabling use cases in the IoT marketplace and this network will set the IoT market on its way. Smart Cities will be a major driver and customer of the 5G networks. Gartner estimates that around 380 million connected things are in use in cities to deliver sustainability and climate change goals in 2017, and that this figure will increase to 1.39 billion units in 2020, representing 20 percent of all smart city connected things in use. The amount of data traffic will likely grow faster than the number of connections because of the increase of deployment of video applications on M2M connections and the increased use of applications, such as telemedicine and smart car navigation systems, which require greater bandwidth and lower latency. Moreover, more people are moving into urban environments where IoT and smart cities are growing. By 2050, there is expected to be 7.5 billion people living in urban environments, equivalent to the entire world population today. Simply put, cities will be forced to get more efficient causing a greater need for IoT device, ecosystem, network and administrative solutions. 
Growth Strategy
Our growth strategy is to establish our platforms as the de-facto industry standard for CSPs, MSOs, OEMs, multi-channel retailers and TMT enterprise customers while investing in logical extensions of our product and services portfolio into new markets. We will continue to focus our technology and development efforts around improving functionality, helping customers drive higher ARPU and subscriber retention, embracing alternative channels and allowing more capabilities for ordering bundled applications and content offerings across these same complex and advanced networks.
Key elements of our growth strategy are: 
Consolidation of focus. We expect our growth strategy to gain more traction as we narrow the focus of our offerings away from secure Enterprise and into “consumer” markets in the Operator, TMT and IoT sectors. This added focus will streamline and strengthen our product investments and reinforce our reputation as a consumer-oriented technologies company.
Expand growth in our core product lines. Along with our re-focus to our core offerings and market we will aggressively seek opportunities to expand our existing offerings to new customers and deepen our relationship with existing customers. 
15

Expansion of Synchronoss Personal Cloud. We will expand our Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform, products and solutions to new service provider (CSP, MSO) customers. This sales and marketing push will reinforce major trends at work in the market: the increase of cloud adoption from OTT providers and the proven effectiveness (and consumer willingness) to pay for premium cloud storage. These two trends shift the perceived value of an Operator cloud to a profit center vs a cost center that should open new sales opportunities with new customers and in new markets. Additionally, we are increasing our efforts to partner with analogous partners in the Personal Cloud space with companies who provide other handset services to Operators. An example of this partnering effort in handset insurance. The bundling of personal cloud with handset insurance creates a “total protection” bundle which creates a better business model for operators and a better value for customers. Finally, as new markets emerge for Synchronoss, such as IoT, we believe our Personal Cloud solution is positioned as a significant value add to new devices such as Connected/Autonomous automobiles, drones and sensors who will benefit from smart, secure data storage and exchange. 
Expansion of Digital. Our success in Digital services began with device and service activation through operators. With the advent of business and technology trends such as Digital Transformation, IoT, etc. our Digital line of products is poised for new growth due to the unique nature of the problems it solves for our customers at harnessing complex data and creating new experiences in the back office. 
Expansion of Activation. The foundation of our Activation solution is activating devices and services directly for service provider customers. As service providers invest in digital transformation of their operations and cost structures, Activation of devices and services is positioned to help transition service providers’ digital footprint and decrease their overall cost structure. This case study is being aggressively marketed and sold by us to new service providers globally on the heels of this trend. Additionally, we are pursuing indirect methods of distribution through OEM and other technology channels who seek to activate devices and service plans on behalf of several Operators in the market. We believe our Activation platform is positioned well to bring new devices, sensors, nodes and more online in the IoT market. Finally, Activation is uniquely positioned to harness data from bespoke, complex sources in Operators and TMT customers to create new digital use cases in everything from automated self-care, personalized sales & marketing and other lower cost, high value digital interfaces with subscribers and consumers. 
Expansion of Digital Channels. Our Digital Channels product provides a customized, predictive interface to purchasing devices and services from Operators and maintaining an effective, automated self-service environment. Digital Channels applies our Activation platform’s ability to sit over top of existing data silos as a “Logic Layer” and surgically extract data as needed to create a personalized account self-service portal for Operator’s B2B major accounts and consumer buy flows. As Operators expand their offerings and markets, the need to conflate different services into a single buy flow is imperative to making good use of their massive distribution channel. To that end, our Digital Channels product can provide an easy to use, powerful, personalized single interface, buy flow and self-service interface for a one-stop-shop and care interface online and on mobile applications. As an example, Digital Channels is being deployed by Sprint to combine their wireline, wireless and IoT product lines into a single B2B buy flow - saving them cost, decreasing time to market and unlocking new revenue. 
Expansion of Digital Broker. Digital Broker enables Operators to onboard and manage independent software vendors (“ISV”) as a distribution channel to their Enterprise and small business customers. Digital Broker sits as a module on top of our Digital Channels product and gives B2B customers a turn key way to procure and manage their relationship with ISV’s directly. We believe this provides new revenue and functionality for Operators to offer their B2B subscribers and will create a stronger interest in our Digital Channels product. 
Expansion of Messaging. As messaging grows in scale and potency to overtake social platforms in active users and ARPU, more companies are looking at messaging as not only a vital service for communications but for commerce. Our Email and Advanced Messaging platforms, products and solutions are well positioned to help Operators, TMT Enterprise and IoT participants harness this new trend.
Expansion of Advanced Messaging. As noted in the demand drivers for our business, advanced (IP and RCS) messaging continues to surge ahead of social media in audience engagement and ARPU. Operator messaging revenue has been the biggest victim of the OTT digital revolution. According to Juniper Research, the consumer migration from operator voice and text services to OTT messaging services and social media cost network operators nearly $104 billion in 2017, equivalent to 12% of their service revenues. WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WeChat have grown their revenues on the basis of forming open access communities that attract vast, captive, and engaged audiences that continue to glean new commercial opportunities. This multi-dimensional approach presents the future to mobile operators - for most, the response will be investments in RCS. Most have conceded that they are unlikely to return to the SMS glory days of old - RCS, despite ongoing issues related to its business case, seems to be the accepted, operator-wide response. There are however, a range of operators 
16

that aren’t content with RCS alone. Some operators are developing their own competitive OTT messaging offerings to try and claw back at least some of the revenue they’ve lost. Some operators are looking to join forces and build mobile-centric messaging communities that emulate OTT services, but have the potential to go even further. While they will likely not displace OTT messaging providers they are well positioned to obtain net/new revenue. We see opportunities for cooperation in markets as well as the use of MaaP to enhance carrier service and care offerings. 
Expansion of Email. The year 2017 saw a shift, in the Operator community, away from a less expensive OTT email solution to white label due, in part to the business and brand implications of massive security breaches with Yahoo and others. Our email platform remains competitive in terms of feature sets, ability to scale, carrier grade security and ability to monetize communications channels. To that end, we have been working to secure and renew existing Operator/Service provider contracts to grow our base of messaging operations worldwide. 
Geographic Market Expansion. Synchronoss is maintaining and growing its worldwide presence by reinforcing its leadership in the EMEA markets and solidifying its footholds in the APAC markets as well as re-entering the Latin America markets with Cloud platform offerings. 
Diversification & Expansion of our customer base in TMT. Synchronoss is consolidating its focus on the consumer markets and moving away from the Secure Enterprise Market position we held in 2017. To accentuate this focus in the consumer markets, we are widening our product scope beyond Operators to the entire TMT industry as well as the IoT markets as they invest in digital transformation initiatives. This will provide a wide range of applicability for Synchronoss platforms, products and solutions throughout worldwide markets. 
Expansion into Emerging Devices and Internet of Things Space. Various forecasts from industry leading sources have cited explosive growth in the non-traditional connected devices space. Such devices include connected cars, connected homes, health and wellness and health care domains and smart cities. We plan on expanding both our activation platforms (focused on the new activation needs emerging from such devices on the service provider networks) as well as our cloud (focused on storing data from the varying devices to be stored securely in the Cloud) and messaging platforms in an effort to capitalize on the growth emerging from these new opportunities.
Customers
Our industry-leading customers include Tier 1 mobile service providers such as AT&T Inc., Verizon Wireless, Vodafone, Orange, Sprint and Telstra, Tier 1 cable operators/MSOs and wireline operators like AT&T Inc., Comcast, Cablevision, Charter, CenturyLink, Mediacom and Level 3 Communications, and large OEMs such as Apple and Ericsson. These customers utilize our platforms, technology and services to service both consumer and business customers.
We maintain strong and collaborative relationships with our customers, which we believe to be one of our core competencies and critical to our success. We are generally the only provider of the services we offer to our customers. Contracts extend up to 60 months from execution and include minimum transaction or revenue commitments from our customers. All of our significant customers may terminate their contracts for convenience upon written notice and in many cases payment of contractual penalties. 
Our top five customers accounted for 73%, 74% and 82% of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Contracts with these customers typically run for three to five years. Of these customers, Verizon accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2017. The loss of Verizon as a customer would have a material negative impact on our company. However, we believe that Verizon would encounter substantial costs in replacing Synchronoss’ solution.
Sales, Partnerships and Marketing
Sales
We market and sell our services primarily through a direct sales force and through our strategic partners. To date, we have concentrated our sales efforts on a range of CSPs, OEMs, enterprises, government and multi-channel retailers both domestically and internationally. Typically, our sales process involves an initial consultative process that allows our customers to better assess the operating and capital expenditure benefits associated with an optimal activation, provisioning, and cloud-based content management architecture. Our sales teams are well trained in our Activation Services, Synchronoss Personal Cloud, Synchronoss Messaging and Synchronoss Digital Transformation platforms and on the market trends and conditions that our current and potential customers are facing. This enables them to easily identify and qualify opportunities that are appropriate for our platforms deployments to benefit these customers. Following each sale, we assign account managers to provide ongoing support and to 
17

identify additional sales opportunities. We generate leads from contacts made through trade-shows, seminars, conferences, events, market research, our Web site, customers, strategic partners and our ongoing public relations programs.
Partnerships
We are establishing a dedicated partner outreach as a dedicated arm of growth for Synchronoss. The Synchronoss Partnership program will have three dedicated vectors of focus:
