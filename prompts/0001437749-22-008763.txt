Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
Founded in 1979 as Information Analysis Incorporated, the Company changed its name to WaveDancer, Inc. and converted from a Virginia corporation to a Delaware corporation in December 2021. The Company is in the business of developing and maintaining information technology (“IT”) systems, modernizing client information systems, and performing other IT-related professional services to government and commercial organizations.
 
The Company is an IT provider primarily for the benefit of federal government agencies. At present, we primarily apply our technology, services and experience to legacy software migration and modernization, developing web-based and mobile device solutions, including dynamic electronic forms development and conversion, data analytics, and we are in the process of acquiring talent and expertise in developing cybersecurity and cloud services practices. Our focus is on enterprise IT solutions primarily relating to system modernization, cloud-based solutions and cybersecurity protection.
 
Since the Company’s inception, we have performed software development and conversion projects for over 100 commercial and government customers including, but not limited to, the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Department of Education, Department of Homeland Security, Department of the Treasury, U.S. Small Business Administration, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, Department of Veterans Affairs, and General Dynamics Information Technology (formerly Computer Sciences Corporation, CSRA).
 
Modernization has been a core competency of the Company for over 20 years. We have modernized over 100 million lines of COBOL code for over 35 governmental and commercial customers. We maintain a pool of skilled COBOL programmers. This provides us with competitive advantage as the labor pool of such programmers is shrinking as aging software professionals retire. Our business has also historically relied upon the reselling of applications, primarily for forms development.
 
Through our acquisition in April 2021 of Tellenger, Inc. (“Tellenger”), which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, we acquired competencies in web-based solutions and cybersecurity. Tellenger is a boutique IT consulting and software development firm specializing in modernization, software development, cybersecurity, cloud solutions, and data analytics. We believe combining web-based solutions with system modernization will provide us with the skill sets that are needed to migrate legacy systems to the cloud. We foresee this as a key component of our modernization growth since there are billions of lines of code, in both the governmental and commercial sectors, that eventually must be modernized. It is also our intention to better leverage our resources, largely gained through the acquisition of Tellenger, to take advantage of the growth in the cybersecurity market.
 
In December 2021, we announced the reorganization of our entire professional services practice into Tellenger, and as a result, our professional services are contained in a single entity. Through Tellenger, we perform services such as business process re-engineering, cloud migrations, and Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) implementations on behalf of clients in the private and public sector with an aim to increase productivity, gain efficiencies, and achieve key performance indicators. Tellenger is appraised at Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3.
 
Through our acquisition of Gray Matters, Inc. and in connection with our business transformation strategy which we discuss below, in December 2021 we gained access to blockchain and encryption algorithm technology. Gray Matters specializes in the supply chain management (“SCM”) industry and in United States intelligence, national security and diplomatic organizations. Gray Matters uses a “Zero Trust” product and is designed to secure and monitor the lifecycle of manufacturing through destruction and recycling.

Our Strategy
 
Our strategy is to grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions.
 
Through the acquisitions of Tellenger and Gray Matters in 2021, we began to reposition our legacy professional services business by allocating resources away from third-party product reselling and toward professional services, which management viewed as higher margin, including within the SCM sector. In assessing the Company’s repositioning, management observed cybersecurity practices as evolving toward a zero trust approach, the integration of blockchain as enhancing SCM, and the proliferation of Internet of Things (“IoT”) devices that were taking organizational networks to the edge. With respect to its focus on IoT, the Company agreed to acquire Knowmadics, Inc. (“Knowmadics”) on March 18, 2022. The acquisition remains subject to stockholder approval of share issuances contemplated under the definitive purchase agreement and our obtaining financing to fund the purchase price under the agreement. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Pending Acquisition of Knowmadics” for more information on the Knowmadics acquisition. Additionally, we have been seeking to purchase other technology companies whose businesses complement the Company’s existing business and whose personnel would better enable us to compete for engagements in our focus areas.
 
To grow organically, we have hired and plan to continue to hire, business development personnel and intend to become more proactive in bidding as a prime contractor on government proposals and in expanding our outreach to larger prime contractors for subcontract and teaming opportunities.
 
In November 2021, we upgraded our listing from the OTCQB to the Nasdaq Capital Market.
 
Products and Services
 
While we offer a range of services, historically, two areas of focus for us have been modernization, including cloud services and migrations, and cybersecurity. With our acquisition of Gray Matters, we are expanding our business by adding blockchain-enabled supply chain management capabilities. Each of these areas are more fully described below.
Modernization
 
Tellenger’s modernization focus spans legacy system modernizations as well as cloud assessment and migration efforts. Through our services, we aim to address client requirements, determine the best plan of action, and execute on that plan. We have provided modernization solutions to more than 40 government and private sector clients, with a particular focus on modernizing older, proprietary mainframe COBOL applications. 
 
Tellenger helps organizations understand their current level of cloud maturity and plan for their next phase of cloud adoption, be it a full cloud or hybrid solution, or a private or public cloud, and aims to address security concerns in the process. We offer consulting and engineering services that range from cloud adoption to application migrations to cloud optimization. Our customer engagements utilize Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Red Hat.
 
Cybersecurity
 
Tellenger specializes in cybersecurity by leveraging its resources within software development and cloud services, and took part in designing, developing, and deploying a large cybersecurity initiative for the DHS CDM program, which enabled the agency to continuously manage its cybersecurity posture through a dynamic approach to fortifying their networks and systems. We have also helped design, develop, and implement a multi-tenant cybersecurity-managed service for government agencies known as Dashboard-as-a-Service (DBaaS).
Our Zero-Trust Blockchain-Enabled Supply Chain Platform 
 
Our suite of zero-trust blockchain-enabled products, acquired with our purchase of Gray Matters, are currently deployed in support of certain requirements of the U.S. government and serves to operationalize their SCM. We have several installations of our blockchain technology presently fielded to audit, track and monitor our customer's mission-enabling equipment and assets. To meet our customer's security and confidentiality requirements, we offer our solutions as standalone systems to precisely audit and track our customer's equipment by providing real-time monitoring of material. We offer a standard user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to our customer but have and will continue to offer customized solutions in the defense and intelligence sectors.

Professional Services 
 
The majority of our revenue is derived from services that we provide our U.S. government customers through our subsidiary, Tellenger. Tellenger offers a suite of IT services including consulting, development, training, migration and modernization implementation, and on-site project support. Tellenger’s current contracts extend into 2023 and 2024. 
Overview of Market
 
Blockchain
 
Blockchain is an emerging technology that has the potential to provide significant efficiency and security gains in businesses.  As the global economy becomes increasingly digital, we believe that blockchain-enabled business models will fundamentally alter how business is conducted in the future. Blockchain is most relevant to establish trust between two or more people organization where trust would not otherwise exist.  This inter-party trust is built on blockchain’s robust security, the increased transparency of transactions within a blockchain, and instant traceability of digital assets. In addition to increasing trust, the promise of blockchain lies in cost savings, increased transaction speeds and significant advances in automation.  We believe there will be significant demand for permissioned blockchains within our markets when savings and efficiencies are quantified.
 
Our suite of zero-trust blockchain enabled products are currently deployed in support of certain requirements of the U.S. government. We have several installations of our blockchain technology presently fielded to audit, track and monitor our customer’s mission-enabling equipment and assets. See “—Products and Services—Our Zero-Trust Blockchain-Enabled Supply Chain Platform” for more information on our blockchain services.
 
Cloud Solutions Marketplace
 
The cybersecurity and cloud solutions markets continue to be among the fastest growing segments of the information technology professional services business, as small and large companies and state and federal government agencies are expanding their presence and reach through cloud implementations. Complex web applications generally require knowledge of customers’ back-end systems based on mainframe or mid-level computers. We believe that we are one of few small companies that have the expertise to develop these more sophisticated web applications, both internally and through strategic business relationships with software firms.
Information Collection and Dissemination
 
Given executive level directives to improve outreach to stakeholders, federal and state government agencies are now empowered to find means of facilitating dissemination of information quickly and efficiently. Government requirements are unique in that most government processes are based on forms. Many government agencies rely on thousands of internal and external forms to conduct their business. Forms usage within the federal government is also subject to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and its related accessibility requirements for information and communications technology. Of particular concern are PDF documents, which need special remediation due to generally being inaccessible from mobile devices. PDFs are the predominant format for forms in the federal government, and we support several agencies in Section 508 PDF remediation through our solutions partnership with Adobe Systems.
 
The U.S. federal government has been employing more form data entry and citizen communication using mobile devices such as iPhones, iPads, and mobile devices employing the Android and other operating systems. Working with Adobe’s latest versions of Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”), we have been able to build applications for several federal clients employing mobile devices, as well as converting paper-based forms into “dynamic” or “adaptive” forms.

Legacy Migration and Modernization
 
The migration and modernization market is complex and diverse. Many large legacy systems remain in use because of the enormous cost to re-engineer these systems. Typically, these legacy systems have been patched and modified without adequate documentation for decades and utilize multiple reporting applications and methods used to recall the information contained within the systems. Currently, the options available to modernize these systems are many and include introduction of new hardware systems, employing advanced software languages, and utilization of the Internet or Intranets to achieve desired efficiencies. All of these options are often very expensive and time consuming because they require starting all over in defining requirements, designing structures, programming, and testing.
 
Opportunities for our modernization expertise continue to exist as government agencies and private companies are being driven to modernize for various reasons. One major reason is the increasing difficulty of finding and retaining staff with technical skills in outdated but in-use programming languages. Many senior programmers who possess these skills are nearing retirement. Another driving factor is the increased funding by federal and state legislatures to address the upgrading of their legacy systems. Hardware platforms such as Unisys are reaching the horizon of their usefulness, and consequently, older programming and database languages are generally poorly supported by their providers. Maintenance costs are materially increasing as vendors squeeze the most out of clients before the life-cycles of hardware and software expire. The inherent stability of these legacy systems and the costs of modernizing them through traditional methods have been barriers to decision-makers executing on the modernizations, but the increases in resources needed and the decrease in resources available to support these legacy systems will continue to force the issue. In addition, the Internet has added a new level of pressure to compete in the electronic marketplace with sector rivals. Over the next decade, we expect organizations to be under increasing pressure revamp their older legacy systems.
 
A segment of mainframe users is interested in simply updating their legacy systems without drastic rewritings to these systems in newer languages or adapting expensive enterprise products (such as SAP or Oracle) to their needs. These potential customers are looking for automated tools that can quickly and cost-effectively move applications onto cheaper computer platforms without the risk of failure. The Company, in conjunction with strategic partners, such as Micro Focus and Software Mining, offers its own conversion tool set and those of our partners in addressing this need and positioning us to uniquely deliver successful results. It is difficult to determine the exact size of this segment, but even a minor share of this market would represent significant prospective customers with meaningful opportunities.
 
The Company was a major partner in the successful modernization effort of the Small Business Administration ("SBA") 504 loan program through 2017 and 2018, and we are currently working with those same partners on another modernization effort at the SBA.
 
Competition
 
There are hundreds of firms performing traditional information technology services, business intelligence and cybersecurity, and general consulting for the federal government. A great number of them are much larger than we are, and are more established in the marketplace, and have more resources to pursue individual prospects.
 
The competition in the conversion and modernization market is very strong. Many software professional services companies have had some involvement in this area and profess proficiency in performing these projects. We also face competition from other companies that purport to substantially automate the process through software tools including Blue Phoenix Solutions, Fujitsu, and IBM. Software for enterprise resource planning, such as SAP and Oracle, provides an additional source of competition, although to date, the cost and lengthy installation time for enterprise resource planning software has slowed its implementation in the marketplace. No matter what type of solution is offered, many of our competitors have greater name recognition than our company, a larger, more established customer base, and significantly greater financial and market resources.

In the realm of enterprise-based web content management systems, there are a number of small and large companies offering such software products and related consulting services. We believe that the Adobe Experience Manager, or AEM, product suite will continue to excel against such competition, including offerings such as Microsoft’s SharePoint solution. AEM has performed well in the federal marketplace due to its full offering of powerful capabilities such as cloud integration and intuitive customization. AEM is a solution that optimizes the authoring, management and delivery of digital media and content across owned channels, including web, mobile, email, print and social communities. From 2019 to 2020, Gartner named Adobe as a leader in multiple categories of its Magic Quadrant reporting including, but not limited to, digital experience platforms, personalization engines, CRM lead management, ad tech, digital commerce, and multichannel marketing hubs. 
 
Government Regulation
 
We are bound by various rules and regulations promulgated by the federal government and agencies thereunder. We have not experienced undue expense beyond those expenses normally incurred in our ordinary course of business in adhering to such rules and regulations. Since historically most of our business is derived from contracts either directly with the U.S. federal government or as a subcontractor on behalf of U.S. federal government customers, most of our contracts are subject to termination at the election of the government. 
 
Given our current strategy to reposition the business within the SCM sector, President Biden’s Executive Order on America’s Supply Chains, issued on February 24, 2021, may have a direct impact on our business going forward. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Government Regulation” for more information.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We depend upon a combination of trade secret and copyright laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our methodologies, databases and software. We have not filed any patent applications covering our methodologies and software. In addition, we attempt to protect the secrecy of our proprietary databases and other trade secrets and proprietary information through agreements with employees and consultants.
 
We also seek to protect the source code of our proprietary ICONS legacy code conversion tools suite as trade secrets. The copyright protection accorded to databases, however, is fairly limited. While the arrangement and selection of data can be protected, the actual data is not, and others are free to create software performing the same function. We believe, however, that the creation of competing databases would be very time consuming and costly. 
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed fifty-one full-time and four part-time individuals. All of our billable professionals have at least four years of related experience. For computer related services, we believe that the diverse professional opportunities and interaction among our employees contribute to maintaining a stable professional staff with limited turnover.
 
We have no collective bargaining agreements or other such labor contracts with our employees and believe that our employee relationships are satisfactory. In the long-term, management will likely hire additional staff to meet its anticipated growth requirements. We do not anticipate encountering material problems in our ability to hire individuals with the requisite employee skill sets, despite a competitive market for our requisite technical skill sets and government clearances, when required. We utilize fee-based recruiting firms when it is necessary to speed up the process of locating and hiring employees with specialized skill sets and clearances.
