ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Except as expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company,” “Avis Budget,” “we,” “our” or “us” means Avis Budget Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. “Avis,” “Budget,” “Budget Truck,” “Zipcar,” “Payless,” “Apex,” “Maggiore” and “FranceCars” refer to our Avis Rent A Car System, LLC, Budget Rent A Car System, Inc., Budget Truck Rental, LLC, Zipcar, Inc., Payless Car Rental, Inc., Apex Car Rentals, Maggiore Rent S.p.A. and AAA France Cars SAS operations, respectively, and, unless the context otherwise requires, do not include the operations of our licensees, as further discussed below.

OVERVIEW

We are a leading global provider of vehicle rental and other mobility solutions, through our three most recognized brands Avis, Budget and Zipcar together with several brands well recognized in their respective markets, including Payless in the U.S. and certain other regions, Maggiore in Italy, FranceCars in France and Apex in both Australia and New Zealand. We and our licensees operate the Avis and Budget brands in approximately 180 countries throughout the world. We generally maintain a leading share of airport car rental revenue in North America, Europe and Australasia, and we operate one of the leading truck rental businesses in the U.S.
Our brands are differentiated to help us meet a wide range of customer mobility needs throughout the world. Avis is a leading rental vehicle brand positioned to serve the premium commercial and leisure segments of the travel industry, and Budget is a leading rental vehicle brand focused primarily on more value-conscious segments of the industry. Our Zipcar brand is the world’s leading car sharing business offering an alternative to traditional vehicle rental and ownership. 
On average, our rental fleet totaled more than 620,000 vehicles and we completed more than 39 million vehicle rental transactions worldwide in 2017. We generate approximately 70% of our time and mileage (“T&M”) revenue from on-airport locations and approximately 30% of our T&M revenue from off-airport locations. We also license the use of the Avis, Budget and Zipcar trademarks to licensees in areas in which we do not operate directly. Our brands have an extended global reach with more than 11,000 car and truck rental locations throughout the world, including approximately 4,750 car rental locations operated by our licensees. We believe that Avis, Budget and Zipcar enjoy complementary demand patterns with mid-week commercial demand balanced by weekend leisure demand.
We operate Budget Truck, one of the leading truck rental businesses in the U.S., through a network of approximately 925 dealer-operated and 450 Company-operated locations throughout the continental U.S. We also own Payless, a car rental brand that operates in the deep-value segment of the industry in the U.S. and other regions; Apex, which is a leading deep-value car rental brand in New Zealand and Australia; Maggiore, a leading vehicle rental brand in Italy; and FranceCars, which operates one of the largest light commercial vehicle fleets in France. We also have investments in certain of our Avis and Budget licensees outside of the U.S., including joint ventures in India and China.

COMPANY HISTORY

Founded in 1946, Avis is believed to be the first company to rent cars from airport locations. Avis expanded its geographic reach throughout the U.S. through growth in licensed and Company-operated locations in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1963, Avis introduced its award winning “We try harder®” advertising campaign, which was recognized as one of the top ten advertising campaigns of the 20th century by Advertising Age magazine.
HFS Incorporated acquired Avis in 1996 and merged with our predecessor company in 1997, with the combined entity being renamed Cendant Corporation. The Company is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey.
In 2002, Cendant acquired the Budget brand and Budget vehicle rental operations in North America, Australia and New Zealand. Budget was founded in 1958 as a car rental company for the value-conscious vehicle rental

customer and grew its business rapidly during the 1960s, expanding its rental car offerings throughout North America and significantly expanding its Budget truck rental business in the 1990s.
In 2006, Cendant completed the sales and spin-offs of several significant subsidiaries and changed its name to Avis Budget Group, Inc. In 2011, we expanded our international operations with the acquisition of Avis Europe, which was previously an independently-owned licensee operating the Avis and Budget brands in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the Avis brand in Asia. Upon the completion of the acquisition of Avis Europe, the Avis and Budget brands were globally reunited under a single company, making Avis Budget Group one of the largest vehicle rental companies in the world.
In 2013, we acquired Zipcar, the world’s leading car sharing network, to further increase our growth potential and our ability to better serve a greater variety of our customers’ mobility needs. In 2012 and 2013, we acquired our Apex and Payless brands, respectively, which allowed us to expand our presence in the deep-value segment of the car rental industry. In 2015, we acquired Maggiore, a leading provider of vehicle rental services in Italy. In 2016, we acquired FranceCars, a privately held vehicle rental company based in France, and significantly expanded our presence in the French market. In 2017, we acquired the operation of our Budget licensee in Poland complementing the acquisition of our Avis Poland licensee in 2015. These acquisitions have allowed us to further expand our global footprint of Company-operated locations and brand presence.
As a Company, we have a long history of innovation in our industry, including:

• | in 1973, we launched our proprietary Wizard system, a constantly updated information-technology system that is the backbone of our operations;


• | in 1987, we introduced our Roving Rapid Return program, powered by a handheld computer device that allows customers to bypass the car return counter;


• | in 1996, we became one of the first car rental companies to accept online reservations;


• | in 2000, we introduced Avis Interactive, the first Internet-based reporting system in the car rental industry;


• | in 2009, we launched what we believe to be the first car rental iPhone application in the U.S.;


• | in 2012, we believe that our Avis brand became the first in the industry to offer mobile applications to customers on all major mobile platforms;


• | in 2013, we acquired Zipcar, a constantly innovating pioneer in using advanced vehicle technologies as the first car sharing company in the U.S. to develop a self-service solution which allows the management of the complex interactions of real-time, location-based activities inherent in a large-scale car sharing operation, including new member application, reservations and keyless vehicle access, fleet management and member management;


• | in 2015, our Avis brand was the first in the industry to offer an Android application that allows customers to use voice-activated technology to make, confirm or cancel their car rental reservations and the first U.S. car rental company to offer an application for the Apple Watch, which enables our customers to email themselves a car rental receipt and view current, upcoming and past car rental reservations from their device;


• | since 2015, we have continued to expand our use of yield management systems, which the Company designed to help optimize its decision-making with respect to pricing and fleet management;


• | in 2016, we significantly upgraded the Avis mobile application, which provides our Avis customers with greater control of their rental experience and enabled several mobile features new to the industry, including an ability for customers to open and close rentals, exchange vehicles and extend rentals on their smartphone or tablet device.

In 2017, our pace of innovation and advancement accelerated significantly with the announcement of several key initiatives that we believe will further support our position as a leader in mobility, including:

• | the launch of our first-ever Mobility Lab located in the Kansas City, Missouri area, which utilizes connected car technology to deliver both customer benefits and operational efficiencies;


• | our plan to double the number of connected vehicles in our U.S. Avis fleet to more than 100,000 cars by the end of 2018, as the next step toward our goal of having a 100% global connected fleet by the end of 2020;


• | our partnership with Waymo, the Alphabet-owned global provider of autonomous vehicle technology, to provide fleet management services and solutions for their current and future markets, providing a unique opportunity to manage and operate self-driving vehicles for both our business and for current and future partners’ fleets and services;


• | our integration with Amazon Alexa, which allows our customers the ability to book and manage their car rental reservations through the popular voice platform on Amazon Echo devices;


• | our use of artificial intelligence to enhance our customers’ rental experiences through the launch of a Google Assistant action to book their reservations using voice-controlled access through Google Home;


• | our partnership with RocketSpace, a leading technology accelerator for start-ups and corporate innovators, in which we are working with a number of diverse global businesses across the mobility landscape to identify market opportunities and encourage cross-industry innovation;


• | our launch of a new mobility option for Zipcar members who depend on a vehicle during the week to commute to and from work, which provides members unlimited, sole access to a vehicle and a dedicated parking spot; and


• | our introduction of Zipcar one-way rentals through our new “Flex” product in London.


SEGMENT INFORMATION

We categorize our operations into two reportable business segments: 

• | Americas, which provides and licenses the Company’s brands to third parties for vehicle rentals and ancillary products and services in North America, South America, Central America and the Caribbean, and operates the Company’s car sharing business in certain of these markets; and

OUR STRATEGY

Our objective is to drive sustainable, profitable growth for our Company by delivering strategic initiatives aimed at winning customers through differentiated brands and products, increasing our margins via revenue growth and operational efficiency and enhancing our leadership in the evolving mobility landscape.
Supporting and Strengthening Our Brands
In executing our strategy, we will continue to position our distinct and well-recognized global brands to focus on different segments of customer demand, complemented by our other brands in their respective regional markets. With Avis as a premium brand preferred more by corporate and upscale leisure travelers, Budget as a mid-tier brand targeting value-conscious travelers, Payless as a deep-value brand, Maggiore, FranceCars and Apex as well-recognized regional brands and Zipcar offering its members an urban alternative to car ownership, we believe we are able to satisfy a broad range of mobility demands. While our brands address different use-cases and target customers, we achieve efficiencies by sharing the same operational and administrative infrastructure while providing differentiated value propositions tailored to the brand.
While we currently operate our brands, either directly or through independent operators and licensees, in approximately 180 countries around the world, we will continue to strengthen and further expand our global footprint through organic growth and, potentially, through acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing agreements or other relationships:

• | In countries where we have Company-operated locations, we will continue to identify opportunities to add new rental locations, to grant licenses to independent third parties for areas where we do not currently operate and/or do not wish to operate directly, to strengthen the presence of our brands and to re-acquire previously granted license rights in certain cases.

6


◦ | In countries operated by licensees or partners, including our joint ventures in India and China, we will seek to ensure that our licensees are well positioned to realize the growth potential of our brands in those countries and are growing their presence in those markets, and we expect to consider the re-acquisition of previously granted license rights in certain cases.


◦ | In countries where we have either Company-operated or licensee-operated locations, we will continue to identify opportunities to leverage our Zipcar brand and its car sharing model, which allows us to fulfill the expanding urban mobility needs of customers.

Since our Avis brand represents approximately 58% of our revenue and is recognized as a global leader in vehicle rental, we are particularly focused on maintaining and building its reputation as a reliably high-quality service provider. Our Avis Preferred loyalty program, which offers our customers the ability to bypass the rental counter and also earn reward points, coupled with our continued investment in technology, including the Avis mobile application and new Avis websites, is a key part of our efforts to enhance the Avis experience for our customers.
We aim to provide a range of vehicles, products and services at competitive prices, to leverage various marketing channels and to maintain marketing affiliations and corporate account contracts that complement each brand’s positioning. We continue to invest in our brands through a variety of efforts, including both on-line and off-line marketing. We see particular growth opportunities for our Budget and other local brands in Europe, as the share of airport car rentals for Budget is significantly smaller in Europe than in certain other parts of the world, and for Zipcar internationally, where the brand’s proven car sharing model can be expanded into numerous geographic markets.
To further support and strengthen our brands, we are focused and committed to serving our customers and enhancing their rental experience, including through our Customer Led, Service Driven™ initiative, which aims to optimize our customers’ rental experience with our brands, our systems and our employees. We frequently solicit feedback from and survey our customers to better understand their needs and we have implemented actions that further enhance the services we provide our customers, including the following:

• | We created our Avis mobile application with significant input from our customers to provide a higher quality end-to-end user experience, building upon direct feedback to re-design the rental experience to meet customers’ needs. In conjunction with our connected-car fleet, our Avis mobile application provides customers a new and innovative way to control many elements of their rental experience via their smartphone or tablet device without the need to visit the rental counter. Through the Avis mobile application, our customers are able to view which cars are available in real-time; exchange or upgrade a car when near or on the rental lot; confirm, cancel or extend a rental; add ancillary products; return a car without assistance; view their rental agreement; confirm their fuel level at beginning and end of rental as well as miles driven; obtain assistance on demand; and seamlessly return and check-in their vehicle at the end of their journey.


• | We continue to upgrade our technology and the ways that can further serve our customers, to make the reservation, pick-up and return process more convenient and user-friendly, with a particular emphasis on enabling and simplifying our customers’ online interactions with us. We have partnered with other technology and product companies to continuously improve the user experience that serves our customers’ needs through various mobile and technology capabilities. These include applications that allow for voice-controlled access to our services through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant enabled devices.

We expect to continue to invest in these efforts, with a particular emphasis on technologies, services and products that we believe will allow us to serve customers more effectively and efficiently.
Margins and Operational Efficiency
In executing our strategy, we are focused on identifying and implementing actions that will increase our margins over the next several years. We see significant potential in the areas of optimizing our pricing and customer mix, increasing sales of ancillary products and services through new product developments; optimizing our procurement, deployment and disposition of vehicles, including increased use of non-auction channels for selling 
7

our cars; continuing to drive operational efficiency in our business; and applying connected-car/in-vehicle systems and other emerging mobility technologies in our operations.
We have pursued and will continue to pursue opportunities intended to drive our margins and increase our revenues and profitability, including:

• | Informing and offering our customers useful ancillary products and services; promoting car class upgrades, adjusting our mix of vehicles to match customer demand, restructuring our sales strategy to focus on the most profitable segments, increasing the number of rentals that customers book directly through our websites and mobile applications and increasing the proportion of transactions in which customers prepay for rental.


• | Investing in yield management and pricing analytics tools to increase the margins we earn per rental day. We have implemented, and plan to continue deploying, new technology systems that strengthen our yield management decisions and enable us to tailor our product, service and price offerings to meet our customers’ needs and react quickly to shifting market conditions. We will continue to adjust our pricing to improve profitability and manage our fleet to match changes in demand.


• | Aggressively managing and improving our fleet to better drive the purchase, deployment, and disposition of our fleet, grow our direct-to-dealer and consumer sales performance, reduce maintenance and repair expenses, better optimize our salvage costs, and reduce the risk of damage to our vehicles, which we believe will create significant financial benefits.


• | Continue seeking opportunities where our investments will generate strong returns, including by expanding our current rental locations, acquiring and integrating existing licensees in key markets, participating in joint ventures and acquiring leading brands in markets that will contribute to our profitability.


• | Leveraging Zipcar to increase our membership base within its existing markets, as well as expanding the brand into new markets where our existing car rental presence will help enable the introduction of Zipcar’s car sharing services.


• | Addressing demand in the deep-value segment of the vehicle rental industry with both our Payless and Apex brands and looking to increase the contribution from this growth segment of the market.

We continued to focus our efforts on rigorously controlling our costs, aggressively reducing expenses and increasing efficiencies throughout our organization by:

• | Continuing to implement process improvements impacting virtually all areas of our business to increase efficiencies, reduce operating costs and create sustainable cost savings using LEAN, Six Sigma and other similar tools.


• | Achieving reductions in underlying direct operating and selling, general and administrative expenses, including significant reductions in staff.


• | Taking significant actions to further streamline our main administrative offices and shared-services infrastructure through a restructuring program.


• | Assessing location, segment and customer profitability to address less-profitable aspects of our business and focus on the more-profitable accounts that will help drive increased revenue.


• | Deploying changes to our sales, marketing and affinity programs to improve profitability.


• | Implementing initiatives to integrate our acquired businesses, to realize cost efficiencies from combined maintenance, systems, technology and administrative infrastructure.


• | Seeking to better optimize our acquisition, deployment and disposition of fleet to lower costs and better meet customer demand, as well as continued fleet utilization benefits and savings by combining our car rental and car sharing fleets at times to reduce the number of unutilized vehicles.


• | Continuing to implement innovative technological solutions, including self-service voice reservation technology, mobile communications with customers and fleet optimization technologies to reduce costs.

We believe such operational improvements will continue to assist our financial performance.

Our Evolving Mobility Platform
Our Company is well-positioned to remain a global leader in the evolving mobility marketplace. We are focused on seizing opportunities that will allow us to increase our overall value through strategies that support our vehicle rental and other mobility solutions in driving improved profitability through our brands, broadening our partnerships and participation with other innovators and finding opportunities to provide new services and offerings for new and evolving mobility market segments. The mobility landscape has significantly expanded over the past few years, with an increasing number of companies launching their own mobility initiatives in support of fleet and supply chain management, electric and autonomous vehicles, financial and insurance services, digital commerce support and integrated transportation services. We have been and will continue to be actively engaged in partnerships that will help us develop and support mobility solutions for our current business models, and also allow us to test and launch new business models that may allow us to further expand our service offerings.
As the mobility landscape continues to evolve, we are strategically positioned to grow our business and engage in partnerships in the following areas:

• | Traditional vehicle rental and car sharing services;


• | Autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles and connected-car technologies that support our vehicle rental and car-sharing operations;


• | New mobility providers and consumer service platforms;


• | Partnerships with other transportation providers;


• | Ancillary products and services for our customers;


• | Digital commerce services, including data collection and other telematics; and


• | Fleet management and supply chain services.

We believe that new technologies and evolving customer preferences that favor the rental or sharing of, or other new approaches to using vehicles rather than traditional car ownership represent important opportunities for us to meet new and growing consumer and commercial mobility demand by leveraging our existing assets and expertise. We intend to expand our Zipcar brand into new markets and provide new mobility solutions, such as multi-modal trips to both help shape and satisfy our customers’ needs. In addition, we believe there are substantial opportunities for our Avis and Budget brands to benefit and grow as mobility solutions and vehicle-related technologies evolve. We have taken significant steps to enhance our Avis brand offering with our continued investment in the Avis mobile application and see opportunities to drive increased profitability as additional products and services are utilized by more of our customers.
In 2017, we undertook several initiatives and entered into partnerships in support of our strategy, including:

• | Our launch of our first-ever Mobility Lab in the Kansas City, Missouri area, utilizing fully connected vehicles that allows the Company to leverage its capabilities to deliver operational efficiencies through real-time inventory counts, mileage management and automated maintenance notifications that enhance and optimize the Company’s fleet management capabilities;


• | Our integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, which allows travelers to book and manage their car rental reservations through the popular voice platforms on Amazon Echo and Google Home devices;


• | Our partnership with Waymo, an Alphabet Inc. company, through which we are offering fleet support and maintenance services for their growing fleet of autonomous vehicles beginning with the initial market of Phoenix, Arizona;


• | Our focus on emerging technologies through our collaboration with RocketSpace, a leading technology accelerator for promising start-ups and corporate innovators, to help us identify market opportunities and fuel cross-industry innovation in areas such as autonomous vehicles, electronic vehicles, data analytics and artificial intelligence, next-generation fleet management, automated driver assisted systems and connected car solutions; and


• | Our support to the ride-hailing market as we seek to partner with both ride-hailing companies and auto manufacturers to provide fleet and fleet management and maintenance services that allow us to identify new markets and profitability opportunities.

We are committed to finding new and innovative ways to leverage our global presence and capabilities for leadership in the evolving mobility market. Our brands, customer relationships, locations, assets and infrastructure are all important strategic advantages that we believe enhance and will enable us to grow our position in the industry.

OUR BRANDS AND OPERATIONS

OUR BRANDS
Our Avis, Budget and Zipcar brands are three of the most recognized brands in our industry. We believe that we enjoy significant benefits from operating our Avis and Budget brands to target different customers but sharing the same maintenance facilities, fleet management systems, technology and administrative infrastructure. In addition, we are able to recognize significant benefits and savings by combining our car rental and car sharing maintenance activities and fleets at times to reduce the number of unutilized cars and to meet demand peaks. We believe that Avis, Budget and Zipcar all enjoy complementary demand patterns with mid-week commercial demand balanced by weekend leisure demand. We also operate the Apex and Payless brands, which operate in the deep-value segment of the car rental industry, and augment our Avis, Budget and Zipcar brands. We also operate the Maggiore brand in Italy and the FranceCars brand in France, which further extends the range of vehicle use occasions we are able to serve. 
Avis
The Avis brand provides high-quality vehicle rental and other mobility solutions at price points generally above non-branded and value-branded vehicle rental companies to serve the premium commercial and leisure segments of the travel industry. We operate or license the Avis vehicle rental system (the “Avis System”), one of the largest global vehicle rental systems, comprised of approximately 5,450 locations worldwide, including in virtually all of the largest commercial airports and cities in the world.
The Avis System is comprised of an approximately equal number of company-owned and licensee vehicle rental locations worldwide, in both the on-airport and off-airport, or local, rental markets. The table below presents the approximate number of locations that comprise the Avis System as of December 31, 2017.

 | Avis System Locations

Company-operated locations | 1,525 | | 1,150 | | 2,675
Licensee locations | 725 | | 2,050 | | 2,775
Total Avis System Locations | 2,250 | | 3,200 | | 5,450

In 2017, our company-operated Avis locations generated total world-wide revenue of approximately $5.2 billion, 62% of which was derived in the Americas. In 2017, approximately $1.8 billion (or 49%) of our Avis T&M revenue was derived from commercial customers and approximately $2.5 billion (or 70%) was derived from customers renting at airports. The following graphs present the approximate composition of our Avis revenue by segment and our Avis T&M revenue by customer and market in 2017.
10

We also license the Avis System to independent commercial owners who operate approximately half of our locations worldwide and generally pay royalty fees to us based on a percentage of applicable revenue. In 2017, approximately 30% of the global Avis System revenue was generated by our licensees. The graphs below present the approximate composition of the Avis System revenue in 2017.
We offer Avis customers a variety of premium services, including:

• | the Avis mobile application, which allows customers to reserve, confirm, choose or upgrade their vehicle, add ancillary products, open, close or extend rentals, and, in the case of certain connected vehicles, lock and unlock the vehicle, using their smartphone or tablet device while by-passing the rental counter. The application also allows customers to track courtesy buses to rental locations and help “find my car”;


• | Avis Preferred, a frequent renter rewards program that offers counter bypass at major airport locations and reward points for every dollar spent on vehicle rentals and related products;


• | the Avis Select Series, a selection of luxury vehicles including BMWs, Corvettes, Mercedes, Jaguars and others;

• | amenities such as Avis Access, a full range of special products and services for drivers and passengers with disabilities;


• | Avis Interactive, a proprietary management tool that allows corporate clients to easily view and analyze their rental activity via the Internet, permitting these clients to better manage their travel budgets and monitor employee compliance with applicable travel policies; and


• | Connected car technology that will involve nearly 100,000 vehicles by late 2018 that provide our customers with increased mobility solutions as they seek more control and convenience over their rental experience.

11


• | Applications that serve our customers through various mobile and technology platforms, including Apple Watch devices, voice-controlled access through Amazon Alexa enabled devices, and Google Assistant enabled devices.

Budget
The Budget brand is a leading supplier of vehicle rental and other mobility solutions focused primarily on more value-conscious segments of the industry. We operate or license the Budget vehicle rental system (the “Budget System”), which is comprised of vehicle rental locations at most of the largest airports and cities in the world. 
The table below presents the approximate number of locations that comprise the Budget System as of December 31, 2017. 

 | Budget System Locations
 | Americas | International | | Total
Company-operated locations | 1,375 | | 750 | | 2,125
Licensee locations | 650 | | 1,150 | | 1,800
Total Budget System Locations | 2,025 | | 1,900 | | 3,925

In 2017, our company-operated Budget vehicle rental operations generated total revenue of approximately $2.6 billion, of which 82% was derived from operations in the Americas. In 2017, approximately $1.4 billion (or 77%) of our Budget T&M revenue was derived from leisure customers and $1.4 billion (or 76%) was derived from customers renting at airports. The following graphs present the approximate composition of our Budget revenue by segment and our Budget T&M revenue by customer and market in 2017.
We also license the Budget System to independent commercial owners who operate approximately half of our locations worldwide and generally pay royalty fees to us based on a percentage of applicable revenue. In 2017, approximately 28% of the global Budget System revenue was generated by our licensees. The graphs below present the approximate composition of the Budget System revenue in 2017.
Budget offers its customers several products and services similar to Avis, such as refueling options, roadside assistance, electronic toll collection and other supplemental rental products, emailed receipts and special rental rates for frequent renters. In addition, Budget’s mobile application allows customers to reserve, modify and cancel reservations on their smartphone, and its Fastbreak service, expedites rental service for frequent travelers.
12

Zipcar
Zipcar operates the world’s leading membership-based car sharing network and provides the freedom of “wheels when you want them” to members in over 500 cities and towns and on more than 600 college campuses across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Central America. Zipcar provides self-service vehicles in reserved parking spaces located in neighborhoods, business districts, office complexes, college campuses and airports. Members can reserve vehicles online, on a mobile device or over the phone, by the hour or by the day, at rates that include gasoline, insurance and other costs associated with vehicle ownership. In 2017, we widened Zipcar’s global network by launching operations in Taiwan, Costa Rica and Iceland. 
Budget Truck
Our Budget Truck rental business is one of the largest local and one-way truck rental businesses in the U.S. As of December 31, 2017, our Budget Truck fleet is comprised of approximately 19,000 vehicles that are rented through a network of approximately 925 dealer-operated and 450 Company-operated locations throughout the continental U.S. These dealers are independently-owned businesses that generally operate other retail service businesses. In addition to their principal businesses, the dealers rent our light- and medium-duty trucks to customers and are responsible for collecting payments on our behalf. The dealers receive a commission on all truck and ancillary equipment rentals. The Budget Truck rental business serves both the consumer and light commercial sectors. The consumer sector consists primarily of individuals who rent trucks to move household goods on either a one-way or local basis. The light commercial sector consists of a wide range of businesses that rent light- to medium-duty trucks, which we define as trucks having a gross vehicle weight of less than 26,000 pounds, for a variety of commercial applications.
Other Brands
Our Payless brand is a leading rental car supplier positioned to serve the deep-value segment of the industry. We operate or license the Payless brand, which is comprised of approximately 280 locations worldwide, including approximately 100 Company-operated locations and more than 180 locations operated by licensees. Company-operated Payless locations are primarily located in North America, the majority of which are at or near major airports. Payless’ base T&M fees are often lower than those of larger, more established brands, but Payless has historically achieved a greater penetration of ancillary products and services with its customers. The Payless business model allows the Company to extend the life cycle of a portion of our fleet, as we “cascade” certain vehicles that exceed certain Avis and Budget age or mileage thresholds to be used by Payless. 
Our Apex brand operates primarily in the deep-value segment of the vehicle rental industry in New Zealand and Australia, where we have approximately 25 rental locations. Apex operates its own rental fleet, separate from Avis and Budget vehicles with generally older and less expensive than vehicles offered by Avis and Budget. Apex generates substantially all of its reservations through its proprietary websites and contact center and typically has a greater-than-average length of rental. The substantial majority of Apex locations are at, or near, major airport locations.
Our Maggiore brand is a leading vehicle rental brand in Italy, where we operate or license approximately 140 rental locations under the Maggiore name. Our Maggiore brand has a strong domestic reputation and benefits from a strong presence at airport, off-airport and railway locations.  We have integrated numerous elements of Maggiore’s operations and fleet management into our existing processes. 
Our FranceCars brand operates one of the largest light commercial vehicle fleets in France from more than 70 rental locations. We have integrated a number of elements of FranceCar’s operations and fleet management into our existing processes.
RESERVATIONS, MARKETING AND SALES
Reservations
Our customers can make vehicle rental reservations through our brand-specific websites and through our toll-free reservation centers, by calling a specific location directly, through brand-specific mobile applications, through 
13

online travel agencies, through travel agents or through selected partners, including many major airlines, associations and retailers. Travel agents can access our reservation systems through all major global distribution systems (“GDSs”), which provide information with respect to rental locations, vehicle availability and applicable rate structures. 
Our Zipcar members may reserve cars by the hour or by the day through Zipcar’s reservation system, which is accessible through the Zipcar website, through the Zipcar application on their smartphone or by phone. We also provide two-way SMS texting, enabling us to proactively reach out to members during their reservation via their mobile device to manage their reservation, including instant reservation extension.
Marketing and Sales
We support our brands through a range of marketing channels and campaigns, including traditional off-line media, such as television and print advertising, as well as Internet and email marketing, social media and wireless mobile device applications. We market through sponsorships of major sports entities such as the PGA Tour and the New York Yankees and sponsorships of charitable organizations such as Make-A-Wish. We also utilize a customer relationship management system that enables us to deliver more targeted and relevant offers to customers across online and offline channels and allows our customers to benefit through better and more relevant marketing, improved service delivery and loyalty programs that reward frequent renters with free rental days and car class upgrades. 
In 2017, we continued to maintain, expand or enter into marketing alliances with key marketing partners that provide brand exposure and cross-marketing opportunities. For example, in 2017, we became the exclusive car rental partner of Hawaiian Airlines. We also extended or renewed our relationships with International Airlines Group (which includes British Airways, Iberia and Iberia Express and Aer Lingus), Choice Hotels International, and Travelport. Additionally, as the “Official Rental Car of the PGA TOUR,” Avis promoted its products and services to millions of golf enthusiasts worldwide through prominent advertising placements in PGA TOUR television broadcasts, scoreboards at tournaments, online media channels and additional official partner channels. 
We continue to maintain strong links to the travel industry including marketing alliances with numerous marketing partners in 2017:

• | We maintain marketing partnerships with many major airlines, including Air Canada, Air France, Air New Zealand, American Airlines, British Airways, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia Airlines, Japan Airlines, JetBlue Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Qantas, SAS, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America;


• | We also maintain marketing partnerships with many major hotel companies, including Best Western International, Inc., Hilton Hotels Corporation, Hyatt Corporation, MGM Resorts International, Radisson Hotels and Resorts, Universal Parks & Resorts and Wyndham Worldwide;


• | We offer customers the ability to earn frequent traveler points with many major airlines’ and hotels’ frequent traveler programs, and we are the exclusive rental partner of the Wyndham Rewards program; and


• | We have marketing relationships with numerous non-travel entities, such as affinity groups, membership organizations, retailers, financial institutions and credit card companies.


In 2017, approximately 60% of vehicle rental transactions from our Company-operated Avis locations were generated by travelers who rented from Avis under contracts between Avis and the travelers’ employers or through membership in an organization with which Avis has a contractual affiliation (such as AARP and Costco Wholesale). Avis maintains marketing relationships with other organizations such as American Express, MasterCard International and other organizations, through which we are able to provide their customers with incentives to rent from Avis. Avis licensees also generally have the option to participate in these affiliations.
Additionally, we offer “Unlimited Rewards®,” an award-winning loyalty incentive program for travel agents, and Avis and Budget programs for small businesses that offers discounted rates, central billing options and rental 
14

credits to members. Budget has contractual arrangements with American Express, MasterCard International and other organizations, which offer members incentives to rent from Budget. 
In 2017, Budget Truck signed an agreement with Costco offering Budget Truck rental services to the Costco membership community. Budget Truck also continued to maintain certain truck-rental-specific marketing and/or co-location relationships, such as with Simply Self Storage. We also have an exclusive agreement to advertise Budget Truck rental services in the Mover’s Guide, on the U.S. Postal Service change of address website.
Our Zipcar brand also partners with other active lifestyle brands that appeal to our Zipcar members and organizes, sponsors and participates in charitable and community events with organizations that are important to Zipcar members. Zipcar maintains close relationships with universities that allow us to market to the “next generation consumer” who, upon graduation, may migrate to the major metropolitan areas that we serve, continue their relationship with us and advocate for broad sponsorship of Zipcar membership at their places of work. Through our Zipcar for Business program, we also offer reduced weekday driving rates to employees of companies, federal agencies and local governments that sponsor the use of Zipcars. 
LICENSING
We have licensees in approximately 175 countries throughout the world. Royalty fee revenue derived from our vehicle rental licensees in 2017 totaled $136 million, with approximately $97 million in our International segment and $39 million in our Americas segment. Licensed locations are independently operated by our licensees and range from large operations at major airport locations and territories encompassing entire countries to relatively small operations in suburban or rural locations. Our licensees generally maintain separate independently owned and operated fleets. Royalties generated from licensing provide us with a source of high-margin revenue because there are relatively limited additional costs associated with fees paid by licensees to us. Locations operated by licensees represented approximately 50% of our Avis and Budget vehicle rental locations worldwide and approximately 29% of total revenue generated by the Avis and Budget Systems in 2017. We facilitate one-way vehicle rentals between Company-operated and licensed locations, which enables us to offer an integrated network of locations to our customers.
We generally enjoy good relationships with our licensees and meet regularly with them at regional, national and international meetings. Our relationships with our licensees are governed by license agreements that grant the licensee the right to operate independently operated vehicle rental businesses in certain territories. Our license agreements generally provide our licensees with the exclusive right to operate in their assigned territory. These agreements impose obligations on the licensee regarding its operations, and most agreements restrict the licensee’s ability to sell, transfer or assign its license agreement and capital stock. 
The terms of our license agreements, including duration, royalty fees and termination provisions, vary based upon brand, territory, and original signing date. Royalty fees are generally structured to be a percentage of the licensee’s gross rental income. We maintain the right to monitor the operations of licensees and, when applicable, can declare a licensee to be in default under its license agreement. We perform audits as part of our program to assure licensee compliance with brand quality standards and contract provisions. Generally, we can terminate license agreements for certain defaults, including failure to pay royalties or adhere to our operational standards. Upon termination of a license agreement, the licensee is prohibited from using our brand names and related marks in any business. In the U.S., these license relationships constitute “franchises” under most federal and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises and the relationship of the parties to a franchise agreement.
We continue to optimize the Avis and Budget Systems by issuing new license agreements and evaluating strategic acquisitions of licensees to grow our revenues and expand our global presence. Our acquisitions of licensees over the last three years include locations in Brazil, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Poland as well as in local markets in Canada and the United States.
OTHER REVENUE
In addition to revenue from our vehicle rentals and licensee royalties, we generate revenue from our customers through the sale and/or rental of optional ancillary products and services. We offer products to customers that will enhance their rental experience, including:
15


• | collision and loss damage waivers, under which we agree to relieve a customer from financial responsibility arising from vehicle damage incurred during the rental such as additional/supplemental liability insurance or personal accident/effects insurance;


• | products for driving convenience such as fuel service options, chauffeur drive services, roadside assistance services, electronic toll collection, tablet rentals, access to satellite radio, portable navigation units and child safety seat rentals; and


• | products that supplement truck rental including automobile towing equipment and other moving accessories such as hand trucks, furniture pads and moving supplies.

We also receive payment from our customers for certain operating expenses that we incur, including vehicle licensing fees, as well as airport concession fees that we pay in exchange for the right to operate at airports and other locations. In addition, we collect membership fees in connection with our car sharing business.
OUR TECHNOLOGIES
Vehicle Rental
We use a broad range of technologies in our vehicle rental operations, substantially all of which are linked to what we call our Wizard system, which is a worldwide reservation, rental, fleet control, data processing and information management system. The Wizard system enables us to process millions of incoming customer inquiries each day, providing our customers with accurate and timely information about our locations, rental rates and vehicle availability, as well as the ability to place or modify reservations. Additionally, the Wizard system is linked to all major travel distribution networks worldwide and provides real-time processing for travel agents, travel industry partners (such as airlines and online travel sites), corporate travel departments and individual consumers through our websites or contact centers. The Wizard system also provides personal profile information to our reservation and rental agents to help us better serve our customers. 
We also use data supplied from the Wizard system and other third-party reservation and information management systems to maintain centralized control of major business processes such as fleet acquisition and logistics, sales to corporate accounts and determination of rental rates. The principal components of the systems we employ include: 

• | Fleet planning model. We have a comprehensive decision tool to develop fleet plans and schedules for the acquisition and disposition of our fleet, along with fleet age, mix, mileage and cost reports based upon these plans and schedules. This tool allows management to monitor and change fleet deployment on a daily basis and to optimize our fleet plan based on estimated business levels and available repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs. We also use third-party software to further optimize our fleet acquisition, deployment and disposition activities.


• | Yield management system. We have a yield management system which is designed to enhance profits by providing greater control of vehicle availability and rate availability changes at our rental locations. Our system monitors and forecasts both supply and demand to support our efforts to optimize volume and rate at each location. Integrated into this yield management system is a fleet distribution module that takes into consideration the costs as well as the potential benefits associated with distributing vehicles to various rental locations within a geographic area to accommodate rental demand at these locations. The fleet distribution module makes specific recommendations for movement of vehicles between locations.


• | Pricing decision support systems. Pricing in our industry is highly competitive and complex. To improve our ability to respond to rental rate changes in the marketplace, we have utilized sophisticated systems to gather and report competitive industry rental rate changes every day. Our systems, using data from third-party reservation systems as its source of information, automatically scan rate movements and report significant changes to our staff of pricing analysts for evaluation. These systems greatly enhance our ability to gather and respond to rate changes in the marketplace. In 2017, we continued to implement an integrated pricing and fleet optimization tool that has allowed us to test and implement improved pricing strategies and optimization algorithms, as well as automate the implementation of certain price changes.

16


• | Websites and Mobile Applications. We have developed brand-specific websites and mobile applications that leverage our technology across brands and provide the flexibility and ease of transacting that our customers demand for their interactions with us. Our websites and apps are optimized for various devices and provide a simple interface for each mode of communication such as computer, smartphone, tablets and other electronic devices.


• | Customer service applications. Our customer service applications are comprehensive case management systems that our customer care agents use to handle a variety of issues and questions from our customers. Our multi-branded systems interface with our Wizard system and give our agents current and historical information about a caller so that they are better equipped to provide informed and expedited assistance, while at the same time allowing us to be consistent in our case handling and responses.


• | Enterprise data warehouse. We have developed a sophisticated and comprehensive electronic data storage and retrieval system which retains information related to various aspects of our business. This data warehouse allows us to take advantage of comprehensive management reports and provides easy access to data for strategic decision making for our brands.


• | Sales and marketing system. We have developed a sophisticated system of online data tracking which enables our sales force to analyze key account information of our corporate customers including historical and current rental activity, revenue and booking sources, top renting locations, rate usage categories and customer satisfaction data. We use this information, which is updated weekly and captured on a country-by-country basis, to assess opportunities for revenue growth, profitability and improvement.


• | Campaign management. We have deployed tools that enable us to recognize customer segments and value, and to automatically present appropriate offers on our websites.


• | Interactive adjustments. We have developed a customer data system that allows us to easily retrieve pertinent customer information and make needed adjustments to completed rental transactions online for superior customer service. This data system links with our other accounting systems to handle any charge card transaction automatically.


• | Interactive voice response system. We have developed an automated voice response system that enables the automated processing of customer reservation confirmations, cancellations, identification of rental locations, extension of existing rentals and requests for copies of rental receipts over the phone using speech recognition software.

Car Sharing
Our Zipcar car sharing technology was specifically designed and built for our car sharing business and has been continually refined and upgraded. Our fully-integrated platform centralizes the management of our Zipcar reservations, member services, fleet operations and financial systems to optimize the member experience, minimize costs and leverage efficiencies. Through this platform, we: 

• | process new member applications;


• | provide the mobile and website applications used by members to make and manage reservations and maintain account information;


• | manage reservations and provide keyless vehicle access;


• | manage and monitor member interactions and communications, including through interactive voice response systems, email and text messaging;


• | integrate with third parties that provide additional services such as gas cards and mapping;


• | manage billing and payment processing across multiple currencies;

17


• | manage our car sharing fleet, including scheduled service and cleanings and vehicle issue tracking and resolution;


• | manage vehicle locations and location information, including parking agreements; and


• | monitor and analyze key metrics of each Zipcar such as utilization rate, mileage and maintenance requirements.

Each Zipcar is typically equipped with a combination of telematics modules, including a control unit with mobile data service, radio frequency identification card readers, wireless antennae, wiring harness, vehicle interface modules and transponders for toll systems. This hardware, together with internally developed embedded firmware, vehicle communication protocols and datacenter software, allows us to authorize secure access to our Zipcars from our data centers and provides us with a comprehensive set of fleet management data that is stored in our centralized database. 
Interactions between members and our Zipcars are captured in our system, across all communication channels, providing us with knowledge we use to improve our members’ experiences and optimize our business processes. We have built and continue to innovate upon our technology platform in order to provide scale to support growth, drive operational efficiency and improve the member experience.
OUR FLEET
We offer a wide variety of vehicles in our rental fleet, including luxury cars and specialty-use vehicles. Our fleet consists primarily of vehicles from the current and immediately preceding model year. We maintain a single fleet of vehicles for Avis and Budget in countries where we operate both brands. The substantial majority of Zipcar’s fleet is dedicated to use by Zipcar, but we have developed processes to share vehicles between the Avis/Budget fleet and Zipcar’s fleet, primarily to help meet Zipcar’s demand peaks. We maintain a diverse rental fleet, in which no vehicle manufacturer represented more than 15% of our 2017 fleet purchases, and we regularly adjust our fleet levels to be consistent with demand. We participate in a variety of vehicle purchase programs with major vehicle manufacturers. In 2017, we purchased vehicles from Citroen, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes, Nissan, Opel, Peugeot, Renault, Seat, Toyota, and Volkswagen, among others. During 2017, approximately 15%, 14% and 10% of the vehicles acquired for our rental fleet were manufactured by Ford, Fiat Chrysler, and General Motors, respectively.
Fleet costs represented approximately 26% of our aggregate expenses in 2017. Fleet costs can vary from year to year based on the prices at which we are able to purchase and dispose of rental vehicles. 
In 2017, on average, approximately 37% of our rental car fleet was comprised of vehicles subject to agreements requiring automobile manufacturers to repurchase vehicles at a specified price during a specified time period or guarantee our rate of depreciation on the vehicles during a specified period of time, or were vehicles subject to operating leases, which are subject to a fixed lease period and interest rate. We refer to cars subject to these agreements as “program” cars and cars not subject to these agreements as “risk” cars because we retain the risk associated with such cars’ residual values at the time of their disposition. The following graphs present the approximate percentage of program cars in both our average rental car fleet and fleet purchases within each of our reporting segments in the last three years.
18


Our agreements with automobile manufacturers typically require that we pay more for program cars and maintain them in our fleet for a minimum number of months and impose certain return conditions, including car condition and mileage requirements. When we return program cars to the manufacturer, we receive the price guaranteed at the time of purchase and are thus protected from fluctuations in the prices of previously-owned vehicles in the wholesale market. In 2017, approximately 57% of the vehicles we disposed of were sold pursuant to repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs. The future percentages of program and risk cars in our fleet will depend on several factors, including our expectations for future used car prices, our seasonal needs and the availability and attractiveness of manufacturers’ repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs. The Company has agreed to purchase approximately $8.1 billion of program vehicles from manufacturers in 2018.
We dispose of our risk cars largely through automobile auctions, including auctions that enable dealers to purchase vehicles online more quickly than through traditional auctions and direct-to-dealer sales. In 2017, we continued to expand the number of states that can participate in our Ultimate Test Drive consumer car sales program, which offers customers the ability to purchase our rental vehicles. Alternative disposition channels such as Ultimate Test Drive, online auctions, retail lots and direct to dealer sales represented approximately 50% of our risk vehicle dispositions in the Americas in 2017 and provide us with per-vehicle cost savings compared to selling cars at auctions.
For 2017, our average monthly vehicle rental fleet size ranged from a low of approximately 534,000 vehicles in January to a high of approximately 721,000 vehicles in July. Our average monthly car rental fleet size typically peaks in the summer months. Average fleet utilization for 2017, which is based on the number of rental days (or portion thereof) that vehicles are rented compared to the total amount of time that vehicles are available for rent, ranged from 64% in January to 76% in August. Our calculation of utilization may not be comparable to other companies’ calculation of similarly titled statistics.
We place a strong emphasis on vehicle maintenance for customer safety and customer satisfaction reasons, and because quick and proper repairs are critical to fleet utilization. To accomplish this task we have developed specialized training programs for our technicians. Our Maintenance and Damage Planning Department prepares technical service bulletins that can be retrieved electronically at our repair locations. In addition, we have implemented policies and procedures to promptly address manufacturer recalls as part of our ongoing maintenance and repair efforts.

CUSTOMER SERVICE
We believe our commitment to delivering a consistently high level of customer service across all of our brands is a critical element of our success and strategy. Our Customer Led, Service Driven™ program focuses on improving the overall customer experience based on our research of customer service practices, improved customer insights, executing our customer relationship management strategy, delivering customer-centric employee training and leverage our mobile app technology and the enriched experience it provides our customers. 
Our associates and managers at our Company-operated locations are trained and empowered to resolve most customer issues at the location level. We also continuously track customer-satisfaction levels by sending location-specific surveys to recent customers and utilize detailed reports and tracking to assess and identify ways that we can improve our customer service delivery and the overall customer experience. In 2017, we received feedback from more than 2 million customers globally. Our location-specific surveys ask customers to evaluate their overall satisfaction with their rental experience and the likelihood that they will recommend our brands, as well as key elements of the rental experience. Results are analyzed in aggregate and by location to help further enhance our service levels to our customers.
We place a high emphasis on valuing our customers’ time through providing complete control with self-service capabilities. While our moble apps provide a fast customer experience, our customers know a company representative is always available to meet their needs. In 2017, we expanded our survey platform to integrate app-specific questions to learn more about individual preferences and find innovative ways to better serve and anticipate our customers’ needs.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 31,000 people worldwide, of whom approximately 9,400 were employed on a part-time basis. Of our approximately 31,000 employees, approximately 20,000 were employed in our Americas segment and 11,000 in our International segment. 
In our Americas segment, the majority of our employees are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. Certain of our executive officers may be employed under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits. In our International segment, we enter into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. Many of our employees are covered by a wide variety of union contracts and governmental regulations affecting, among other things, compensation, job retention rights and pensions.
As of December 31, 2017, approximately 32% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements with various labor unions. We believe our employee relations are satisfactory. We have never experienced a large-scale work stoppage. 
AIRPORT CONCESSION AGREEMENTS
We generally operate our vehicle rental and car sharing services at airports under concession agreements with airport authorities, pursuant to which we typically make airport concession payments and/or lease payments. In general, concession fees for on-airport locations are based on a percentage of total commissionable revenue (as defined by each airport authority), often subject to minimum annual guaranteed amounts. Concessions are typically awarded by airport authorities every three to ten years based upon competitive bids. Our concession agreements with the various airport authorities generally impose certain minimum operating requirements, provide for relocation in the event of future construction and provide for abatement of the minimum annual guarantee in the event of extended low passenger volume.

OTHER BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS

SEASONALITY
Our vehicle rental business is subject to seasonal variations in customer demand patterns, with the spring and summer vacation periods representing our peak seasons for the majority of the countries in which we operate. We 
20

vary our fleet size over the course of the year to help manage any seasonal variations in demand, as well as localized changes in demand. The following chart presents our quarterly revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
COMPETITION
The competitive environment for our industry is generally characterized by intense price and service competition among global, local and regional competitors. Competition in our vehicle rental operations is based primarily upon price, customer service quality, including usability of booking systems and ease of rental and return, vehicle availability, reliability, rental locations, product innovation and national or international distribution. In addition, competition is also influenced strongly by advertising, marketing, loyalty programs and brand reputation. We believe the prominence and service reputation of our brands, extensive worldwide ownership of mobility solutions and commitment to innovating will provide us with a competitive advantage.
The use of technology has increased pricing transparency among vehicle rental companies and other mobility solutions providers by enabling cost-conscious customers to more easily compare on the Internet and their mobile devices the rates available for the mobility solutions that fit their needs. This transparency has further increased the prevalence and intensity of price competition in the industry. 
Our vehicle rental operations compete primarily with Enterprise Holdings, Inc., which operates the Enterprise, National and Alamo car rental brands; Hertz Global Holdings, Inc., which operates the Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands; Europcar Group; and Sixt AG. In addition there are smaller local and regional vehicle rental companies and ride-hailing companies that we compete with largely for short length trips in urban areas. Our Zipcar brand also competes with various local and regional mobility companies, including mobility services sponsored by several auto manufacturers, ride-hailing and car sharing companies and other technology players in the mobility landscape. Our Budget Truck operations in the U.S. competes with several other local, regional and nationwide truck rental companies such as U-Haul International, Inc., Penske Truck Leasing Corporation, Ryder Systems, Inc. and Enterprise.
INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Our vehicle rental and corporate operations expose us to various types of claims for bodily injury, death and property damage related to the use of our vehicles and/or properties, as well as general employment-related matters stemming from our operations. We generally assume the risk of liability to third parties arising from vehicle rental and car sharing services in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, in accordance with the minimum financial responsibility requirements (“MFRs”) and primacy of coverage laws of the relevant jurisdiction. In certain cases, we assume liability above applicable MFRs, but to no more than $1 million per occurrence, other than in cases involving a negligent act on the part of the Company, for which we purchase insurance coverage for exposures beyond retained amounts from a combination of unaffiliated excess insurers. 
21

In Europe, we insure the risk of liability to third parties arising from vehicle rental and car sharing services in accordance with local regulatory requirements through a combination of insurance policies provided by unaffiliated insurers and through reinsurance. We may retain a portion of the insured risk of liability, including reinsuring certain risks through our captive insurance subsidiary AEGIS Motor Insurance Limited. We limit our retained risk of liability through the unaffiliated insurers. We insure the risk of liability to third parties in Argentina, Australasia and Brazil through a combination of unaffiliated insurers and one of our affiliates. These insurers provide insurance coverage supplemental to minimum local requirements. 
We offer our U.S. customers a range of optional insurance products and coverages such as supplemental liability insurance, personal accident insurance, personal effects protection, emergency sickness protection, automobile towing protection and cargo insurance, which create additional risk exposure for us. When a customer elects to purchase supplemental liability insurance or other optional insurance related products, we typically retain economic exposure to loss, since the insurance is provided by an unaffiliated insurer that is reinsuring its exposure through our captive insurance subsidiary, Constellation Reinsurance Co., Ltd. Additional personal accident insurance offered to our customers in Europe is provided by a third-party insurer, and reinsured by our Avis Budget Europe International Reinsurance Limited subsidiary. We also maintain excess insurance coverage through unaffiliated carriers to help mitigate our potential exposure to large liability losses. We otherwise bear these and other risks, except to the extent that the risks are transferred through insurance or contractual arrangements. 
OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We rely primarily on a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright laws, as well as contractual provisions with employees and third parties, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. The service marks “Avis,” “Budget,” and “Zipcar” and related marks or designs incorporating such terms and related logos and marks such as “We try harder,” and “wheels when you want them” are material to our vehicle rental and car sharing businesses. Our subsidiaries and licensees actively use these marks. All of the material marks used by Avis, Budget and Zipcar are registered (or have applications pending for registration) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as in foreign jurisdictions. Our subsidiaries own the marks and other intellectual property, including the Wizard system, used in our business. We also own trademarks and logos related to the “Apex Car Rentals” brand in Australia and New Zealand, the “Payless Car Rental” brand in the United States and several other countries, the “Maggiore” brand in Italy and the “FranceCars” brand in France. 
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
At Avis Budget Group, we take our responsibilities as a corporate citizen seriously. We remain aware of how our actions can benefit the community and are sensitive to the needs of the environment, our customers and our employees. We recognize that being a successful organization means our progress is measured not only in economic terms, but also in the many ways we impact the world around us.
We believe in being responsible global corporate citizens and strive to establish and maintain best practices in corporate social responsibility through a focus on:

• | The Environment: As a responsible corporate citizen, we are committed to monitoring, measuring and managing our environmental impact, and working to reduce it where practicable on an ongoing basis. The following illustrate those commitments:

Car Sharing: Through our Zipcar brand, operating the world’s leading car-sharing network, considered to be one of the most environmentally-friendly transportation alternatives available;
Fleet: Offering our customers a wide variety of vehicles that are environmentally friendly, including as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s SmartWay Certification Program;
Outreach: Partnering with our corporate customers to help them measure and manage the environmental impact of Avis and Budget rental vehicles used by their employees and, where applicable, partnering to help them achieve their sustainability goals;
22

Compliance: Meeting or voluntarily exceeding the requirements of all federal, state and local health, safety and environmental protection laws; and
Reduction: Limiting our use of natural resources and recycling where practicable, whether water, oil, tire rubber, paper, plastic or other materials.

• | Our People and our Customers: We believe that our success has its foundation in how we treat our employees. Avis Budget Group is committed to maintaining a professional and supportive workplace built on trust between employees and management. In concert with our core values, we seek to foster an environment where communication among our employees is open, honest, and respectful; performance is recognized; growth is encouraged; and accomplishments – individual and collective – are celebrated. We also seek to support the well-being and development of the people we employ and the communities in which they work. The following initiatives reflect our commitment to achieving these goals:

Employee Satisfaction: We periodically measure the success of our workplace initiatives in a Company-wide employee survey. Conducted by an independent third party to ensure impartiality and confidentiality, the survey is part of a long tradition of listening to what employees have to say about the Company, about the job they do, and about what they expect. On average, over 90% of all employees respond, which we feel is best in class participation and engagement. The findings from each survey are presented by managers to employees and plans to address areas for improvement are established;
Employee Benefits Programs: Our employees are critical to our success. To ensure their well-being and professional growth, we generally offer a competitive salary, plus incentive compensation potential and comprehensive benefits. In addition, we offer health and welfare benefits that may include a range of training, employee assistance and personal development programs to help employees and their families prosper. Our employee benefit programs are all offered and administered in compliance with applicable local law;
Live Well – Healthy Living: We maintain a comprehensive program of initiatives designed to encourage our employees and their families to be mindful of their health and to enhance their ability to care for themselves and manage their health care expenses;
Equal Opportunity Employment: We are committed to providing equal employment opportunity to all applicants and employees without regard to race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, protected veteran or disability status or any factor prohibited by law, and as such we affirm in policy and practice to support and promote the concept of equal employee opportunity and affirmative action, in accordance with all applicable federal, state, provincial and municipal laws. In addition, the Company will reasonably accommodate known disabilities and religious beliefs of employees and qualified applicants; and
Diversity: As a growing global organization, the Company is proud of the diversity of its workforce. We strive to attract and retain talented and diverse people throughout our organization by engaging in several initiatives to support diversity, including programs specifically designed to develop female leaders and to assist current and former military personnel.

• | Our Communities: The Company is committed to supporting the communities in which it operates by working with nonprofit organizations focused on assisting those in need such as Make-A-Wish. Through relationships with widely-recognized charitable groups and outreach through the Avis Budget Group Charitable Foundation and employee volunteer teams, the Company and its employees contribute to many worthwhile organizations and deserving causes that help improve our communities.


• | Our Business: We hold our employees to high ethical standards. We place great emphasis on professional conduct, safety and security, information protection and integrity.

Ethical Standards: Our employees are required to follow our Code of Conduct. This important document represents the core of our business philosophy and values and covers numerous areas, including standards of work-related behavior; safe work practices; security of information, 
23

systems and other assets; conflicts of interest; securities laws; and community service. We provide employees with training to help them understand both our Code of Conduct and how to interpret it in various situations.
Sustainable Procurement: Our Third Party Standards of Conduct represents the Company’s commitment to fostering sustainable relationships with our business partners, agents, consultants, suppliers and other third parties and ensuring that they uphold ethical, social and environmental standards.
Supplier Diversity: The Company also maintains an industry-leading supplier diversity program to promote the growth and development of suppliers who are disadvantaged, minority-owned or women-owned business enterprises. As a result of our commitment, we are honored to be one of America’s Top Corporations for Women’s Business Enterprises for 16 consecutive years and a corporate member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable.
Data Protection: We are committed to taking appropriate measures to properly secure information, records, systems and property. Employees are trained to take particular precautions to protect the Company, our employees, vendors and customers, and, in many cases, themselves, from the unlawful or inappropriate use or disclosure of that information.
