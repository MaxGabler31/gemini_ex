Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “Owens Corning,” “Company,” “we” and “our” in this report refer to Owens Corning and its subsidiaries. References to a particular year mean the Company’s year commencing on January 1 and ending on December 31 of that year.
SEGMENT OVERVIEW
The Company has an integrated business model with three reportable segments: Composites, Insulation and Roofing. Our Composites, Insulation and Roofing reportable segments accounted for approximately 27%, 36% and 37% of our total reportable segment net sales, respectively, in 2021.
Composites
Owens Corning glass fiber materials can be found in over 40,000 end-use applications primarily within three markets: building and construction, renewable energy and infrastructure. Such end-use applications include building structures, roofing shingles, tubs and showers, pools, flooring, pipes and tanks, poles, electrical equipment and wind-energy turbine blades. Our products are manufactured and sold worldwide. We primarily sell our products directly to parts molders and fabricators. Within the building and construction market, our Composites segment sells glass fiber and/or glass mat directly to a small number of major shingle manufacturers, including our own Roofing segment.
Our Composites segment includes vertically integrated material solutions. The Company manufactures, fabricates and sells glass reinforcements in the form of fiber. Glass reinforcement materials are also used downstream by the Composites segment to manufacture and sell glass fiber products in the form of fabrics, non-wovens and other specialized products.
Demand for composites is driven by general global economic activity and, more specifically, by the increasing replacement of traditional materials such as aluminum, wood and steel with composites that offer lighter weight, improved strength, lack of conductivity and corrosion resistance. 
We compete with glass fiber manufacturers worldwide. According to various industry reports and Company estimates, our Composites segment is a world leader in the production of glass fiber reinforcement materials. Primary methods of competition include innovation, quality, customer service and global geographic reach. 
Insulation
Our insulating products provide a variety of benefits such as energy conservation, thermal functionality, improved acoustical performance and convenience of installation and use. Our Insulation segment includes a diverse portfolio of high, mid and low-temperature products with a geographic mix of United States, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, a market mix of residential, commercial, industrial and other markets, and a channel mix of retail, contractor and distribution.
Our products in the North American residential market include thermal and acoustical batts, loosefill insulation, foam sheathing and accessories, and are sold under well-recognized brand names and trademarks such as Owens Corning PINK® FIBERGLAS™ Insulation. Our products in the commercial and industrial markets include glass fiber pipe insulation, energy efficient flexible duct media, bonded and granulated mineral wool insulation, cellular glass insulation and foam insulation used in above- and below-grade construction applications, and are sold under well-recognized brand names and trademarks such as

ITEM 1. | BUSINESS (continued)

Thermafiber®, FOAMULAR®, FOAMGLAS® and Paroc®. We sell our insulation products primarily to insulation installers, home centers, lumberyards, retailers and distributors in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America.
Demand for Owens Corning’s insulating products is driven by North American new residential construction, repair and remodeling activity, commercial and industrial construction activity in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, and increasingly stringent building codes and the growing need for energy efficiency. Demand in the segment typically follows seasonal home improvement, remodeling and renovation and residential, commercial and industrial construction industry patterns. Demand for residential insulation in North America typically follows housing starts on a three-month lagged basis, although the new residential construction cycle can elongate due to labor availability and other factors beyond our control. The peak season for home construction and remodeling in our geographic markets generally corresponds with the second and third calendar quarters. Demand for commercial and industrial applications is more heavily tied to industrial production growth, commercial construction activity, and overall economic conditions in the global markets we serve.
Our Insulation segment competes primarily with fiberglass insulation manufacturers in the United States, with an international presence in Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. According to industry reports and Company estimates, Owens Corning is North America’s largest producer of residential, commercial and industrial insulation. Principal methods of competition include innovation and product design, service, location, quality, price and compatibility of systems solutions. 
Working capital practices for this segment historically have followed a seasonal cycle. Typically, our insulation plants run continuously throughout the year. This production plan, along with the seasonal nature of portions of the segment, generally results in higher finished goods inventory balances in the first half of the year. Since sales increase during the second half of the year, our accounts receivable balances are typically higher during this period. 
Roofing
Our primary products in the Roofing segment are laminate and strip asphalt roofing shingles. Other products include roofing components, synthetic packaging materials and oxidized asphalt. We have been able to meet the growing demand for longer lasting, aesthetically attractive laminate products with modest capital investment.

We sell shingles and roofing components primarily through distributors, home centers, lumberyards, retailers and contractors in the United States. Our synthetic packaging materials are used primarily in the construction industry for lumber and metal packaging. Oxidized asphalt is a significant input used in the production of our asphalt roofing shingles. We are vertically integrated and have manufacturing facilities that process asphalt for use in our roofing shingles manufacturing process. In addition, we sell processed asphalt to other shingle manufacturers, to roofing contractors for built-up roofing asphalt systems and to manufacturers in a variety of other industries, including automotive, chemical, rubber and construction. Asphalt input costs and third-party asphalt sales prices are correlated to crude oil prices. 
Demand for products in our Roofing segment is generally driven by both residential repair and remodeling activity and by new residential construction. Roofing damage from major storms can significantly increase demand in this segment. As a result, sales in this segment do not always follow seasonal home improvement, remodeling and new construction industry patterns as closely as our Insulation segment.
Our Roofing segment competes primarily with asphalt shingle manufacturers in the United States. According to various industry reports and Company estimates, Owens Corning’s Roofing segment is the second largest producer of asphalt roofing shingles in the United States. Principal methods of competition include innovation and product design, proximity to customers, quality and price. 
Our manufacturing operations are generally continuous in nature, and we warehouse much of our production prior to sale since we operate with relatively short delivery cycles. One of the raw materials important to this segment is sourced from a sole supplier. We have a long-term supply contract for this material, and have no reason to believe that any availability issues will exist. If this supply was to become unavailable, our production could be interrupted until such time as the supplies again became available or the Company reformulated its products. Additionally, the supply of asphalt, another significant raw material in this segment, has been constricted at times. Although this has not caused an interruption of our production in the past, prolonged asphalt shortages would restrict our ability to produce products in this segment.

GENERAL
Intellectual Property
The Company relies on a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property, proprietary technology and our brands. Through continuous and extensive use of the color PINK since 1956, Owens Corning became the first owner of a single color trademark registration. In addition to our Owens Corning and PINK brands, the Company has registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, and domain names. Additionally, the Company owns numerous U.S. and international patents and patent applications, covering certain of our proprietary technology resulting from research and development efforts. Over time, the Company has assembled a portfolio of intellectual property rights including patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, know-how and trade secrets covering our products, services and manufacturing processes. Our proprietary technology is not dependent on any single or group of intellectual property rights and the Company does not expect the expiration of existing intellectual property to have a material adverse effect on the business as a whole. The Company believes the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. Although the Company protects its intellectual property and proprietary technology, any significant impairment of, or third-party claim against, our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.
Environmental Control
Owens Corning has established policies and procedures to ensure that its operations are conducted in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations and that enable the Company to meet its high standards for corporate sustainability and environmental stewardship. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the presence of hazardous materials, pollution and protection of the environment, including emissions to air, discharges to water, management of hazardous materials, handling and disposal of solid wastes, and remediation of contaminated sites. All Company manufacturing facilities operate using an ISO 14001 or equivalent environmental management system. The Company’s 2030 Sustainability Goals require significant global reductions in energy use, water consumption, waste to landfill, emissions of greenhouse gases, fine particulate matter and toxic air emissions. The Company is dedicated to continuous improvement in our environmental, health and safety performance and to achieving its 2030 Sustainability Goals. 
The Company has not experienced a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures or competitive position as a result of environmental control legislation and regulations. Operating costs associated with environmental compliance were approximately $42 million in 2021. The Company continues to invest in equipment and process modifications to remain in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations worldwide.
Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous national, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations. Regulatory activities of particular importance to our operations include those addressing air pollution, water pollution, waste disposal and chemical control. It is possible that new laws and regulations will specifically address climate change, volatile organic compounds, ozone forming emissions and fine particulate matter. New environmental and chemical regulations could impact our ability to expand production or construct new facilities in geographic regions in which we operate. However, based on information known to the Company, including the nature of our manufacturing operations and associated air emissions, at this time we do not expect any of these new laws, regulations or activities to have a material adverse effect on our results of current operations, financial condition or long-term liquidity.
Owens Corning is involved in remedial response activities and is responsible for environmental remediation at a number of sites, including certain of its currently owned or formerly owned plants. These responsibilities arise under a number of laws, including, but not limited to, the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and similar state or local laws pertaining to the management and remediation of hazardous materials and petroleum. The Company has also been named a potentially responsible party under the United States Federal Superfund law, or state equivalents, at a number of disposal sites. The Company became involved in these sites as a result of government action or in connection with business acquisitions. At the end of 2021, the Company was involved with a total of 22 sites worldwide, including 9 Superfund sites and 13 owned or formerly owned sites. None of the liabilities for these sites are individually significant to the Company.

ITEM 1. | BUSINESS (continued)

Remediation activities generally involve a potential range of activities and costs related to soil and groundwater contamination. This can include pre-cleanup activities such as fact finding and investigation, risk assessment, feasibility studies, remedial action design and implementation (where actions may range from monitoring to removal of contaminants, to installation of longer-term remediation systems). A number of factors affect the cost of environmental remediation, including the number of parties involved in a particular site, the determination of the extent of contamination, the length of time the remediation may require, the complexity of environmental regulations, variability in clean-up standards, the need for legal action, and changes in remediation technology. Taking these factors into account, Owens Corning has predicted the costs of remediation reasonably estimated to be paid over a period of years. The Company accrues an amount on an undiscounted basis, consistent with the reasonable estimates of these costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred. Actual cost may differ from these estimates for the reasons mentioned above. 
At December 31, 2021, the Company had an accrual totaling $6 million for its environmental liabilities, of which the current portion is $3 million. Changes in required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures at existing legacy sites, or discovery of contamination at additional sites, could result in material increases to the Company’s environmental obligations.
Additional Government Laws and Regulations
In addition to environmental laws and regulations, we are subject to various laws and regulations around the world. For example, trade regulations, including tariffs or other import or export restrictions, may increase the cost of some of our raw materials or cross-border shipments, and limit our ability to do business in certain countries or with certain individuals. Our business is also subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the United States, as well as similar foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition, and such laws and regulations may impact potential business relationships or transactions with third parties in the future. In addition, health and safety regulations (including laws or regulations promulgated in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed below in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”) have necessitated, and may continue to necessitate, increased operating costs or capital investments to promote a safe working environment. The Company is also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. Further, an increasing number of laws and regulations focused on product and chemical hazards, including regulations concerning the impact of product manufacturing and use on climate change, and resulting preferential product selection could also impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain products or require significant research and development investment and capital expenditures to meet regulatory requirements. With respect to the laws and regulations noted above, as well as other applicable laws and regulations, the Company’s compliance programs may under certain circumstances involve material investments in the form of additional processes, training, personnel, information technology and capital. For a discussion of the risks associated with certain applicable laws and regulations, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Sustainability
As a worldwide leader in our industry, we have the desire to be at the forefront of corporate sustainability efforts. It is our ambition to be a net-positive company, that is, one whose environmental handprint, or the positive impact of our people and products, is greater than our environmental footprint, or the negative impact of manufacturing our products. We work to continually increase the good our people and products do while we concurrently reduce the negative environmental impact of our operations. 
Our climate-related sustainability efforts have led Owens Corning to develop a range of strategies and tactics that have had a significant impact on the way we conduct our business. We strive to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions released throughout the entire life cycle of our products by improving the use-phase impacts of our products, making our manufacturing processes more energy-efficient, sourcing more renewable electricity, improving our supply chain logistics, increasing recycled content, and developing end-of-life recycling solutions. Together, this work reduces the environmental impact of our operations and lowers the embodied carbon in our products – an attribute of growing importance to our customers.
Many of Owens Corning’s products are made using heavy, industrialized manufacturing processes. While we strive to go beyond all regulatory requirements, our factories do produce various emissions, including greenhouse gases. Owens Corning is subject to or has chosen to voluntarily participate in Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) around the world. Broad and gradual tightening of national, regional, and state government limits on emissions could disrupt our access to energy sources or specific raw materials, which in turn could disrupt the manufacturing of products dependent upon them. Owens Corning invests in research and development on climate-related risks and opportunities.

Human Capital Resources
Important to the Company’s long-term success is ensuring its people feel valued, included, and engaged – from recruitment to retirement. That is why Owens Corning is dedicated to fostering an environment of learning and growth within a supportive, caring culture. We are committed to providing a safe, healthy workplace and a meaningful, engaging employee experience. 
As of December 31, 2021, Owens Corning had approximately 20,000 employees, of which about 11,000 are located outside the United States. Approximately 9,000 (62%) of hourly employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes that its relations with employees are good.
The Company focuses on a number of human capital resource objectives in managing its business which, taken together, may be material to understanding our business under certain circumstances. 
Safety and Well-Being
One of our primary objectives is the safety and well-being of our employees. Working safely is an unconditional, organization-wide expectation at Owens Corning, which we believe directly benefits employees’ lives, improves our manufacturing processes and reduces our costs.  The Company maintains comprehensive safety programs focused on identifying hazards and eliminating risks that can lead to severe injuries.  One of our primary safety measures is the Recordable Incidence Rate (“RIR”) as defined by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our RIR was 0.59, compared to 0.64 in the same period a year ago.
Additionally, with our Healthy Living platform, we provide a multifaceted well-being program designed to drive sustainable, long-term change, improve the health and lives of employees, and strengthen the culture and work experience.
Employee Performance and Related Objectives 
We also focus on managing employee performance, development, succession planning, and turnover. Our goal is to create a high-performance culture and team that is diverse, capable and engaged.  We strive to have clear objectives, effective performance management, and a structure that includes regular talent reviews, succession planning, development, and compensation analysis. 
Corporate Culture
Another objective we pursue is maintaining a corporate culture focused on inclusion and diversity, ethics and compliance, training, and positive employee relations and engagement.
The Company believes its success and sustainability are enhanced by an inclusive and diverse workforce. We believe that inclusion and diversity add value to the business by fostering an environment that leads to high engagement and innovative thinking in the workplace. Our Chief Executive Officer, along with more than a thousand other company leaders around the world, signed the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge in 2018, signaling our goal to advance diversity and inclusion within the workplace.  Owens Corning operates programs that foster gender and ethnic diversity as well as equality within its workforce, including supporting various employee-led affinity groups, so its employees feel valued and appreciated for the distinct voices they bring to the team. 
As of December 31, 2021, the composition of our Board of Directors was 60% demographically diverse, which includes gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, national origin or other elements of one’s identity. Leadership positions were comprised of approximately 27% women globally and 15% racially diverse minorities in the United States. Our 2030 diversity goals set ambitious targets for Owens Corning leadership of 35% women globally and 22% racially diverse minorities in the United States. 
The Company performs a biennial pay equity review with the assistance of a third-party vendor. These reviews include a robust, statistical analysis of pay equity across the majority of its global salaried workforce. Consistent with our commitment to “equal pay for equal work,” we remediate all identified and substantiated pay gaps through pay increases. Further, the Company has implemented processes and policies to avoid inheriting unequal pay bias of prior employers.
Ethics and compliance efforts include our support of the Owens Corning Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct”), which is dedicated to encouraging compliance with a range of legal guidelines and our corporate values. Our training efforts encompass

the Code of Conduct and other areas of compliance and development as relevant to employees. We also seek to foster positive and productive relations with the labor organizations representing them. 
Owens Corning employees contribute service hours to boards, special causes and nonprofit organizations in the communities where they live and operate. These programs aim to enable the Company’s employees to connect with the community, further improve its reputation locally and globally, and instill a sense of pride in the workforce.
