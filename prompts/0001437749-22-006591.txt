ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Our Company
 
We are a specialty ingredient company that utilizes proprietary stabilization and separation technologies, supported by specialty milling processes, to deliver critical nutritional and functional ingredients derived from rice and other small and ancient grains for the food, nutraceutical, companion animal and equine feed categories. We are focused on milling rice and other small and ancient grains and producing, processing, and marketing value-added healthy, natural and nutrient dense products derived from these grains. Notably, we are a market leader in North America in converting raw rice bran into stabilized rice bran (SRB) and high value SRB derivative products including:

● | RiBalance, a complete rice bran nutritional package derived from further processing SRB;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | RiSolubles, a highly nutritious, carbohydrate and lipid rich fraction of RiBalance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | RiFiber, a protein and fiber rich insoluble derivative of RiBalance; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our family of ProRyza products, which includes derivatives composed of protein and protein/fiber blends.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Over the past decade, we have developed our products by optimizing our proprietary processes to support the production of healthy, natural, and non-genetically modified ingredients that are hypoallergenic and gluten free for use in baked goods, cereals, coatings, health foods, high-end animal nutrition, and animal health products. Our existing and target customers are food and animal nutrition manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, both domestically and internationally.
 
We incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 2000. From July 2003 until October 2012, our corporate name was “NutraCea.” In October 2012, we changed our name to RiceBran Technologies. In 2018, we moved our corporate headquarters to Texas. Over the past several years, we have acquired and divested of certain businesses:
 

● | 2019 – Acquired MGI Grain Processing, LLC., an East Grand Forks, Minnesota based company now operating as MGI Grain, Incorporated (MGI) which operates a grain mill and processing facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 2018 – Acquired Golden Ridge Rice Mills, LLC, a Wynne, Arkansas based company now operating as Golden Ridge Rice Mills, Inc. (Golden Ridge) which operates a rice mill in Wynne, Arkansas,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We currently source SRB at four locations: two raw rice bran stabilization facilities located within supplier-owned rice mills in Arbuckle and West Sacramento, California, one company-owned rice bran stabilization facility in Mermentau, Louisiana, and our wholly-owned rice mill, Golden Ridge, in Wynne, Arkansas. “Stage II” refers to the products produced using proprietary processing equipment and technology for further processing of SRB into finished products. We produce our Stage II products including: RiSolubles, RiFiber, RiBalance, and our family of ProRyza products at our Dillon, Montana facility.
 
Rice Mill
 
On November 28, 2018 we acquired Golden Ridge Rice Mills, LLC, a recently constructed rice milling and bran stabilization facility on nearly 32 acres in Wynne, Arkansas. Golden Ridge provides us with a presence in the largest rice-producing state and a cost-efficient source of SRB that is close to many of our customers in the Midwest and Eastern U.S. Golden Ridge specializes in producing #1 and #2 Grade U.S. premium long and medium white rice milled to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) standards, as well as brown rice, brewers rice, and brokens. We believe these products offer synergies to our core SRB business and should enable our sales team to deepen our relationship with our customers. Golden Ridge adheres to standard operating procedures and passed all the prerequisite audits required to meet Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards and Safe Quality Food (SQF) certifications.

Barley and Oats Mill
 
On April 4, 2019, we acquired MGI Grain Processing, LLC’s grain milling and processing facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota which specializes in processing barley, oats, and mustard. MGI provides us with a milling presence in a key production region in the U.S. and a complimentary portfolio of barley and oat ingredients, as well as other ancient grains. This creates synergy with our rice and rice bran products as they are purchased by substantially the same buyers as our rice products. MGI’s facility is an American Institute of Baking (AIB) certified barley pearling facility, Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) and SQF certified.
Our Products
 
We believe our greatest market opportunities are in the food ingredient and animal nutrition markets. Nutritionally balanced, minimally processed, gluten free, non-GMO and clean-label food and animal feed ingredients are in high demand, and we are strategically positioned to take advantage of this growing and sustainable market opportunity as discussed below in “Our Growth Strategy.”
Food Ingredients
 
Our SRB and SRB derivative products are nutritional and beneficial food products that contain a unique combination of oil, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fibers, and antioxidants that enhance the nutritional value of popular consumer products. Our products replace ingredients like soy protein isolate, soy protein concentrate, modified food starch, pea protein, mustard flour and yeast at a significantly reduced cost. Foods that are ideally suited for the addition of our SRB to their products include processed meats, cereals, snacks, beverages, baked goods, breading, and batters.
Animal Nutrition
 
Our SRB is marketed as a feed ingredient in the United States and international animal nutrition markets, and we will continue to pursue sales opportunities with attractive margins in those markets. SRB is currently used as an equine feed ingredient as it has been shown to provide health benefits for show and performance horses. We believe that there are also numerous market opportunities for utilizing SRB in the production of food for companion animals. We have multiple engagements with customers in the companion animal market, and we are aggressively pursuing other opportunities.
About Rice Bran
 
Rice is the staple food for over half of the world’s population, especially in some of the world’s most populous countries. Asia accounts for roughly 90% of global rice production and China is the world’s number one rice producer. Globally, the United States ranks 11th in rice production with approximately 2% of the global total.
 
When harvested from the field, individual rice kernels are stored in common receiving locations such as farm silos for future delivery to grain dryers or area rice mills. At this stage, large quantities of individual rice kernels are collectively called “paddy rice,” or “rough” rice. In this form, the rice kernel is fully enveloped by the rice hull, which serves as a protective cover, shielding the inner rice kernel from damage.
 
After storage and drying, paddy rice is cleaned of foreign material (scalping, de-stoning and aspiration) before it enters the first stage of milling, or paddy husking. In the paddy husker, the hull is removed from rough rice by differential speed rubber rollers. Loosened hulls are carried off by aspiration. After husking, a paddy separator uses a reciprocating motion to separate normal brown rice kernels (caryopsis) from unhusked kernels which are returned to the paddy husker.
 
Once husked, the outer brown layers of bran are removed from the inner white starch endosperm by an abrasive or frictional milling process which produces a milled, white rice kernel. After milling, white rice is typically sorted by size to remove broken pieces of rice kernels from whole kernels, as well as color sorting to remove discolored kernels. Further processing may be required (per customer specifications) to polish the white rice to a smooth surface.
 
Raw rice bran collected from the milling process is composed of rice germ and several sub-layers (pericarp, testa, nucellus and aleurone) surrounding the white starchy endosperm. Commercial rice bran makes up approximately 10% of rough rice by weight. Rice germ, an especially nutrient rich material, makes up approximately 10% of commercial rice bran by weight.
 
As brown rice is milled into white rice, the oils present in raw rice bran come into contact with native lipase enzymes that are naturally present in the rice kernel. These lipase enzymes initiate a rapid enzymatic hydrolysis of the oil, converting oils (triglycerides) into monoglycerides, diglycerides and free fatty acids (FFA). As the FFA content builds in raw rice bran, the bran becomes unpalatable and off flavors (rancidity) develop.
 
    5 

  

If left unchecked, enzymatic degradation at normal room temperatures can increase the FFA levels to 5-8% within 24 hours and can continue at a rate of approximately 4-5% per day thereafter. Enzymatic degradation is the most serious form of degradation of raw rice bran. Rice bran stabilization is the process of carefully deactivating native enzymes to prevent the increase of FFA otherwise caused by lipase enzyme activity. Proper stabilization is critical in the preservation of the nutritional value of the bran.
 
Historically, there have been a number of attempts to develop rice bran stabilization techniques, including the use of chemicals, microwave heating or variations of existing extrusion technology. Many of these approaches have had limited success in part because they have produced rice bran with limited shelf life or with significant degradation of nutrients.
 
Our Technologies
 
Our Proprietary Rice Bran Stabilization Technology
 
Our stabilization process uses proprietary processes to create a combination of temperature, pressure and other conditions necessary to thoroughly deactivate enzymes without significantly damaging the structure or nutrient content of the raw rice bran. This means that higher value compounds in bran, such as oils, proteins and phytonutrients are left undamaged and are available for utilization. Our process does not use chemicals to stabilize raw rice bran.
 
We install our stabilizers in close proximity to a rice mill so that freshly milled raw rice bran can be delivered quickly. Process logic controllers maintain exact process conditions within the prescribed pressure/temperature regime. In case of power failure or interruption of the flow of fresh bran into the system, the electronic control system is designed to purge the equipment of materials in process and resume production only after proper operating conditions are re-established.
 
Once stabilized, SRB leaving our system is then discharged onto cooling units specifically designed to control air pressure and humidity. Once cooled, SRB can be loaded into bulk hopper trucks for large volume customers or sent by pneumatic conveyor to a bagging unit for packaging into various size bags or 2,000-pound sacks.
 
Each of our stabilizers can process approximately 2,000 pounds of bran per hour and has a capacity to produce over 7,200 tons of SRB per year. Stabilization production capacity can be doubled, tripled or further multiplied by installing additional units sharing a common conveyor and stage system. We have also developed and tested a smaller production unit, with a maximum production capacity of 600 pounds per hour, for installation in locations where rice mills are substantially smaller than those in the United States.
 
Additional proprietary processes involve enzyme treatment of SRB to produce fractions enriched in one or more macronutrients, including proteins, fibers, lipids and micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals and phytosterols, among others. In these processes, SRB is put into an aqueous slurry, where it is treated with one or more enzymes, centrifugally separated and the fractions are dried on drum driers, spray driers or other drying systems.
 
SRB Attributes
 
Rice bran is free of all major allergens and is a valuable source of protein with a balanced amino acid profile for food ingredient products and is rich in healthy oil, vitamins, antioxidants, dietary fiber and other nutrients. The approximate composition and caloric content of our SRB is as follows:
 

Fat (oil) | 18-23% 
--------------------+--------------
Protein | 12-16% 
Total Dietary Fiber | 20-30% 
Moisture | 4-8% 
Ash | 6-14% 
Calories | 3.2 kcal/gram

 
Because SRB contains approximately 18-23% oil, it has a favorable fatty acid composition and excellent heat stability which makes it an attractive ingredient for a wide variety of applications.
 
    6 

  

Intellectual Property
 
Our stabilization and processing activities are an adaptation and refinement of standard food processing technology applied to rice bran. We have chosen to treat our methods and processes as a trade secret and not to pursue process or process equipment patents on the original processes. As we develop improvements, we intend to periodically review whether we should seek patent protection for them. We believe that certain unique products, and their biological effects, resulting from our SRB may be patentable in the future. We also hold a number of U.S. registered trademarks and trade names and have applied for additional marks.
 
We continue to support internal as well as external R&D efforts that improve on existing technologies or lead to the development of new technologies relating to rice bran processing and applications.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We are pursuing a simple growth strategy based on a few key initiatives to grow our markets and business, improving our financial condition, and maximizing shareholder value. The following points summarize our growth strategy:

1. | Product Line Expansion:
---+------------------------


● | Continued Expansion of SRB Derivatives – Ri-Solubles; in both conventional and organic forms, is a premium product in our portfolio which we believe offers significant upside potential, and we are focused on expanding production and sales. Ri-Fiber is an excellent source of dietary fiber that can provide organoleptic improvements in a range of supplement products, and potentially an excellent feedstock for further processing to isolate nutritional and functional components. Both products are produced at our Dillon, MT manufacturing facility which we optimized in 2021 to expand production capacity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New Stabilized Rice Bran (SRB) Formats – In early 2021, we introduced a variant of SRB with guaranteed low microbial levels, which eliminated the need for further heat processing prior to human consumption. SRB can be used as an excipient and flow agent in tablets, capsules, and nutritional powders. We believe this new low microbial SRB will provide access to new applications particularly in the supplement category as it will allow for the replacement of chemically derived ingredients enabling natural and non-GMO claims to be made on finished consumer products. We are also working on other processes to alter the taste profile of SRB, which we believe could expand the applications for SRB and significantly enhance our addressable market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Value-Added Blending Capabilities – We currently have the capability to deliver SRB in various levels of granularity, which allows our customers flexibility in how they use our products in their own applications. We hope to enhance the values of our core products further by adding the capability to combine them with other ingredients in order to deliver improved nutrition, functionality, and organoleptic properties. Other ingredient components will be sourced from both domestic and international supply partners and likely to include plant-based protein and carbohydrates. Combinations of rice ingredients and other grains from MGI and third-party sources will also be pursued.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Further Organic Expansion: While we currently have several organic product lines, notably an organic version of our rice bran derivative products and certain organic milled grain products, we believe there is a significant opportunity to further expand our organic product offering. In 2021, we significantly expanded our access to organic feedstock through enhanced supplier agreements and increased our ability to process this feedstock through optimization of our Dillon, MT facility. We also expanded both the number of organic SKUs and the overall volume of organic feedstock processed at our MGI Grain facility, and we are continuing to review the opportunity to convert Golden Ridge rice mill, such that it can mill organic rice and produce organic SRB.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Sales Initiative Expansion: We have restructured and established three business groups each headed by a senior sales executive who will be responsible for the commercial strategy and execution of the business groups across all product lines.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Value-Add – This group will build on our existing business in the supplement and wellness categories by expanding market penetration, introducing new products and blending capabilities, and developing partnerships with third-party developers and manufacturers to be able to deliver near-finished solutions to supplement brands and manufacturers. In 2021, we announced a partnership with AIDP, one of the leading distributors in this market, which we expect to accelerate market penetration.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Core-SRB – The key focus of this group is to expand the current business in processed foods, companion animal and equine feeds, including developing product line extensions and enhanced application, and the optimum go-to-market structure for these categories. In 2021, we made significant strides in increasing our presence in companion animal markets through a combination of increased sales to existing customers and new customer wins.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Milling – The key focus of this group is to improve the operating performance of our Golden Ridge rice mill and MGI Grain operations through enhanced management and the adoption of shared services and best practices. In 2021, this enabled strong growth and improved profitability for both businesses as both facilities benefited from significant enhancement in operating KPIs and a shift in both facilities to a more specialty focused customer base.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Supply Chain Expansion: Partnership with key rice mills in California and Louisiana will remain a cornerstone of our stabilized rice bran manufacturing strategy. We remain committed to expanding these partnerships by driving incremental volume, efficiency improvements, and expanding the core product opportunity. We will seek to implement long-term supply agreements with our suppliers with the objective of driving profit growth for both ourselves and our partners. We may also pursue partnerships with international producers, particularly in Asia. This could create opportunities for accessing new products based on new rice varieties and differentiated process technologies these partners possess.

The global and domestic markets are strong and rapidly expanding for minimally processed plant-based ingredients that provide dense and balanced nutrition in addition to evidence-based functionalities while also being non-GMO, gluten free and free of all major allergens. The regulatory requirements to add front-of-label warnings on food items and increasing demand from consumers for foods that list fewer and less processed ingredients is driving food companies to replace standard food ingredients with cleaner ingredients, such as SRB. We anticipate further incorporation of our food ingredients by major consumer packaged goods food companies as more food companies adopt rice bran as a standard clean label food ingredient. This trend is not limited to food ingredients, as we are finding similar transition to clean ingredients among high-end animal nutrition companies.
 
Our Customers
 
We use internal sales staff, outside independent sales representatives and third-party distributors to market our portfolio of products to customers domestically and internationally. In 2021 and 2020, three customers accounted for 32% and 26% of our revenues, respectively. We continue to focus efforts on diversification of our customer base to mitigate the concentration of customers.
Government Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to federal, foreign, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to zoning, workplace safety and accommodations for the disabled, and our relationships with our employees are subject to regulations, including minimum wage requirements, anti-discrimination laws, overtime and working conditions and citizenship requirements.
 
In both our United States and foreign markets, we are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations and other constraints exist at the federal, state and local levels in the United States, and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions, including regulations pertaining to the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale and storage of our products. In addition, we are subject to regulations regarding product claims and advertising.
 
The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, primarily the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the USDA. Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are manufactured and sold, as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States. Among other matters, regulation by the FDA and FTC is concerned with product safety and claims made with respect to a product’s ability to provide health-related benefits. Specifically, the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and sale of food and food ingredients. The FTC regulates the advertising of these products.
 
Federal agencies, primarily the FDA and the FTC, have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them, including initiating investigations, issuing warning letters and cease-and-desist orders, requiring corrective labeling or advertising, requiring consumer redress such as requiring that a company offer to repurchase products previously sold, seeking injunctive relief or product seizures, imposing civil penalties or commencing criminal prosecution. In addition, certain state agencies have similar authority. These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the food and food ingredient industries, including the imposition of civil penalties.
 
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), enacted January 4, 2011, amended the FDCA to significantly enhance the FDA’s authority over various aspects of food regulation. The FSMA granted the FDA mandatory recall authority when the FDA determines there is a reasonable probability that a food is adulterated or misbranded and that the use of, or exposure to, the food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. One of the more significant changes under FSMA is the requirement of hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls (HARPC) for all human and animal food processing facilities. We are committed to FSMA compliance and are SQF certified at all our facilities.
 
Any substance that is intentionally added to food is a food additive and is subject to premarket review and approval by the FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the use of the substance is otherwise excluded from the definition of a food additive. When an additive is proposed for use in a meat, its safety, technical function and conditions of use must also be evaluated by the USDA. Because the USDA retains jurisdiction over meat products and food ingredients intended for use in meats, the use of our SRB meat enhancers is regulated by this agency. SRB has USDA approval for use in certain meat products.
 
Animal feed ingredients are regulated by the FDA at the federal level and by the individual states. Our SRB is defined for animal use as heat stabilized rice bran for use as a feed ingredient.

Our Competition
 
There are a number of companies that have invested significant resources to develop technologies for stabilizing and processing rice bran and who market rice bran products into multiple markets around the world. We believe that we have proprietary technologies and processes for stabilizing rice bran and, as such, have developed significant brand recognition in the animal feed and food ingredient product sectors both domestically and internationally. Together with our decades of application technology know-how and proprietary processing methods, we believe that we have a competitive advantage over other suppliers with respect to producing SRB.
 
We are aware of several new producers of rice-based animal nutrition and food ingredient products in the United States, Europe and Asia. We believe that our major competitors include producers of isolated soy protein, wheat bran and oat bran, particularly in the food ingredients market segment. We compete with other companies that offer products incorporating SRB as well as companies that offer other food ingredients. Many consumers may consider such products to be a replacement for the products we manufacture and distribute.
 
Human Capital
 
We employ a skilled workforce within a broad range of functions. As of December 31, 2021, we had 101 employees. All our employees are located throughout the United States to serve our business operations. From year to year, we experience normal variable labor fluctuation at our production facilities.
 
We attract and retain our workforce through a dynamic and inclusive culture by providing a safe work environment, flexible work arrangements, and competitive pay and benefits, including access to personal health advocates offering independent guidance.
 
We believe that we have positive relationships with our employees and have deployed programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
